      "heading": "1.3 The Role of Innovation Systems in Sustainable Transitions",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Innovation systems play a pivotal role in facilitating sustainable transitions by providing the necessary structures, mechanisms, and interactions that drive systemic change. Sustainable transitions refer to the process of shifting from unsustainable practices to more sustainable systems, encompassing environmental, social, and economic dimensions. Innovation systems, which consist of the network of actors, institutions, and processes that generate, diffuse, and utilize knowledge, are essential in enabling this transformation. They act as conduits for integrating new ideas, technologies, and practices that support sustainability goals, ensuring that these innovations are not only developed but also implemented effectively.\n\nOne of the key aspects of innovation systems in sustainable transitions is their ability to foster systemic change. This involves not just technological innovation but also organizational, cultural, and regulatory shifts. For instance, the integration of digital technologies into traditional industries is not merely a matter of adopting new tools but requires rethinking business models, operational processes, and stakeholder interactions. This systemic change is crucial for achieving sustainability, as it enables organizations to address environmental challenges while maintaining economic viability. According to the paper titled \"Modeling Digital Penetration of the Industrialized Society and its Ensuing Transfiguration,\" the Fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by the deeper integration of digital technologies into professional and social spaces, presents an opportunity to meaningfully serve society. However, this requires a unified model of the industrialized ecosystem that covers value creation, value consumption, enabling infrastructure, required skills, and additional governance. Such a model aligns with the need for systemic change by ensuring that all stakeholders are on the same transformation journey [20].\n\nMoreover, innovation systems are instrumental in the integration of digital technologies into sustainable processes.

It notes that while digital tools are essential for gathering information and making decisions, the final decisions often rely on contextual information provided by human networks. This highlights the need for innovation systems to balance technological capabilities with human expertise and social dynamics [21].\n\nFurthermore, innovation systems support the development of sustainable business models that align with the principles of the circular economy. These models emphasize resource efficiency, waste reduction, and the reuse of materials, which are critical for achieving long-term sustainability. The paper titled \"Digital Entrepreneurship in Circular Economy\" discusses how digital technologies can support circular economy principles by enabling resource optimization, waste reduction, and sustainable product design. It underscores the importance of innovation systems in promoting such models, as they provide the necessary infrastructure and support for digital entrepreneurs to implement sustainable practices [14].\n\nThe role of innovation systems in sustainable transitions is also evident in the context of policy and governance. Effective policies and regulatory frameworks are essential for creating an environment that encourages innovation and sustainability. The paper titled \"Policy and Governance in Digital Entrepreneurship\" emphasizes the importance of supportive policies that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It argues that digital entrepreneurship policies should not only promote technological innovation but also ensure that these innovations contribute to environmental, social, and economic sustainability [22].\n\nMoreover, innovation systems must address the challenges posed by the digital divide and the need for equitable access to digital technologies. The paper titled \"Digital Transformation: Environmental Friend or Foe\" highlights the potential negative environmental impacts of digital transformation, such as the proliferation of data centers and the increased energy consumption associated with digital technologies. It calls for a balanced approach that considers both the benefits and the challenges of digitalization, emphasizing the need for innovation systems to promote sustainable and inclusive digital transformation [5].\n\nIn conclusion, innovation systems are crucial in facilitating sustainable transitions by enabling systemic change and integrating digital technologies into sustainable processes. They provide the necessary structures and mechanisms for fostering collaboration, developing sustainable business models, and creating supportive policies. By addressing the challenges of the digital divide and promoting equitable access to digital technologies, innovation systems ensure that the benefits of digital transformation are widely shared, contributing to a more sustainable and inclusive future. The papers cited in this discussion highlight the multifaceted role of innovation systems in driving sustainable transitions and underscore the importance of a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to achieving sustainability goals."

      "heading": "1.4 The Global Context of Digital Entrepreneurship",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Digital entrepreneurship has emerged as a transformative force in the global landscape, driven by the rapid evolution of digital technologies and their profound impact on business models, innovation processes, and sustainable development. However, the global context in which digital entrepreneurship operates is far from uniform. It is shaped by a complex interplay of global trends, digital divides, and the need for equitable access to digital technologies. Understanding this context is essential for grasping the challenges and opportunities faced by digital entrepreneurs worldwide.\n\nGlobal trends, such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI), and the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), have created a new ecosystem for entrepreneurship. These trends have enabled the creation of digital platforms, which serve as critical enablers for digital startups. Digital platforms, such as e-commerce marketplaces and cloud computing services, have reduced the barriers to entry for entrepreneurs, allowing them to reach global markets with minimal capital [6]. However, these trends also highlight the growing digital divide, which remains a significant challenge in the global context of digital entrepreneurship.\n\nThe digital divide refers to the gap between those who have access to digital technologies and those who do not. This divide is not only a technological issue but also a socio-economic one, as it reflects broader inequalities in access to education, income, and infrastructure. In many regions, especially in the Global South, the digital divide is a major obstacle to the growth of digital entrepreneurship. For instance, in countries like India, despite the rapid digital transformation, rural micro-entrepreneurs still face significant challenges in accessing e-commerce platforms due to limited digital infrastructure and low digital literacy [23]. The lack of reliable internet connectivity, affordable digital devices, and digital skills hinders the ability of these entrepreneurs to leverage digital tools for business growth and sustainability.\n\nThe global context of digital entrepreneurship is further complicated by the uneven distribution of digital resources and the dominance of a few large tech companies. These companies, often based in the Global North, have a significant influence over the digital ecosystem, shaping the rules and standards that govern digital platforms. This concentration of power can lead to a form of \"data colonialism,\" where digital resources are controlled by a few entities, limiting the ability of entrepreneurs in the Global South to innovate and compete [17].

This suggests that automation can contribute to sustainable development by improving efficiency and reducing waste. Nevertheless, the transition to an automated economy must be managed carefully to avoid exacerbating social inequalities. For instance, there is a need for retraining and upskilling programs to help workers adapt to the changing job market.\n\nIn addition to these issues, the ethical implications of AI in digital entrepreneurship cannot be overlooked. AI systems, while powerful, can perpetuate biases and discrimination if not designed and deployed responsibly. A study titled *Towards an Ethical Framework in the Complex Digital Era* [54] emphasizes the importance of developing ethical frameworks that consider the broader social and environmental impacts of digital technologies. The paper argues that ethical frameworks must move beyond the individual level and address the systemic challenges posed by digital technologies. This includes ensuring that AI systems are transparent, accountable, and inclusive, and that they do not reinforce existing power imbalances.\n\nThe ethical and social considerations of digital entrepreneurship are further complicated by the rapid pace of technological change. As new technologies emerge, they often outpace the development of regulatory frameworks and ethical guidelines, creating a regulatory lag that can lead to unintended consequences. A study titled *The Energy Worker Profiler from Technologies to Skills to Realize Energy Efficiency in Manufacturing* [48] highlights the need for continuous learning and capacity building to ensure that workers and organizations can adapt to these changes. This underscores the importance of fostering a culture of continuous innovation and ethical reflection in the digital entrepreneurship ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, the societal impact of digital entrepreneurship extends beyond the immediate economic and technological dimensions. Digital technologies have the potential to transform social relationships and community dynamics, often in ways that are not fully understood. A study titled *The Role Of Social Media On Selected Businesses In Nigeria In The Era Of Covid-19 Pandemic* [34] highlights how social media platforms have become essential tools for businesses to navigate the challenges of the pandemic. However, the study also notes that the use of social media can exacerbate social inequalities, as not all businesses have the resources or skills to effectively leverage these platforms. This suggests that the ethical and social considerations of digital entrepreneurship must also take into account the broader social and cultural contexts in which these technologies are deployed.\n\nIn conclusion, the ethical and social considerations of digital entrepreneurship are complex and multifaceted. They require a nuanced understanding of the interplay between technological innovation, social equity, and environmental sustainability. By addressing issues such as data privacy, the digital divide, and the societal impact of automation and AI, digital entrepreneurs can contribute to a more inclusive and sustainable digital economy. The insights from the studies cited above provide a foundation for developing ethical and socially responsible digital entrepreneurship practices that align with the principles of sustainable transitions."

These structures include the availability of skilled labor, the presence of a supportive regulatory environment, and the availability of infrastructure. For example, the study on the role of ethics and sustainability in business innovation emphasizes the importance of creating a regulatory environment that supports sustainable innovation [52]. Without a supportive regulatory framework, digital entrepreneurs may struggle to develop and scale their solutions, as they may face regulatory hurdles that can increase costs and reduce efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, the economic barriers faced by digital entrepreneurs are multifaceted and include high initial investment costs, limited access to capital, pressure to deliver short-term returns, and the challenges of maintaining and scaling digital solutions. These barriers can be exacerbated by the lack of a supportive ecosystem and the global nature of the digital economy. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes access to funding, support for innovation, and the creation of a regulatory environment that encourages sustainable practices. Only by overcoming these economic barriers can digital entrepreneurs fully realize their potential to drive sustainable transitions and contribute to a more equitable and sustainable future."

      "heading": "6.3 Regulatory Barriers",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Regulatory barriers represent one of the most formidable challenges digital entrepreneurs face when attempting to launch and scale sustainable innovations. These barriers stem from the complex and often evolving nature of legal frameworks that govern digital technologies. As digital entrepreneurship increasingly intersects with sustainability goals, entrepreneurs must navigate a web of regulations that can impede their ability to innovate effectively. The need for clear legal frameworks becomes especially critical as digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT), are often at the forefront of these innovations. However, the regulatory environment surrounding these technologies is not always aligned with the pace of technological advancement, creating a significant gap between innovation and compliance.\n\nOne of the primary regulatory challenges is the issue of compliance with complex and evolving laws. Digital entrepreneurs often find themselves in a situation where they must comply with multiple regulations that may not be entirely clear or consistent. For instance, data privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union impose strict requirements on how data is collected, stored, and used. Entrepreneurs may not have the expertise or resources to navigate these regulations effectively, which can lead to legal risks and potential penalties. The emergence of new digital technologies often outpaces the development of relevant regulations, resulting in a regulatory environment that is both uncertain and challenging for entrepreneurs [5]. This uncertainty can stifle innovation, as entrepreneurs may hesitate to invest in new technologies without a clear understanding of the legal implications.\n\nMoreover, the complexity of the regulatory landscape can create additional hurdles for digital entrepreneurs. For example, the implementation of blockchain technology in various sectors, such as finance and supply chain management, requires a thorough understanding of the legal and regulatory implications. Blockchain's decentralized nature can challenge traditional regulatory frameworks that are built on centralized oversight. Entrepreneurs may struggle to ascertain whether their applications comply with existing laws, leading to a potential for legal conflicts. The need for clear legal frameworks is thus not only a matter of compliance but also a necessity for fostering innovation and ensuring that digital entrepreneurs can operate within a predictable legal environment [86].\n\nAnother significant regulatory barrier is the lack of standardized regulations across different jurisdictions. Digital entrepreneurs operating in multiple regions may encounter varying regulations that can complicate their operations. For instance, the way data is regulated in one country may differ significantly from that in another, creating a fragmented regulatory landscape. This can lead to increased costs and complexity for entrepreneurs who must tailor their operations to meet the specific requirements of each region. As a result, the lack of harmonized regulations can hinder the scalability of digital solutions and limit the potential for cross-border collaboration and innovation [31].\n\nIn addition to these challenges, the regulatory environment often lacks the flexibility needed to accommodate the rapid evolution of digital technologies. Traditional regulatory frameworks are typically designed for stable and predictable environments, which can be at odds with the dynamic nature of digital innovation. As a result, digital entrepreneurs may find that their business models and strategies must constantly adapt to meet changing regulatory requirements. This can be particularly challenging for startups that may not have the resources to keep pace with these changes. The need for agile and responsive regulatory frameworks becomes increasingly important as digital technologies continue to evolve and disrupt traditional industries [51].\n\nFurthermore, the issue of data ownership and control adds another layer of complexity to the regulatory landscape. As digital entrepreneurs rely on data to drive their innovations, they must also navigate the legal implications of data ownership. In many cases, the data used to train AI algorithms and develop new digital solutions is collected from users, raising questions about consent, transparency, and ethical use. The lack of clear guidelines on data ownership can lead to disputes and legal challenges, which can be detrimental to the growth and sustainability of digital ventures [53]. Ensuring that data is used responsibly and ethically is not only a legal requirement but also a moral imperative for digital entrepreneurs.\n\nThe regulatory barriers faced by digital entrepreneurs also extend to the area of intellectual property (IP) rights. As digital technologies enable the creation of new products and services, the question of who owns the IP rights becomes increasingly complex. Entrepreneurs may find themselves in situations where they must navigate a labyrinth of IP laws and regulations to protect their innovations. This can be particularly challenging in a globalized market where IP rights may vary significantly across different regions. The lack of clear and consistent IP regulations can create uncertainty for entrepreneurs, potentially deterring investment and innovation [2].\n\nIn summary, regulatory barriers pose significant challenges for digital entrepreneurs, particularly when it comes to compliance with complex and evolving laws, data privacy regulations, and the need for clear legal frameworks. The lack of standardized regulations, the complexity of the regulatory landscape, and the need for flexible and responsive regulatory frameworks can all hinder the ability of digital entrepreneurs to innovate and scale their solutions. Addressing these regulatory challenges is essential for fostering a supportive environment that encourages digital entrepreneurship and sustainable innovation. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, it is crucial for policymakers to work closely with entrepreneurs to develop regulations that are both protective and conducive to innovation [51]."

      "heading": "6.4 Social Barriers",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Digital entrepreneurship, while promising, faces significant social barriers that hinder the widespread adoption and acceptance of digital solutions. These social barriers include societal resistance to digital adoption, cultural differences, and the need for education and awareness to foster acceptance of digital solutions. Addressing these challenges is crucial for ensuring that digital innovations can be effectively integrated into society and contribute to sustainable transitions.\n\nOne of the primary social barriers to digital adoption is societal resistance. This resistance can stem from a variety of factors, including fear of change, skepticism about the benefits of digital technologies, and concerns about job displacement. For example, some individuals may resist adopting new technologies because they perceive them as a threat to traditional ways of life or as a source of job loss. This resistance is particularly prevalent in communities where digital literacy is low, and access to digital tools is limited. Research indicates that in many regions, especially in the Global South, there is a significant gap in digital literacy and access, which exacerbates societal resistance to digital adoption [57]. This resistance can hinder the implementation of digital solutions, even when they have the potential to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance service delivery.\n\nCultural differences also play a significant role in shaping the acceptance of digital solutions. In some cultures, there may be a strong preference for face-to-face interactions and traditional methods of communication. This can create a barrier to the adoption of digital technologies, which may be perceived as impersonal or less trustworthy. For instance, in some communities, the use of digital platforms for business transactions or public services may be met with skepticism due to concerns about security, privacy, and the reliability of online systems. This cultural resistance can be particularly challenging in regions where digital technologies are still in the early stages of adoption. For example, in certain African countries, the use of digital tools for governance and public services may be met with resistance due to a lack of trust in digital systems and a preference for traditional methods of engagement [124]. Therefore, understanding and respecting cultural differences is essential for designing and implementing digital solutions that are both effective and acceptable to local communities.\n\nThe need for education and awareness is another critical social barrier to digital adoption. Without adequate education and training, individuals may lack the skills and knowledge necessary to use digital technologies effectively. This is particularly true in rural and low-income communities, where access to digital education and training programs is often limited. Research shows that digital literacy is a key factor in determining the success of digital initiatives, and without it, the potential benefits of digital technologies may not be fully realized [56]. For example, in the context of e-commerce for rural micro-entrepreneurs, the lack of digital literacy and access to training programs can prevent individuals from fully leveraging digital tools to expand their markets and improve their livelihoods [23]. This highlights the importance of investing in education and awareness campaigns to build digital skills and foster a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nMoreover, the social barriers to digital adoption are not limited to individual resistance but also include systemic challenges. These include the lack of digital infrastructure, which can limit access to digital technologies, and the presence of digital divides, which can exacerbate existing inequalities. For example, in many developing countries, the lack of reliable internet connectivity and the high cost of digital devices can prevent large segments of the population from accessing digital solutions [57]. This digital divide not only limits access to digital technologies but also reinforces existing social and economic disparities. Addressing these systemic challenges requires a multi-faceted approach that includes investments in digital infrastructure, policies to promote digital inclusion, and initiatives to bridge the digital divide.\n\nIn addition to these challenges, the social barriers to digital adoption also include the need for a cultural shift towards digital acceptance and the development of a digital mindset. This cultural shift involves not only individual attitudes but also the collective values and norms of society. For instance, in some cultures, there may be a reluctance to embrace new technologies due to a lack of awareness of their potential benefits. This can be particularly challenging in communities where traditional practices are deeply ingrained and where the adoption of new technologies may be perceived as a threat to cultural identity. To overcome this, it is essential to engage communities in the design and implementation of digital solutions, ensuring that they are tailored to local needs and values [124]. This participatory approach can help build trust and foster a sense of ownership among community members, increasing the likelihood of successful digital adoption.\n\nFurthermore, the social barriers to digital adoption highlight the importance of addressing the ethical and social implications of digital technologies. For example, the use of digital tools for data collection and analysis can raise concerns about privacy, surveillance, and the potential for misuse. These ethical concerns can lead to resistance from individuals and communities who may feel that their rights and freedoms are being compromised. Research indicates that the ethical implications of digital technologies must be carefully considered to ensure that their deployment is both fair and just [90]. This requires the development of ethical frameworks and guidelines that can guide the responsible use of digital technologies and ensure that their benefits are equitably distributed.\n\nIn conclusion, the social barriers to digital adoption are complex and multifaceted, encompassing societal resistance, cultural differences, and the need for education and awareness. These barriers must be addressed through a combination of strategies, including investments in digital infrastructure, policies to promote digital inclusion, and initiatives to build digital skills and foster a culture of innovation. By addressing these social barriers, digital entrepreneurship can play a more significant role in driving sustainable transitions and contributing to a more inclusive and equitable digital society."

      "heading": "6.5 Data and Privacy Concerns",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "The issue of data and privacy concerns is a critical challenge for digital entrepreneurship in the context of sustainable transitions. As digital technologies become increasingly integral to business operations, the reliance on user data raises significant questions about data ownership, privacy, and security. This subsection explores the complexities of these challenges, drawing on relevant research to highlight the issues that digital entrepreneurs must navigate as they integrate data-driven solutions into their sustainable business models.\n\nOne of the primary concerns in data and privacy is the ownership of user data. Digital technologies, especially those in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), often depend on vast amounts of user data to function effectively. However, this raises ethical and legal questions about who truly owns the data. For instance, in the context of smart agriculture, where IoT devices are used to monitor soil health and optimize crop yields, the data generated by these devices often belongs to the farmers. However, the companies that provide the IoT platforms may also claim ownership, leading to potential conflicts [19]. This ambiguity in data ownership can hinder the ability of digital entrepreneurs to build trust with their users, which is essential for long-term sustainability.\n\nPrivacy is another critical issue that digital entrepreneurs face. As digital platforms collect and analyze user data, the risk of privacy breaches becomes a pressing concern. The increasing use of AI in decision-making processes, for example, raises questions about how data is used to influence consumer behavior. Research indicates that users are often unaware of how their data is being used, leading to a lack of informed consent [17]. This lack of transparency can erode consumer trust and ultimately affect the success of digital entrepreneurial ventures. Moreover, the rise of data-driven business models can lead to the commodification of user data, where individuals' personal information is treated as a product to be bought and sold, further complicating the ethical landscape [27].\n\nSecurity is yet another dimension of data and privacy concerns that digital entrepreneurs must address. The increasing reliance on digital technologies exposes businesses to a range of security threats, including cyberattacks and data breaches. The consequences of such incidents can be severe, not only in terms of financial loss but also in terms of reputational damage and loss of customer trust. For example, in the healthcare sector, where digital solutions are increasingly used to manage patient data, the risk of data breaches can have life-altering implications. Research has shown that the healthcare industry is particularly vulnerable to cyber threats, given the sensitive nature of the data involved [33]. Digital entrepreneurs must invest in robust security measures to protect user data and maintain the integrity of their digital platforms.\n\nThe challenges of data and privacy are further compounded by the rapid pace of technological innovation. As new technologies emerge, they often outpace existing regulatory frameworks, leaving a gap in the protection of user data. For instance, the rise of decentralized technologies such as blockchain has introduced new possibilities for data management, but it also presents challenges in terms of data governance and accountability [92]. While blockchain can offer enhanced security and transparency, the lack of standardized practices and the complexity of the technology can make it difficult for digital entrepreneurs to implement these solutions effectively. Moreover, the decentralized nature of blockchain can complicate the enforcement of data protection regulations, as there is no central authority to oversee compliance.\n\nAnother significant challenge is the digital divide, which exacerbates data and privacy concerns for marginalized communities. As digital technologies become more pervasive, those without access to digital infrastructure or digital literacy may be left behind, facing greater risks of data exploitation. Research indicates that in regions with limited internet access, users are often less aware of the potential risks associated with data sharing, making them more vulnerable to privacy violations [23]. This disparity in digital access can create a situation where the benefits of digital innovation are not equitably distributed, further entrenching existing inequalities.\n\nFurthermore, the ethical implications of data usage in digital entrepreneurship cannot be overlooked. As digital entrepreneurs leverage user data to drive innovation and create value, they must also consider the broader societal impact of their actions. The use of AI in decision-making processes, for example, can lead to biased outcomes if the data used is not representative of the diverse populations it aims to serve [26]. This can result in the reinforcement of existing social inequalities and the marginalization of certain groups. Digital entrepreneurs must therefore adopt ethical frameworks that prioritize fairness, transparency, and accountability in their data practices.\n\nIn addition to these challenges, the issue of data governance is a complex and evolving landscape. The lack of clear guidelines on how data should be collected, stored, and used can create confusion for digital entrepreneurs. Research has shown that many organizations struggle to navigate the regulatory requirements related to data protection, leading to inconsistent practices and potential legal risks [125]. As a result, there is a growing need for standardized frameworks that provide clarity and guidance for digital entrepreneurs in managing data responsibly.\n\nIn conclusion, the challenges of data and privacy in digital entrepreneurship are multifaceted and require a comprehensive approach to address. From issues of data ownership and privacy to security concerns and ethical implications, digital entrepreneurs must navigate a complex landscape as they integrate data-driven solutions into their sustainable business models. By addressing these challenges proactively, digital entrepreneurs can build trust with their users, foster innovation, and contribute to the broader goals of sustainable development [17]."

      "heading": "6.6 Digital Divide",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "The digital divide remains one of the most pressing challenges in the realm of digital entrepreneurship, particularly in the context of sustainable transitions. It refers to the gap between those who have access to digital technologies and the internet and those who do not. This divide is not only a technological issue but also a socio-economic one, as it disproportionately affects marginalized communities, limiting their ability to participate in the digital economy and benefit from technological advancements. The barriers posed by the digital divide include unequal access to digital infrastructure, internet connectivity, and digital literacy, all of which hinder the participation of these communities in the digital ecosystem. \n\nOne of the primary barriers is the unequal access to digital infrastructure. In many parts of the world, particularly in developing countries, the lack of reliable and affordable internet access is a significant obstacle. For example, the study on digital divide among the States of Mexico reveals that inequalities persist between southern and southeastern states compared to central and northern states, with cell phone availability increasing and fostering internet access [57]. This disparity highlights the need for targeted investments in digital infrastructure to ensure equitable access to digital resources. Without such investments, the digital divide will continue to widen, leaving many communities behind in the digital revolution.\n\nInternet connectivity is another critical factor. Even in areas where digital infrastructure is present, the quality and reliability of internet connectivity can vary significantly. In rural and remote areas, the lack of high-speed internet access limits the ability of individuals and businesses to engage in digital activities. This is particularly evident in the case of digital entrepreneurship in rural communities, where the study on factors influencing the adoption of ICT-enabled entrepreneurship applications in Namibian rural communities identifies high costs of devices and mobile internet as significant barriers [126]. The inability to access reliable internet connectivity not only hampers the growth of digital businesses but also limits the ability of entrepreneurs to reach wider markets and compete effectively.\n\nDigital literacy is another essential aspect of the digital divide. Even when individuals have access to digital technologies and internet connectivity, they may lack the necessary skills to use them effectively. The study on inclusive online learning in Australia highlights the importance of an array of social, environmental, and skills \"infrastructure\" to facilitate inclusive online learning [32]. This underscores the need for comprehensive digital literacy programs that address not only technical skills but also the broader context of digital inclusion. Without such programs, many individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities, may be unable to fully participate in the digital economy.\n\nThe digital divide also has significant implications for digital entrepreneurship in the context of sustainable transitions. The study on the role of digital platforms in entrepreneurial processes highlights the importance of external resources in entrepreneurial activities, noting that platform-based startups can move through the entire entrepreneurial process by combining available resources efficiently and effectively [6]. However, the digital divide can limit the ability of entrepreneurs from marginalized communities to access these platforms and resources, thereby hindering their ability to innovate and contribute to sustainable development.\n\nMoreover, the digital divide exacerbates existing inequalities, as the study on the digital agricultural revolution highlights the importance of digital technologies in improving traditional agricultural practices to adapt to climate change and promote sustainable farming [31]. However, without equitable access to digital technologies, many smallholder farmers, particularly in developing countries, may not be able to benefit from these advancements, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n\nThe digital divide also poses challenges for the implementation of sustainable initiatives in the context of digital entrepreneurship. The study on the energy worker profiler emphasizes the need to align internal competencies with the demands of digital innovation to maximize returns on investment [48]. However, without digital literacy and access to digital technologies, many workers may be unable to acquire the necessary skills to participate in the digital economy, thereby limiting the potential for sustainable innovation.\n\nThe digital divide is further compounded by the lack of digital inclusion policies and initiatives. The study on digital sovereignty strategies for every nation highlights the need for strategic approaches to protect digital assets and ensure that all nations can participate in the digital economy [29]. However, without targeted policies and investments in digital infrastructure and literacy, many marginalized communities may continue to be excluded from the benefits of digital entrepreneurship.\n\nIn addition, the digital divide can have broader societal implications, as the study on the role of digital platforms in entrepreneurial processes suggests that digital platforms can serve as enablers of sustainable entrepreneurship by providing access to markets, resources, and knowledge [6]. However, without addressing the digital divide, the potential of these platforms to drive sustainable development may remain unrealized.\n\nThe digital divide also affects the ability of individuals and communities to engage with digital technologies in ways that promote social sustainability. The study on digital tools for social sustainability highlights the importance of inclusive digital platforms and community engagement in fostering equitable and sustainable urban development [127]. However, without addressing the digital divide, these initiatives may not reach the most vulnerable communities, limiting their impact on social sustainability.\n\nIn conclusion, the digital divide remains a significant barrier to digital entrepreneurship and sustainable transitions. The challenges posed by unequal access to digital infrastructure, internet connectivity, and digital literacy must be addressed to ensure that all communities can participate in and benefit from the digital economy. By investing in digital infrastructure, promoting digital literacy, and implementing policies that support digital inclusion, we can work towards a more equitable and sustainable digital future. The studies discussed in this section underscore the importance of these efforts and highlight the need for a comprehensive approach to bridge the digital divide and empower marginalized communities.

      "heading": "6.7 Ethical and Governance Challenges",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Ethical and governance challenges are significant barriers to the effective and sustainable deployment of digital technologies in entrepreneurship. These challenges arise from the complex interplay between technological capabilities, societal values, and the need for responsible innovation. As digital technologies become more pervasive, the ethical implications of their use become increasingly critical. Issues such as algorithmic bias, transparency, and accountability are central to the governance of digital systems. These challenges not only affect the fairness and reliability of digital solutions but also influence public trust and the broader societal acceptance of these technologies.\n\nOne of the most pressing ethical dilemmas in digital entrepreneurship is algorithmic bias. Algorithmic bias occurs when machine learning models and other AI systems produce results that are systematically unfair to certain groups of people. This can happen due to biased training data or flawed algorithmic design. For instance, a study on the social impact of generative AI revealed that such technologies can exacerbate existing inequalities by reinforcing stereotypes and biases present in the data they are trained on [61]. This raises serious concerns about the fairness of digital solutions and the need for rigorous testing and auditing of AI systems to ensure they do not perpetuate discrimination. The paper also highlights the importance of transparency in AI systems, as opaque algorithms can make it difficult to identify and address biases.\n\nTransparency is another critical ethical and governance challenge in the use of digital technologies. The complexity of modern digital systems, particularly those involving AI and machine learning, often makes it difficult to understand how decisions are made. This lack of transparency can lead to mistrust among users and stakeholders. In the context of digital entrepreneurship, this can hinder the adoption of digital solutions and limit their potential to drive sustainable innovation. The paper on the ethical considerations of AR applications in smartphones emphasizes the importance of transparency in the development and deployment of AR technologies, noting that users must be aware of how their data is collected, used, and shared [101; 102].\n\nResponsible innovation is a key aspect of addressing ethical and governance challenges in digital entrepreneurship. Responsible innovation involves considering the broader social, environmental, and economic impacts of digital technologies throughout the innovation process. This includes ensuring that digital solutions are developed in a way that respects human rights, promotes social equity, and minimizes environmental harm. The paper on the impact of generative AI on socioeconomic inequalities and policy making underscores the need for responsible innovation, arguing that AI systems should be designed and deployed in a manner that reduces rather than exacerbates existing inequalities [60]. This requires a multidisciplinary approach that brings together technologists, ethicists, policymakers, and affected communities to ensure that digital solutions are developed with the public interest in mind.\n\nThe governance of digital technologies also presents significant challenges. Effective governance requires the development of clear policies, regulations, and standards that ensure the responsible use of digital technologies. However, the rapid pace of technological change often outstrips the ability of regulatory frameworks to keep up. This can create a regulatory vacuum, where the absence of clear guidelines leads to inconsistent practices and potential misuse of digital technologies. The paper on the implications of digitalization on business model change highlights the importance of aligning business models with ethical and governance considerations, noting that companies must navigate a complex landscape of regulatory requirements while also ensuring the responsible use of digital technologies [87]. This underscores the need for agile and adaptive governance frameworks that can respond to the dynamic nature of digital innovation.\n\nAnother critical governance challenge is the management of data and privacy. Digital technologies rely heavily on data, and the collection, storage, and use of personal data raise significant ethical and legal concerns. The paper on the digital identity and the effect of trust and reputation information on user judgment in the sharing economy highlights the importance of protecting user data and ensuring that individuals have control over their personal information [111]. This includes implementing robust data protection measures, ensuring transparency in data practices, and providing users with the ability to opt out of data collection and sharing. The paper on the security implications of digitalization also emphasizes the need for strong data governance to prevent the risks associated with data breaches and misuse [17].\n\nIn addition to these challenges, there is a growing need for international cooperation and standardization in the governance of digital technologies. The global nature of digital systems means that ethical and governance issues often transcend national boundaries. The paper on the impact of the digital transformation on the environment highlights the importance of international collaboration in addressing the environmental impact of digital technologies [5]. This includes developing common standards for data governance, promoting ethical AI development, and ensuring that digital technologies are used in a way that supports sustainable development. The paper on the future of work and ethics also emphasizes the need for a global perspective on the ethical implications of digital technologies, noting that the challenges of digitalization are not confined to any single country or region [106].\n\nIn conclusion, the ethical and governance challenges associated with the use of digital technologies in entrepreneurship are complex and multifaceted. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes the development of transparent and accountable digital systems, the promotion of responsible innovation, and the establishment of effective governance frameworks. By addressing these challenges, digital entrepreneurs can ensure that their innovations contribute to a more equitable, sustainable, and inclusive digital future."

      "heading": "6.9 Collaboration and Knowledge Gaps",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "The challenges of fostering collaboration between different stakeholders and the gaps in knowledge and expertise pose significant barriers to digital entrepreneurship, particularly in the context of sustainable transitions. These issues are deeply intertwined with the complexity of modern innovation ecosystems, where digital technologies, regulatory frameworks, and societal expectations must align to drive meaningful change. The lack of effective collaboration among stakeholders—ranging from entrepreneurs, technologists, and policymakers to academia and civil society—can lead to fragmented efforts, missed opportunities, and inefficiencies in the development and deployment of sustainable digital solutions [2]. \n\nOne of the primary challenges in fostering collaboration is the misalignment of goals and incentives among stakeholders. For instance, while digital entrepreneurs may focus on market-driven innovation and profitability, public sector organizations often prioritize social and environmental outcomes. This divergence can hinder the formation of meaningful partnerships and limit the scope of collaborative initiatives. Furthermore, the absence of shared data and knowledge frameworks exacerbates this issue, as stakeholders often operate in silos, with limited visibility into each other’s strategies and capabilities [65]. Without a common understanding of the challenges and opportunities, it becomes difficult to build trust and establish long-term collaboration.\n\nKnowledge and expertise gaps further compound these challenges. Digital entrepreneurship in the context of sustainability requires a multidisciplinary approach that integrates technical, economic, and social dimensions. However, many stakeholders lack the necessary expertise to navigate the complexities of sustainable innovation. For example, entrepreneurs may not have the technical knowledge to leverage advanced digital technologies like AI or IoT for sustainability purposes, while policymakers may lack the understanding of how these technologies can be harnessed for environmental and social good. This gap in expertise can result in the misapplication of technologies, leading to suboptimal outcomes or even unintended negative consequences [5].\n\nMoreover, the rapid pace of technological change presents a significant challenge for knowledge sharing and collaboration. New digital tools and platforms emerge constantly, and keeping up with these developments requires continuous learning and adaptation. However, many organizations and individuals lack the resources or training to stay abreast of these changes. This results in a situation where some stakeholders are left behind, unable to participate effectively in the digital innovation ecosystem. As a result, there is a growing risk of exclusion, where marginalized communities and smaller enterprises are unable to benefit from the opportunities presented by digital entrepreneurship [105].\n\nAnother challenge is the lack of standardized frameworks and metrics to evaluate the impact of collaborative efforts. Without clear benchmarks, it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of partnerships and identify areas for improvement. This lack of standardization can lead to confusion and inconsistency in how collaboration is approached, making it challenging to scale successful initiatives. Additionally, the absence of a shared language and understanding of key concepts can create barriers to communication and cooperation among stakeholders. For example, terms like \"digital twin,\" \"blockchain,\" or \"AI-driven sustainability\" may have different meanings and implications depending on the context, leading to misunderstandings and misaligned expectations [130].\n\nThe knowledge gaps are further exacerbated by the limited availability of research and data on the intersection of digital entrepreneurship and sustainability. While there is a growing body of literature on digital innovation, much of it focuses on technical aspects rather than the social and environmental dimensions.

      "heading": "6.10 Cultural and Organizational Resistance",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Cultural and organizational resistance presents a significant barrier to the adoption of digital innovation and entrepreneurial practices. This resistance is rooted in the entrenched norms, values, and structures of traditional organizations, which often prioritize stability, predictability, and established ways of operating over experimentation and change. Such resistance can manifest in various forms, including reluctance to embrace new technologies, resistance to new business models, and resistance to rethinking traditional hierarchies and decision-making processes. As digital entrepreneurship becomes more integral to sustainable transitions, understanding and addressing these cultural and organizational barriers is crucial.\n\nOne of the primary sources of cultural resistance lies in the deeply ingrained values and norms of traditional organizations. Many organizations have long-standing cultures that emphasize risk aversion, hierarchy, and a focus on short-term gains, which can make it difficult to justify investments in digital innovation that may not yield immediate returns. For instance, in industries where physical presence and traditional methods are the norm, there may be a strong cultural resistance to digital transformation. This resistance is often reinforced by the belief that digital technologies are not as reliable or effective as traditional methods, leading to skepticism about their potential to drive sustainable innovation [51].\n\nMoreover, organizational structures that are resistant to change can hinder the integration of digital solutions. Hierarchical organizations, where decision-making is concentrated at the top, often struggle with the decentralized and collaborative nature of digital entrepreneurship. This can lead to a lack of alignment between digital initiatives and organizational goals, as well as a lack of support for digital innovation at the operational level. For example, in the context of smart city infrastructure, traditional bureaucratic structures can impede the implementation of IoT-based solutions, as they may not be equipped to manage the complexity and fluidity of such systems [9].\n\nIn addition to structural resistance, there is also resistance rooted in the fear of job displacement and the loss of traditional roles. The adoption of digital technologies can lead to significant changes in the nature of work, which can be unsettling for employees who are used to traditional job roles. This fear can manifest as resistance to adopting new technologies, as employees may perceive digital innovation as a threat to their livelihoods. For instance, the rise of automation and AI in various sectors has led to concerns about job losses, which can create a cultural resistance to digital transformation [127].\n\nFurthermore, there is a cultural resistance to the sharing of data and knowledge, which is often a prerequisite for digital innovation. Traditional organizations may be reluctant to share data due to concerns about data privacy, security, and competitive advantage.

For example, in the context of sustainable agriculture, the lack of data sharing between farmers, researchers, and technology providers can impede the development of precision farming solutions that require access to diverse data sources [133].\n\nAnother aspect of cultural resistance is the resistance to change in organizational values and priorities. Many traditional organizations are not designed to prioritize sustainability as a core value. Instead, they may focus on profit maximization and shareholder value, which can conflict with the goals of digital entrepreneurship in the context of sustainable transitions. This can lead to a lack of investment in digital solutions that have long-term sustainability benefits but may not align with immediate financial goals. For example, in the energy sector, the shift towards renewable energy sources may be resisted by organizations that are heavily invested in fossil fuels and may not see the immediate financial benefits of transitioning to sustainable energy solutions [134].\n\nIn addition to cultural resistance, there is also resistance from traditional organizational practices and processes. Many organizations have established processes and procedures that are resistant to change, making it difficult to implement digital solutions that require new workflows and methodologies. This resistance can be particularly pronounced in industries with long-standing regulatory frameworks, where the adoption of digital technologies may require significant changes to existing compliance and reporting processes. For instance, in the healthcare sector, the integration of AI-driven diagnostics may be resisted by organizations that are not equipped to handle the regulatory and ethical implications of such technologies [135].\n\nMoreover, there is a lack of digital literacy and skills within traditional organizations, which can hinder the adoption of digital innovation. Many employees may not have the necessary skills to effectively use digital technologies, leading to resistance and skepticism about their value. This resistance can be exacerbated by a lack of training and development opportunities, which can prevent employees from adapting to new digital tools and practices. For example, in the context of sustainable software development, the lack of digital skills among developers can hinder the implementation of sustainable coding practices that require a deep understanding of both technical and environmental considerations [113].\n\nFinally, there is a resistance to change in the way organizations measure success and value. Traditional organizations often rely on financial metrics to evaluate performance, which can make it difficult to justify investments in digital solutions that may not have immediate financial returns but have long-term sustainability benefits. This resistance can be particularly challenging in the context of sustainable entrepreneurship, where the focus is on long-term environmental and social impacts rather than short-term profits. For example, in the context of circular economy initiatives, traditional organizations may be reluctant to invest in sustainable product design and waste reduction strategies that may not align with their existing profit-driven models [14].\n\nIn conclusion, cultural and organizational resistance poses significant challenges to the adoption of digital innovation and entrepreneurial practices. Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach that includes changing organizational cultures, rethinking traditional hierarchies, and investing in digital literacy and skills. By understanding and addressing these barriers, organizations can create an environment that is more conducive to digital entrepreneurship and sustainable transitions."

By fostering transparency, accountability, and shared responsibility, multi-stakeholder collaborations help create a more resilient and inclusive digital ecosystem [58].\n\nRegulatory sandboxes are another innovative governance model that facilitates digital innovation by allowing startups and entrepreneurs to test their products and services in a controlled environment. A regulatory sandbox is a framework that enables companies to experiment with new technologies and business models under the supervision of regulators, with temporary exemptions from certain regulatory requirements. This model is particularly useful for digital entrepreneurs who are developing solutions that may not fit within existing regulatory frameworks, such as blockchain-based platforms or AI-driven services. By providing a safe space for experimentation, regulatory sandboxes encourage innovation while minimizing the risks associated with untested technologies [86]. For example, regulatory sandboxes have been successfully used to pilot digital identity systems, allowing organizations to test self-sovereign identity (SSI) solutions while ensuring compliance with data privacy and security standards [73]. These sandboxes also enable policymakers to gain insights into emerging technologies, which can inform the development of more agile and responsive regulatory frameworks.\n\nIn addition to these models, the concept of open innovation is gaining traction as a governance strategy for digital innovation. Open innovation involves leveraging external ideas, technologies, and resources to enhance internal R&D processes and accelerate the development of new products and services. This model is particularly well-suited for digital entrepreneurship, where access to a broad range of digital tools and platforms can significantly enhance the ability of startups to scale and compete. For example, open innovation platforms can enable digital entrepreneurs to access cloud computing resources, AI frameworks, and IoT ecosystems, thereby reducing the barriers to entry and accelerating the development of sustainable digital solutions [152]. Furthermore, open innovation fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing among different stakeholders, promoting a culture of continuous learning and adaptation in the digital ecosystem [27].\n\nThe integration of these governance models into the broader digital innovation landscape is essential for fostering sustainable transitions. However, successful implementation requires careful consideration of several factors, including the alignment of governance frameworks with sustainability goals, the involvement of diverse stakeholders, and the ability to adapt to rapidly evolving technological and market conditions. For instance, while PPPs and multi-stakeholder collaborations can provide the necessary support for digital innovation, they also require strong coordination mechanisms to ensure that all parties are aligned in their objectives and commitments [153]. Similarly, regulatory sandboxes must be designed to balance the need for experimentation with the need for oversight, ensuring that new technologies are developed in a way that is both innovative and responsible [154].\n\nMoreover, the role of governance models in digital innovation is not limited to facilitating the development of new technologies. These models also play a critical role in addressing the ethical and social implications of digital technologies. For example, multi-stakeholder collaborations can help ensure that digital innovations are developed in a way that respects user privacy, promotes digital inclusion, and minimizes the risk of bias and discrimination [155]. Similarly, regulatory sandboxes can be used to test the ethical implications of emerging technologies, such as AI and blockchain, and to develop guidelines for responsible innovation [156].\n\nIn conclusion, governance models such as public-private partnerships, multi-stakeholder collaborations, and regulatory sandboxes are essential for enabling digital innovation and supporting sustainable transitions. These models provide the necessary infrastructure, resources, and frameworks to foster experimentation, collaboration, and scaling of digital solutions. By adopting these governance approaches, policymakers, entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders can create a more inclusive, resilient, and sustainable digital ecosystem that benefits all members of society [2]. As digital technologies continue to evolve, the development and refinement of these governance models will be crucial in ensuring that innovation is aligned with the broader goals of sustainability, equity, and social progress."

      "level": 3,
      "content": "Data governance and privacy regulations play a crucial role in shaping the digital entrepreneurship landscape by ensuring ethical use of data while fostering innovation and trust. As digital technologies become increasingly integral to business operations, the need for robust frameworks to manage data and protect individual privacy has become more pressing. Data governance refers to the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data used in an organization. It involves the establishment of policies, procedures, and standards that ensure data is handled responsibly and in compliance with legal requirements. Privacy regulations, on the other hand, focus on protecting individuals' personal information and ensuring that data is collected, stored, and used in a manner that respects individuals' rights and preferences.\n\nThe role of data governance in digital entrepreneurship is multifaceted. It helps ensure that data is used ethically and transparently, which is essential for building trust with customers and stakeholders. Effective data governance frameworks enable digital entrepreneurs to make informed decisions about data collection, storage, and usage, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and other security incidents. Furthermore, data governance supports the development of data-driven business models by ensuring that data is accurate, consistent, and accessible. This is particularly important in sectors such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, where the quality and integrity of data can have a significant impact on business outcomes [78].\n\nIn the context of digital entrepreneurship, privacy regulations are equally important. They provide a legal framework that protects individuals' personal information and ensures that data is used in a manner that respects their rights. Privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States have set global standards for data protection. These regulations require organizations to obtain explicit consent from individuals before collecting and using their data, and they provide individuals with the right to access, correct, and delete their personal information. By complying with these regulations, digital entrepreneurs can build trust with their customers and avoid the legal and reputational risks associated with data misuse [17].\n\nThe interplay between data governance and privacy regulations is essential for fostering innovation in the digital entrepreneurship ecosystem. While data governance ensures that data is managed responsibly, privacy regulations provide the necessary legal safeguards to protect individuals' rights. Together, they create a balanced environment where innovation can thrive without compromising individual privacy. This balance is particularly important in the context of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), which rely heavily on data for their operation. For example, AI systems require large amounts of data to train and improve their performance, but they must also be designed to respect individuals' privacy and data protection rights [25].\n\nThe emergence of data governance and privacy regulations has also influenced the way digital entrepreneurs approach data collection and usage. In the past, many digital entrepreneurs focused primarily on maximizing data collection to drive business growth, often at the expense of individual privacy. However, with the increasing awareness of data privacy issues and the implementation of stricter regulations, digital entrepreneurs are now more mindful of how they handle data. This shift has led to the development of more transparent data practices, such as the use of data minimization principles, which involve collecting only the data that is necessary for a specific purpose. Additionally, digital entrepreneurs are increasingly adopting privacy-by-design approaches, which integrate data protection measures into the development of digital products and services from the outset [78].\n\nAnother important aspect of data governance and privacy regulations is their role in promoting data sovereignty. Data sovereignty refers to the right of individuals and organizations to control their own data and determine how it is used. In the context of digital entrepreneurship, data sovereignty is crucial for ensuring that digital entrepreneurs have the autonomy to manage their data and protect it from unauthorized access or misuse. This is particularly important in the context of global data flows, where data may be transferred across borders and subjected to different legal regimes. By implementing data governance frameworks that emphasize data sovereignty, digital entrepreneurs can ensure that their data is protected and that they retain control over its usage [58].\n\nThe impact of data governance and privacy regulations on digital entrepreneurship is not limited to compliance and risk management. They also play a key role in shaping the competitive landscape of the digital economy. Organizations that are able to effectively manage their data and protect individual privacy are more likely to gain a competitive advantage in the market. This is because consumers are increasingly concerned about how their data is used and are more likely to support organizations that demonstrate a commitment to data privacy and ethical data practices. As a result, digital entrepreneurs that prioritize data governance and privacy are better positioned to build strong relationships with their customers and differentiate themselves from competitors [17].\n\nMoreover, data governance and privacy regulations are essential for fostering innovation in the digital entrepreneurship ecosystem. By providing a clear legal framework for data usage, these regulations create a level playing field for all digital entrepreneurs, regardless of their size or resources. This is particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which may lack the resources to implement robust data governance practices. By adhering to data governance and privacy regulations, SMEs can ensure that they are operating in a manner that is consistent with legal requirements and that they are not at risk of facing legal penalties or reputational damage [49].\n\nIn conclusion, data governance and privacy regulations are essential components of the digital entrepreneurship ecosystem. They play a crucial role in ensuring that data is used ethically and transparently, while also fostering innovation and trust. By implementing effective data governance frameworks and adhering to privacy regulations, digital entrepreneurs can build strong relationships with their customers, protect their data, and differentiate themselves in the market. As the digital economy continues to evolve, the importance of data governance and privacy regulations will only continue to grow, making them a critical area of focus for digital entrepreneurs and policymakers alike [78]."

Regulatory frameworks must be designed to be agile and responsive to the dynamic nature of digital innovation. As suggested in the paper *AI Governance and Ethics Framework for Sustainable AI and Sustainability*, this can be achieved through the development of flexible regulatory sandboxes, which allow entrepreneurs to test and refine their innovations in a controlled environment. Such sandboxes can help bridge the gap between technological advancement and regulatory oversight, enabling entrepreneurs to experiment with new technologies while ensuring compliance with key ethical and legal standards.\n\nFurthermore, the paper *Sustainability in Software Product Lines: Report on Discussion Panel at SPLC 2014* emphasizes the importance of embedding sustainability into the design and development of digital technologies. Regulatory policies should encourage the adoption of sustainable practices by setting clear expectations for environmental, social, and economic performance. This can be achieved through the creation of sustainability certifications, incentives for green technology development, and the establishment of clear benchmarks for digital innovation. By aligning regulatory requirements with sustainability goals, policymakers can create a more supportive environment for digital entrepreneurs to innovate and grow.\n\nAnother critical aspect of regulatory adaptation is the need for stakeholder engagement and collaboration. The paper *Boundary Spanning and the Support of Digital Entrepreneurs: A Case Study of Bahrain* highlights the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships in fostering digital entrepreneurship. Regulatory frameworks should involve input from a wide range of stakeholders, including entrepreneurs, industry experts, and civil society organizations, to ensure that policies are informed by real-world challenges and opportunities. This collaborative approach can help create regulations that are not only effective but also equitable and inclusive.\n\nFinally, the paper *Sustainable Development Goals as unifying narratives in large UK firms' Twitter discussions* illustrates the role of public discourse in shaping regulatory priorities. Digital entrepreneurs can benefit from policies that encourage transparency, accountability, and public engagement in the regulatory process. By fostering an open and participatory regulatory environment, policymakers can create a more dynamic and responsive framework that supports the growth of sustainable digital innovation.\n\nIn conclusion, the regulatory challenges faced by digital entrepreneurs in the context of sustainable transitions are multifaceted and require a coordinated and adaptive approach. By addressing the complexities of regulatory frameworks, fostering agility and responsiveness, and promoting collaboration among stakeholders, policymakers can create an environment that supports the growth of sustainable digital innovation. This, in turn, will enable digital entrepreneurs to play a more significant role in driving the transition towards a more sustainable and equitable future."

For example, the intersection of digital innovation and sustainability is a rich area for interdisciplinary research. Scholars from different fields can collaborate to develop comprehensive frameworks that address the multifaceted nature of sustainability. This could involve examining the ethical and social implications of digital technologies, as well as their economic and environmental impacts [52]. Future research should also explore the role of digital platforms in fostering innovation and entrepreneurship, particularly in the context of rural and developing economies [23].\n\nAnother critical area for future research is the examination of the broader implications of digital innovation on sustainability. While digital technologies have the potential to drive sustainable development, their adoption and use can also have unintended consequences. For example, the energy consumption associated with digital infrastructure, such as data centers and cloud computing, poses significant environmental challenges [9]. Future research should investigate the trade-offs between the benefits of digital innovation and its environmental costs, and explore strategies for mitigating these impacts. This could involve developing energy-efficient technologies, promoting the use of renewable energy sources, and implementing policies that encourage sustainable digital practices.\n\nMoreover, the role of digital entrepreneurship in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is an area that requires further exploration. While some studies have examined the contribution of digital technologies to specific SDGs, such as climate action and clean energy [28], there is a need for more comprehensive research that assesses the overall impact of digital entrepreneurship on the SDGs. This could involve analyzing the extent to which digital solutions are being used to address the SDGs and identifying best practices for leveraging digital entrepreneurship to achieve these goals.\n\nIn addition to these technological and policy-related areas, there is a need for research that examines the social and cultural dimensions of digital entrepreneurship. The adoption of digital technologies can have varying impacts on different communities, and understanding these differences is crucial for developing inclusive and equitable digital solutions [47]. Future research should explore how digital entrepreneurship can be tailored to meet the specific needs of diverse communities, and how it can contribute to social equity and inclusion.\n\nAnother important area for future research is the development of frameworks and models that support the sustainable growth of digital entrepreneurship. This includes the creation of business models that integrate sustainability principles, as well as the development of policies and regulations that foster innovation and entrepreneurship [64]. Future research should also investigate the role of digital ecosystems in supporting digital entrepreneurs, and how these ecosystems can be leveraged to create value and drive sustainable development.\n\nFinally, there is a need for research that examines the long-term implications of digital entrepreneurship for sustainable transitions. This includes understanding the potential for digital solutions to scale and have a lasting impact on sustainability goals. Future research should explore the factors that contribute to the success or failure of digital entrepreneurship initiatives, and how these initiatives can be optimized to achieve sustainable outcomes [27]."

      "heading": "10.6 Call to Action for Stakeholders",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "The call to action for stakeholders is essential to advancing digital entrepreneurship and supporting sustainable development. As highlighted throughout this survey, digital entrepreneurship plays a pivotal role in addressing global challenges, from climate change to social inequality, through innovative digital solutions. However, the success of these efforts depends on the collaborative efforts of researchers, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and industry leaders. By working together, stakeholders can create an ecosystem that fosters innovation, drives sustainable growth, and ensures that digital technologies are used ethically and inclusively.\n\nOne of the primary actions that stakeholders must take is to foster collaboration among different sectors. This includes bridging the gap between academia and industry, ensuring that research findings are translated into practical solutions. For instance, the integration of digital technologies in agriculture, as discussed in \"The Digital Agricultural Revolution: A Bibliometric Analysis Literature Review\" [31], has shown the potential to improve traditional practices and promote sustainable farming. However, this requires coordinated efforts between researchers, farmers, and technology providers to ensure that digital tools are accessible and effective. By creating platforms for knowledge exchange, stakeholders can facilitate the development of innovative solutions that address the specific needs of different communities.\n\nIn addition to collaboration, stakeholders must prioritize the development of policies that support digital entrepreneurship and sustainable development. Policies should focus on creating an enabling environment that encourages innovation while also ensuring that the benefits of digital technologies are equitably distributed. For example, the paper \"Digital Sovereignty Strategies for Every Nation\" [29] emphasizes the importance of protecting digital assets and ensuring that countries maintain control over their digital infrastructure. This can be achieved through policies that promote digital inclusion, such as initiatives to improve access to digital technologies in rural and marginalized communities. By supporting these efforts, policymakers can help bridge the digital divide and ensure that all individuals have the opportunity to participate in and benefit from the digital economy.\n\nEntrepreneurs also play a crucial role in driving sustainable development through digital innovation. They must be encouraged to adopt sustainable business models that prioritize environmental and social responsibility. The paper \"Business Models for Digitalization Enabled Energy Efficiency and Flexibility in Industry: A Survey with Nine Case Studies\" [64] highlights the importance of developing business models that improve energy efficiency and enable energy flexibility. By adopting such models, entrepreneurs can not only reduce their environmental impact but also create value for their customers and stakeholders. To support this, stakeholders must invest in capacity-building programs that equip entrepreneurs with the skills and knowledge needed to implement sustainable practices.\n\nFurthermore, the role of researchers in advancing digital entrepreneurship and sustainable development cannot be overstated.
