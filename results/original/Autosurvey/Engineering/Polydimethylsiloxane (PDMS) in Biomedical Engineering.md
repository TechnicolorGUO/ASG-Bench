### 1.7 Comparison of PDMS with Other Biomaterials

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is one of the most widely used biomaterials in biomedical engineering due to its unique combination of properties such as biocompatibility, flexibility, transparency, and ease of fabrication. However, PDMS is not the only biomaterial available for biomedical applications. Other commonly used biomaterials include polyethylene glycol (PEG), polylactic acid (PLA), polyurethane (PU), and silicone elastomers, among others. Each of these materials has its own advantages and limitations, and the choice of material depends on the specific requirements of the biomedical application. This subsection provides a comprehensive comparison of PDMS with these other biomaterials, focusing on their properties, performance, and applicability in various biomedical contexts.

One of the most commonly used synthetic polymers in biomedical applications is PEG, which is known for its excellent biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, and resistance to protein adsorption [19]. PEG is often used in drug delivery systems, surface modifications, and as a component in hydrogels due to its ability to enhance the solubility and stability of therapeutic agents. However, unlike PDMS, PEG is not inherently elastic, and its mechanical properties are generally less favorable for applications requiring flexibility and deformability. Additionally, PEG is often used in conjunction with other materials to improve its mechanical properties, whereas PDMS can be used as a standalone material in many applications, such as microfluidics and tissue engineering.

Polylactic acid (PLA) is another biodegradable polymer that is frequently used in biomedical applications, particularly in tissue engineering and drug delivery systems. PLA exhibits good biocompatibility and mechanical strength, making it suitable for load-bearing applications such as bone grafts and scaffolds [24]. However, PLA is relatively brittle and lacks the flexibility of PDMS, which can be a significant limitation in applications that require repeated deformation or conformability to complex shapes. Furthermore, the degradation rate of PLA is relatively slow, which can be both an advantage and a disadvantage depending on the application. In contrast, PDMS is highly flexible and can be tailored to have a wide range of mechanical properties, making it more suitable for applications such as soft robotics and wearable sensors.

Polyurethane (PU) is another biomaterial that is widely used in medical devices such as catheters, implants, and wound dressings. PU is valued for its high elasticity, durability, and resistance to fatigue, making it suitable for long-term implantation [25]. However, PU can be challenging to process and may exhibit variability in mechanical properties depending on the formulation. Additionally, PU is not as transparent as PDMS, which limits its use in optical and imaging applications. PDMS, on the other hand, offers excellent optical transparency and can be easily fabricated into complex microstructures using soft lithography, making it a preferred material for microfluidic devices and lab-on-a-chip systems.

Silicone elastomers, which are closely related to PDMS, are also used in biomedical applications due to their biocompatibility, elasticity, and chemical inertness. However, unlike PDMS, silicone elastomers are often more rigid and less flexible, which limits their use in applications requiring high deformability [14]. PDMS, in contrast, is known for its exceptional flexibility and can be easily modified to enhance its surface properties, such as hydrophilicity or adhesion. These modifications are often necessary for PDMS to be used in cell culture and tissue engineering applications, where cell adhesion and proliferation are critical factors.

In addition to synthetic polymers, natural biomaterials such as collagen, chitosan, and alginate are also widely used in biomedical engineering. These natural materials are often chosen for their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ability to support cell growth [14]. However, natural biomaterials can be more difficult to process and may exhibit batch-to-batch variability in their mechanical and biological properties. PDMS, being a synthetic material, offers more consistent properties and can be easily tailored to meet specific requirements. For example, PDMS can be modified with functional groups to improve its interaction with biological systems, whereas natural materials may require extensive processing to achieve similar results.

Another important consideration in the comparison of PDMS with other biomaterials is their performance in specific applications. For instance, in microfluidic devices, PDMS is often preferred due to its ability to be precisely molded into complex microstructures and its excellent gas permeability, which is essential for cell culture [13]. In contrast, materials such as PLA or PEG may not offer the same level of precision or permeability, making them less suitable for such applications. Similarly, in drug delivery systems, PDMS can be used to create sustained-release devices due to its ability to control the diffusion of drugs, whereas other materials may require additional coatings or modifications to achieve similar effects.

Despite its many advantages, PDMS also has some limitations that should be considered when comparing it with other biomaterials. For example, PDMS has limited mechanical strength and may not be suitable for high-load applications such as orthopedic implants. In contrast, materials such as titanium alloys or certain bioceramics are preferred for such applications due to their high strength and durability [24]. Additionally, PDMS is not inherently conductive, which can be a limitation in applications requiring electrical conductivity, such as biosensors or wearable electronics. However, this limitation can be overcome through surface modifications or the integration of conductive materials.

### 1.8 Challenges in Utilizing PDMS for Biomedical Applications

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is widely used in biomedical engineering due to its favorable properties such as biocompatibility, transparency, and flexibility. However, despite its advantages, the utilization of PDMS in biomedical applications presents several challenges. These challenges include issues related to mechanical stability, surface modification requirements, and long-term biocompatibility, which can significantly impact the performance and reliability of PDMS-based devices in clinical settings.

One of the primary challenges associated with PDMS is its relatively poor mechanical stability. PDMS is a soft, elastomeric material with low tensile strength, making it susceptible to deformation under prolonged stress or mechanical loading. This limitation is particularly problematic in applications where PDMS is used as a structural component or in environments where it is subjected to repeated mechanical stress, such as in implantable devices or in dynamic biomedical environments. For instance, in the context of implantable devices, PDMS may experience mechanical failure due to its inability to withstand the high-stress conditions of the human body over extended periods [2]. This mechanical instability can lead to device degradation, reduced functionality, or even failure, thereby posing significant challenges for the development of long-term, reliable biomedical devices.

Another critical challenge is the requirement for surface modification to enhance the functionality of PDMS. PDMS inherently possesses low surface energy, which makes it hydrophobic and limits its ability to interact with biological systems. This property can hinder the adhesion of cells or biomolecules, which is essential for applications such as cell culture, biosensors, and drug delivery systems. To overcome this limitation, various surface modification techniques have been explored, including plasma treatment, chemical functionalization, and the use of adhesion promoters. However, these modifications often require additional processing steps and can introduce potential complications, such as altered material properties or reduced biocompatibility. For example, in the development of PDMS-based microfluidic devices, surface modifications are frequently necessary to ensure proper fluid handling and to prevent non-specific protein adsorption, which can compromise the accuracy of biological assays [13]. The need for such modifications not only increases the complexity and cost of device fabrication but also introduces additional variables that must be carefully controlled to maintain device performance.

Long-term biocompatibility is another significant challenge in the use of PDMS for biomedical applications. Although PDMS is generally considered biocompatible, its long-term stability within the human body remains a concern. Prolonged exposure to biological fluids and tissues can lead to the degradation of PDMS, potentially releasing byproducts that may be toxic or cause adverse biological responses. This issue is particularly relevant for implantable devices, where the material must maintain its structural integrity and functionality over extended periods. Studies have shown that the degradation of PDMS can result in the release of siloxane oligomers, which may have harmful effects on surrounding tissues [3]. Additionally, the interaction between PDMS and the immune system can lead to chronic inflammation or foreign body reactions, further complicating its use in long-term implantable applications.

Moreover, the challenges associated with PDMS in biomedical applications extend beyond its mechanical and biocompatibility properties. The material's low chemical reactivity and limited ability to be modified chemically can also hinder its integration with other biomaterials and technologies. For example, in the development of hybrid devices that combine PDMS with other materials, such as nanoparticles or polymers, the compatibility between PDMS and these materials can be a significant challenge. The inability to achieve strong interfacial adhesion between PDMS and other components can result in device failure or reduced performance [22]. This limitation necessitates the development of advanced surface modification techniques and the exploration of novel material combinations to enhance the compatibility and functionality of PDMS-based devices.

Another challenge is the difficulty in achieving precise control and sensing in PDMS-based systems. While PDMS is highly flexible and can be used to create intricate microstructures, its inherent softness can make it challenging to achieve the precision required for certain biomedical applications. For instance, in the development of PDMS-based biosensors, achieving consistent and reproducible sensor performance can be difficult due to the material's sensitivity to environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. This sensitivity can lead to variations in sensor response, which can affect the accuracy and reliability of the device [17]. To address this challenge, researchers have explored the use of advanced fabrication techniques and the integration of PDMS with other materials to enhance its mechanical and sensing properties.

In addition, the use of PDMS in biomedical applications is also limited by its environmental and chemical sensitivity. PDMS can be affected by exposure to solvents, temperature fluctuations, and UV radiation, which can alter its physical and mechanical properties over time. This sensitivity can be problematic in applications where the device is exposed to varying environmental conditions, such as in wearable health monitoring systems or in implantable devices. The degradation of PDMS under these conditions can lead to changes in device performance and reduced lifespan, further highlighting the need for more stable and resilient materials [13].

In summary, while PDMS offers numerous advantages for biomedical applications, its utilization is not without challenges. Mechanical stability, surface modification requirements, long-term biocompatibility, and environmental sensitivity are all significant hurdles that must be addressed to fully realize the potential of PDMS in biomedical engineering. Addressing these challenges will require continued research and innovation in material science, surface engineering, and device design to ensure the development of reliable, effective, and safe PDMS-based biomedical devices.

### 2.5 Surface Modification of PDMS

Surface modification of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a critical process to tailor its surface properties for specific biomedical applications. While PDMS is inherently hydrophobic and has poor adhesion to other materials, its surface can be modified using various techniques such as plasma treatment, chemical functionalization, and UV/ozone exposure. These modifications enhance its hydrophilicity, improve adhesion, and increase compatibility with biological systems, making it more suitable for applications such as cell culture, biosensing, and microfluidics. The need for surface modification arises from the limitations of pristine PDMS, such as its low surface energy, poor wettability, and lack of functional groups, which restrict its use in applications requiring specific surface interactions.

Plasma treatment is one of the most commonly used methods for modifying PDMS surfaces. This technique involves exposing PDMS to a plasma discharge, typically using oxygen, argon, or a mixture of gases. The plasma generates reactive species that interact with the PDMS surface, leading to the introduction of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), carbonyl (-C=O), and carboxyl (-COOH) groups [28]. These functional groups increase the surface energy of PDMS, making it more hydrophilic and improving its wettability. Additionally, the plasma treatment can also etch the surface, creating micro- or nano-scale roughness, which enhances adhesion with other materials. This method is particularly useful for preparing PDMS surfaces for cell culture, as it promotes cell adhesion and spreading [28].

Chemical functionalization is another widely employed method for modifying PDMS surfaces. This technique involves the covalent or non-covalent attachment of functional molecules to the PDMS surface. Covalent functionalization typically involves the use of silane coupling agents, such as 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) or 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GOPS), which react with the PDMS surface to form stable bonds. These silane molecules introduce functional groups that can further react with other molecules, such as proteins, antibodies, or biomolecules, to create specific surface functionalities [29]. Non-covalent functionalization, on the other hand, relies on physical adsorption or electrostatic interactions between the PDMS surface and the functional molecules. This approach is often used for attaching biomolecules without altering the surface chemistry of PDMS, making it suitable for applications such as biosensors and drug delivery systems [29].

In addition to plasma treatment and chemical functionalization, other surface modification techniques, such as UV/ozone exposure, can also be used to modify PDMS surfaces. UV/ozone treatment involves exposing PDMS to ultraviolet (UV) light in the presence of oxygen, which generates reactive oxygen species that oxidize the surface of PDMS. This process introduces hydrophilic functional groups and increases the surface energy of PDMS, similar to plasma treatment. However, UV/ozone treatment is often simpler and more cost-effective than plasma treatment, making it a popular choice for surface modification [28].

The importance of surface modification for PDMS in biomedical applications cannot be overstated. For instance, in microfluidic devices, the hydrophobic nature of PDMS can lead to poor fluid flow and difficulty in controlling the movement of liquids. Surface modification can overcome these challenges by improving the wettability and reducing the surface tension of PDMS, allowing for more precise control of fluid dynamics [30]. In cell culture applications, the hydrophobic nature of PDMS can inhibit cell adhesion and growth. Surface modification with bioactive molecules, such as fibronectin or collagen, can promote cell attachment and proliferation, making PDMS more suitable for 3D cell culture and tissue engineering [31].

Moreover, surface modification is essential for improving the compatibility of PDMS with biological systems. The native PDMS surface is inert and lacks specific functional groups that can interact with biological molecules. By introducing functional groups through surface modification, PDMS can be made more biocompatible and capable of supporting cellular interactions. This is particularly important for applications such as biosensors, where the surface of PDMS must interact with specific biomolecules to detect target analytes [17]. In drug delivery systems, surface modification can enhance the release kinetics of drugs by altering the surface properties of PDMS, allowing for more controlled and targeted delivery [32].

Despite the benefits of surface modification, there are several challenges and limitations associated with these techniques. One of the main challenges is maintaining the stability of the modified surface over time. Some surface modifications, such as those involving silane coupling agents, can degrade or lose functionality under certain environmental conditions, such as high humidity or prolonged exposure to biological fluids. Additionally, the effectiveness of surface modification can vary depending on the specific technique used and the conditions under which it is performed. For example, the degree of hydrophilicity introduced by plasma treatment can depend on factors such as the gas composition, plasma power, and exposure time [30].

In summary, surface modification of PDMS plays a crucial role in enhancing its properties for biomedical applications. Techniques such as plasma treatment, chemical functionalization, and UV/ozone exposure can significantly improve the hydrophilicity, adhesion, and biocompatibility of PDMS, making it more suitable for a wide range of applications. However, the effectiveness and stability of these modifications depend on the specific techniques used and the environmental conditions to which the modified PDMS is exposed. Future research should focus on developing more stable and efficient surface modification methods to further expand the utility of PDMS in biomedical engineering.

### 2.6 Mechanical Behavior of PDMS

The mechanical behavior of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) plays a critical role in its widespread use in biomedical engineering, particularly in flexible and stretchable devices. As a silicone-based polymer, PDMS is known for its exceptional viscoelastic properties, which allow it to deform under stress and recover its original shape when the stress is removed. This behavior is essential for applications that require compliance, such as wearable sensors, soft robotics, and microfluidic devices, where the material must conform to the shape of biological tissues or undergo repeated mechanical cycles without failure [33].

One of the key mechanical characteristics of PDMS is its viscoelasticity, which is a combination of elastic and viscous behavior. This property is due to the polymer’s molecular structure, which consists of a silicon-oxygen backbone with methyl groups attached to the silicon atoms. The flexibility of the Si-O-Si bonds allows the material to exhibit a high degree of molecular mobility, which contributes to its ability to deform and recover. The viscoelastic nature of PDMS is particularly important in biomedical applications where the material is subjected to dynamic loads, such as in the design of pressure sensors or flexible prosthetics [34].

PDMS also demonstrates a significant strain capacity, which is the maximum deformation the material can withstand before failure. This property is crucial for biomedical devices that require a high degree of stretchability, such as those used in soft robotics or epidermal electronics. The strain capacity of PDMS can be influenced by factors such as the cross-linking density, which determines the rigidity of the polymer network. Lower cross-linking density typically results in higher elasticity and greater strain capacity. For example, studies have shown that PDMS samples with lower cross-linking densities can stretch up to 500% of their original length without significant damage, making them suitable for applications that require high flexibility [35].

Another important aspect of PDMS’s mechanical behavior is its stress-strain response, which describes how the material deforms under applied force. The stress-strain curve of PDMS is typically nonlinear, with an initial region of low stiffness followed by a gradual increase in stiffness as the strain increases. This behavior is characteristic of hyperelastic materials, which can undergo large deformations while maintaining their structural integrity. The nonlinear stress-strain response of PDMS is advantageous in applications where the material must adapt to varying mechanical conditions, such as in the development of biomedical implants or wearable health monitoring systems [36].

The mechanical behavior of PDMS is also influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity. These factors can affect the polymer’s viscoelastic properties and its ability to withstand mechanical stress over time. For instance, higher temperatures can reduce the stiffness of PDMS, making it more prone to deformation under load. Conversely, lower temperatures can increase the stiffness of the material, potentially reducing its flexibility. These temperature-dependent changes in mechanical properties must be carefully considered when designing biomedical devices that are intended for long-term use in different environmental conditions [37].

In addition to its intrinsic mechanical properties, the mechanical behavior of PDMS can be modified through surface treatments or the addition of other materials. Surface modification techniques, such as plasma treatment or chemical functionalization, can alter the surface energy and adhesion properties of PDMS, which can indirectly influence its mechanical performance. For example, plasma treatment can increase the surface roughness of PDMS, improving its adhesion to other materials and enhancing its durability in biomedical applications. The addition of nanoparticles or other fillers can also modify the mechanical properties of PDMS, such as increasing its stiffness or improving its resistance to wear and tear [38].

The mechanical behavior of PDMS is also a key factor in its use in microfluidic systems, where the material’s flexibility and ability to conform to different shapes are essential for creating complex microchannel structures. The viscoelastic nature of PDMS allows it to be molded into intricate geometries with high precision, making it a popular choice for the fabrication of microfluidic devices. However, the mechanical properties of PDMS can also pose challenges in microfluidic applications, particularly in terms of maintaining the structural integrity of the device under repeated use. For example, the deformation of PDMS under cyclic loading can lead to the failure of microfluidic channels over time, which can affect the performance of the device [39].

In the context of biomedical devices, the mechanical behavior of PDMS is often evaluated through a combination of experimental and computational methods. Experimental techniques, such as tensile testing and indentation, are used to measure the mechanical properties of PDMS under different conditions. Computational models, on the other hand, can simulate the mechanical behavior of PDMS under various loading scenarios, providing insights into its performance in real-world applications. These approaches are essential for optimizing the mechanical properties of PDMS and ensuring its suitability for use in biomedical devices [40].

The mechanical behavior of PDMS also has implications for its long-term performance in biomedical applications. For example, the viscoelastic properties of PDMS can lead to hysteresis, where the material exhibits a lag between the applied stress and the resulting strain. This behavior can affect the accuracy and reliability of sensors that rely on PDMS as a flexible substrate. Additionally, the mechanical degradation of PDMS over time, such as the loss of elasticity or the formation of microcracks, can impact the performance of biomedical devices that require long-term stability [40].

Overall, the mechanical behavior of PDMS is a critical factor in its application in biomedical engineering. Its viscoelastic properties, strain capacity, and stress-strain response make it a versatile material for the development of flexible and stretchable devices. However, the mechanical behavior of PDMS is influenced by a variety of factors, including environmental conditions, surface treatments, and the addition of other materials. Understanding and controlling these factors is essential for optimizing the performance of PDMS-based biomedical devices and ensuring their reliability in long-term applications. [40].

### 2.7 Fabrication Challenges and Solutions

The fabrication of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a critical process in biomedical engineering, particularly in the development of microfluidic devices, sensors, and other advanced biomedical applications.

Over the years, researchers have developed various solutions to overcome these fabrication challenges, incorporating advanced techniques and materials to improve the overall quality and performance of PDMS structures.

One of the primary challenges in PDMS fabrication is achieving uniform thickness across the entire device. This is particularly important in microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip systems, where variations in thickness can lead to inconsistent fluid flow and inaccurate measurements. The issue arises from the inherent properties of PDMS, which is a soft, elastic material that can deform during the molding or casting process. The thickness of PDMS can be influenced by factors such as the viscosity of the prepolymer, the curing time, and the temperature during the curing process. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed several solutions. For example, the use of precise mold design and the optimization of the casting parameters, such as the use of a vacuum to remove air bubbles, can help achieve a more uniform thickness [4]. Additionally, advanced techniques such as spin-coating and dip-coating have been employed to create thin, uniform layers of PDMS, ensuring consistent thickness across the device surface.

Another significant challenge in PDMS fabrication is controlling surface roughness. Surface roughness can affect the adhesion of PDMS to other materials and influence the performance of the device, particularly in applications such as cell culture and biosensing. The roughness of PDMS surfaces can be influenced by the casting process, the type of mold used, and the surface treatment of the mold. For instance, molds with high surface roughness can transfer this roughness to the PDMS, leading to uneven surfaces that can interfere with the desired functionality of the device. To overcome this challenge, various surface modification techniques have been developed. One common approach is the use of plasma treatment, which can smooth the surface of PDMS and improve its adhesion properties [9]. Additionally, the use of high-quality molds with polished surfaces and the implementation of controlled casting conditions can significantly reduce surface roughness, ensuring a smoother and more uniform surface.

Ensuring air-tightness is another critical challenge in PDMS fabrication, particularly in microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip systems where leaks can compromise the integrity of the device and lead to inaccurate results. PDMS is a porous material, and during the curing process, air bubbles can become trapped within the material, creating potential pathways for leakage. The presence of air bubbles can also affect the mechanical properties of PDMS and lead to structural weaknesses. To address this issue, researchers have developed several strategies. One approach involves the use of vacuum degassing to remove air bubbles from the PDMS mixture before casting. This process is crucial for ensuring that the final device is free from defects that could compromise its performance [4]. Additionally, the use of high-quality molds with precise surface finishes can help minimize the risk of air bubble formation during the casting process.

In addition to the challenges mentioned above, the fabrication of PDMS also faces issues related to mechanical stability and durability, particularly in applications that require the device to withstand prolonged mechanical stress. PDMS is a relatively soft material, and its mechanical properties can be affected by factors such as the crosslinking density and the presence of additives. To enhance the mechanical stability of PDMS, researchers have explored the use of hybrid materials and composite structures. For example, the integration of PDMS with other polymers or the addition of reinforcing agents such as nanoparticles can significantly improve the mechanical properties of the material [13]. These approaches not only enhance the mechanical stability of PDMS but also improve its resistance to deformation under prolonged stress, making it more suitable for long-term applications.

Another challenge in PDMS fabrication is the difficulty in achieving precise control over the geometry and dimensions of the device. This is particularly important in applications where the device must be tailored to specific requirements, such as in microfluidic channels or biosensors. The fabrication process must ensure that the final device matches the design specifications, which can be challenging due to the elastic nature of PDMS. To address this issue, researchers have developed advanced fabrication techniques such as soft lithography, which allows for the creation of micro- and nano-scale structures with high precision [5]. Soft lithography involves the use of a master mold to create the desired patterns on PDMS, enabling the fabrication of complex geometries with high reproducibility. Additionally, the use of 3D printing techniques for PDMS fabrication has gained attention, as it offers greater flexibility in designing and producing complex structures with high accuracy [13].

In conclusion, the fabrication of PDMS presents several challenges that must be carefully addressed to ensure the performance and reliability of the final product. These challenges include achieving uniform thickness, controlling surface roughness, ensuring air-tightness, and maintaining mechanical stability. Through the development of advanced fabrication techniques and the use of complementary materials, researchers have made significant progress in overcoming these challenges.

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has emerged as a promising material in tissue engineering due to its biocompatibility, flexibility, and ease of fabrication. However, despite its advantages, several challenges must be addressed to fully realize its potential in tissue engineering applications. These challenges primarily revolve around mechanical stability, long-term biocompatibility, and the need for surface modifications to enhance its functionality for tissue engineering purposes [24].  

One of the most significant challenges in PDMS-based tissue engineering is its mechanical stability. PDMS is a highly flexible and soft material with low tensile strength, making it unsuitable for applications that require high mechanical resilience. In tissue engineering, scaffolds must provide adequate mechanical support to maintain the structural integrity of the growing tissue. However, PDMS's low mechanical strength can lead to deformation or failure under physiological loads, especially in load-bearing applications such as bone or cartilage engineering. Additionally, the viscoelastic nature of PDMS means that it can exhibit time-dependent deformation under sustained stress, which can compromise the long-term functionality of the engineered tissue [24].  

Another major challenge is the long-term biocompatibility of PDMS in vivo. While PDMS is generally considered biocompatible, its long-term stability within the body is still a concern. Over time, PDMS may degrade or release by-products that could elicit adverse immune responses. The degradation of PDMS can also affect the mechanical properties of the scaffold, leading to a loss of structural support for the growing tissue. Furthermore, the interaction of PDMS with biological fluids and tissues may lead to protein adsorption and cellular responses that can impact the behavior of the engineered tissue. Therefore, understanding the long-term effects of PDMS in biological environments is crucial for its safe and effective use in tissue engineering [24].  

Surface modifications are another critical challenge in PDMS-based tissue engineering. While PDMS is inherently biocompatible, its surface properties are not always favorable for cell adhesion and proliferation. The low surface energy of PDMS makes it hydrophobic, which can hinder cell attachment and promote non-specific protein adsorption. This can lead to reduced cell viability and altered cell behavior, which are detrimental to tissue engineering outcomes. To overcome these limitations, various surface modification techniques have been developed, such as plasma treatment, chemical functionalization, and the use of bioactive coatings. However, these modifications can introduce additional complexity and cost to the fabrication process. Moreover, the long-term stability and biocompatibility of modified PDMS surfaces need to be thoroughly evaluated to ensure their safety and effectiveness in vivo [24].  

In addition to mechanical and surface-related challenges, the integration of PDMS with other materials and technologies presents its own set of difficulties. For instance, while PDMS is widely used in microfluidic systems, its integration with advanced biomaterials and bioactive molecules can be complex. The compatibility between PDMS and other components, such as hydrogels, ceramics, or metallic structures, must be carefully considered to ensure the overall performance of the tissue-engineered construct. Moreover, the scalability of PDMS-based tissue engineering approaches remains a challenge, as large-scale production of PDMS scaffolds with consistent properties and reproducibility is difficult to achieve [24].  

Another challenge is the limited control over the mechanical and biological properties of PDMS scaffolds. While PDMS can be easily molded into various shapes, its mechanical properties are primarily determined by its molecular structure and crosslinking density. This makes it difficult to tailor the mechanical properties of PDMS scaffolds to match the specific requirements of different tissues. Furthermore, the biological properties of PDMS, such as its ability to support cell differentiation and tissue regeneration, are not as well understood as those of other commonly used biomaterials. This lack of detailed understanding can hinder the optimization of PDMS-based scaffolds for specific tissue engineering applications [24].  

The need for surface modifications also extends to the integration of PDMS with advanced technologies such as 3D printing and additive manufacturing. While PDMS is compatible with many fabrication techniques, its use in 3D printing processes requires careful optimization of printing parameters to ensure the desired mechanical and structural properties. Additionally, the integration of PDMS with other materials in multi-material 3D printing can be challenging due to differences in thermal and mechanical properties. These challenges must be addressed to fully leverage the potential of PDMS in advanced tissue engineering applications [24].  

In summary, while PDMS offers numerous advantages for tissue engineering, several challenges must be addressed to fully realize its potential. These challenges include mechanical stability, long-term biocompatibility, surface modifications, integration with other materials, and the need for precise control over its mechanical and biological properties. By addressing these challenges, PDMS-based tissue engineering can be further advanced, leading to the development of more effective and reliable tissue engineering constructs [24].

For example, PDMS-based custom-fit holders and supports are used to immobilize patients during imaging procedures, ensuring consistent positioning and reducing movement-related distortions. The material’s ability to be molded into complex shapes makes it ideal for creating patient-specific accessories that cater to the unique anatomical features of individuals. Furthermore, PDMS can be integrated into radiation shielding materials, where its flexibility allows for the creation of adaptable, lightweight shields that do not compromise the structural integrity of the imaging system [34].  

Beyond structural components, PDMS is being utilized in the development of microfluidic platforms that integrate with imaging systems to enable real-time monitoring of biological processes. In PET imaging, for instance, PDMS-based microfluidic devices are used to deliver radiotracers to the target tissue with high precision. These devices leverage PDMS’s optical transparency and chemical inertness to ensure that the radiotracers remain stable and uncontaminated during delivery. Additionally, PDMS’s compatibility with biological systems allows for the creation of hybrid imaging platforms that combine PET with other modalities, such as fluorescence imaging, to provide multimodal data for more comprehensive diagnostic insights [35].  

In MRI, PDMS is also being used to develop novel contrast agents and imaging phantoms. The material’s ability to encapsulate nanoparticles and other contrast-enhancing agents makes it a promising candidate for creating targeted imaging agents that can improve the detection of specific tissues or pathologies. For example, PDMS-based microspheres loaded with iron oxide nanoparticles have been explored as contrast agents for MRI, offering enhanced signal intensity and improved spatial resolution. These microspheres can be tailored to target specific cell types or tissues, enabling the visualization of molecular processes at a cellular level. Furthermore, PDMS is being used in the fabrication of imaging phantoms that mimic the mechanical and acoustic properties of biological tissues, allowing researchers to test and calibrate imaging systems under controlled conditions [36].  

Another area where PDMS is making a significant impact is in the development of flexible and stretchable sensors for integration with imaging systems. These sensors, often fabricated using PDMS as a substrate, can be used to monitor physiological parameters such as temperature, pressure, and strain during imaging procedures. For example, PDMS-based pressure sensors have been integrated into MRI-compatible devices to monitor the pressure exerted by the imaging coil on the patient’s body, ensuring optimal comfort and reducing the risk of tissue damage. These sensors are also being used in PET and CT systems to track the position and movement of internal organs, providing valuable data for motion correction algorithms that improve image quality [37].  

The application of PDMS in advanced imaging technologies extends to the development of bio-inspired imaging components that mimic the functionality of natural systems. For instance, PDMS has been used to create artificial corneas and lenses that replicate the optical properties of biological tissues. These components are being tested in optical coherence tomography (OCT) systems to improve the resolution and accuracy of retinal imaging. The flexibility and transparency of PDMS allow these artificial structures to adapt to the complex geometries of the eye, providing more accurate and reliable diagnostic data. Additionally, PDMS-based microstructures are being explored for use in optical imaging systems, where their ability to manipulate light at the microscale can enhance the resolution and sensitivity of imaging techniques [38].  

Moreover, PDMS is being utilized in the development of wearable imaging systems that combine flexible electronics with imaging technologies. These systems, which leverage PDMS as a flexible substrate, can be integrated into clothing or medical devices to enable continuous monitoring of physiological parameters. For example, PDMS-based flexible sensors have been used in wearable MRI systems to monitor the position and movement of the patient during imaging, ensuring optimal alignment and reducing motion artifacts. Similarly, PDMS is being used in the fabrication of flexible PET detectors that can be embedded in wearable devices, allowing for real-time monitoring of metabolic activity in the body [39].  

In summary, PDMS is playing a transformative role in advanced imaging technologies by enabling the development of flexible, biocompatible, and high-performance components that enhance the capabilities of MRI, CT, and PET systems. From flexible coils and patient-specific accessories to microfluidic platforms and wearable sensors, PDMS is being integrated into various aspects of imaging to improve diagnostic accuracy, patient comfort, and operational efficiency. The material’s unique properties, combined with its compatibility with advanced fabrication techniques, position PDMS as a key enabler of next-generation imaging technologies that address the evolving needs of modern healthcare.

### 7.6 PDMS in Integration with AI and Machine Learning for Imaging

For instance, PDMS-based microfluidic devices can be used to create biocompatible environments for cell cultures, which can then be imaged and analyzed using AI and ML algorithms. These algorithms can automatically segment and classify cells, enabling high-throughput analysis and faster diagnosis [2].

The use of PDMS in combination with AI and ML is also revolutionizing the field of diagnostic tools. PDMS's ability to be functionalized and modified makes it suitable for creating biosensors that can detect specific biomarkers in biological samples. When integrated with AI and ML algorithms, these biosensors can provide rapid and accurate diagnosis of various diseases. For example, PDMS-based biosensors can be used to detect biomarkers associated with cancer, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. The AI and ML algorithms can analyze the data from these biosensors in real-time, providing clinicians with actionable insights and enabling early intervention [21].

In addition to these applications, the integration of PDMS with AI and ML is also enabling the development of smart imaging systems that can adapt to changing conditions. For instance, PDMS-based imaging systems can be designed to adjust their parameters based on the specific requirements of the imaging task. This adaptability is crucial for ensuring high-quality images under varying conditions. The use of AI and ML algorithms allows these systems to learn from previous imaging tasks and optimize their performance over time, thereby improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of the imaging process [19].

Furthermore, the combination of PDMS with AI and ML is facilitating the development of advanced imaging systems that can handle large and complex datasets. The ability of AI and ML algorithms to process and analyze large volumes of data makes them ideal for applications such as image registration, where multiple images need to be aligned and compared. PDMS-based imaging components can be used to create high-resolution images that can be processed by these algorithms, enabling the accurate identification of anatomical structures and pathological features [2].

The integration of PDMS with AI and ML is also opening new possibilities for the development of personalized medical imaging solutions. By leveraging the flexibility and biocompatibility of PDMS, researchers can create custom imaging devices that are tailored to the specific needs of individual patients. These devices, when combined with AI and ML algorithms, can provide personalized insights into a patient's health and enable more effective treatment planning. For example, PDMS-based imaging systems can be used to create patient-specific models of organs and tissues, which can then be analyzed using AI and ML algorithms to predict the effectiveness of different treatment options [21].

In conclusion, the integration of PDMS with AI and ML technologies is revolutionizing the field of medical imaging and diagnostic tools. The unique properties of PDMS, combined with the advanced capabilities of AI and ML, are enabling the development of more accurate, efficient, and personalized medical imaging solutions. As research in this area continues to advance, the potential applications of PDMS in combination with AI and ML are expected to expand further, leading to significant improvements in healthcare outcomes. The continued exploration of this integration will undoubtedly contribute to the advancement of biomedical engineering and the development of innovative medical technologies [2].

### 7.7 Challenges and Limitations of PDMS in Medical Imaging

Despite its widespread use in biomedical engineering, Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) faces several challenges and limitations in medical imaging applications. Although PDMS is a versatile material known for its optical transparency, biocompatibility, and flexibility, its application in medical imaging requires careful consideration of its inherent constraints. One major challenge is its limited optical stability, which can affect the quality of image acquisition and signal detection in various imaging systems. This issue is particularly relevant in long-term or high-precision imaging scenarios, where any degradation in optical performance can lead to significant errors in diagnostic outcomes [18].

Optical stability in PDMS is influenced by factors such as environmental exposure, temperature fluctuations, and prolonged use. For instance, PDMS can undergo subtle changes in its refractive index over time, which can distort the accuracy of optical imaging systems that rely on consistent material properties. These changes can be exacerbated by the presence of contaminants, which can accumulate on the PDMS surface and further degrade optical performance. This poses a challenge for medical imaging systems that require high-resolution and consistent image quality, as even minor deviations in optical properties can affect the reliability of diagnostic data [18].

Another significant limitation of PDMS in medical imaging is its potential for contamination. As a highly porous and hydrophobic material, PDMS can easily absorb organic compounds, proteins, and other substances from its environment. This can lead to the formation of biofilms or the accumulation of non-specific binding, which can interfere with the imaging process. For example, in fluorescence imaging or other optical biosensing applications, the presence of contaminants can cause background noise, reduce signal-to-noise ratios, and lead to false-positive or false-negative results [18]. Such issues are particularly problematic in clinical settings, where accuracy and reliability are paramount.

Furthermore, the need for surface modifications to enhance the functionality of PDMS in specific imaging scenarios is a critical challenge. While PDMS exhibits excellent biocompatibility, its surface properties can be a limiting factor in certain imaging applications. For instance, PDMS surfaces are typically hydrophobic, which can hinder the adhesion of cells or other biological materials, making it unsuitable for applications such as cell imaging or tissue culture. To overcome this, surface modifications such as plasma treatment, chemical functionalization, or the application of bioactive coatings are often required [18].

However, these modifications can introduce additional complexities and cost factors. Plasma treatment, for example, can alter the mechanical and chemical properties of PDMS, potentially affecting its performance in imaging systems. Chemical functionalization may also require careful optimization to ensure that the modified surface retains the desired optical and mechanical properties while enhancing its functionality for specific applications [18]. Additionally, some surface modifications can be difficult to apply uniformly across large or complex PDMS structures, leading to variability in performance and reliability.

Moreover, the use of PDMS in medical imaging systems can be constrained by its mechanical limitations. While PDMS is highly flexible and elastic, it has relatively low tensile strength and can deform under prolonged stress. This can be a concern in applications where PDMS is used as a component in imaging devices that require structural stability, such as flexible endoscopes or wearable imaging sensors. In such cases, the mechanical properties of PDMS may need to be enhanced through the incorporation of reinforcing materials or the development of composite structures [18].

Another challenge associated with PDMS in medical imaging is its compatibility with advanced imaging technologies. While PDMS is well-suited for optical imaging due to its transparency, it may not perform as well in other imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). The material's low density and lack of magnetic properties can make it difficult to use in MRI applications, and its low X-ray attenuation can limit its effectiveness in CT scans [18]. This necessitates the development of alternative materials or the integration of PDMS with other components to enhance its compatibility with a wider range of imaging systems.

In addition to these technical challenges, there are also practical considerations that limit the use of PDMS in medical imaging. For example, the sterilization of PDMS-based imaging devices can be a complex process, as certain sterilization methods can degrade the material's properties. This is a critical concern in clinical settings, where sterility is essential for patient safety. The need for specialized sterilization protocols can increase the cost and complexity of using PDMS in medical imaging applications [18].

Finally, the integration of PDMS with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in medical imaging presents additional challenges. While AI and ML have the potential to enhance the performance of imaging systems, they require high-quality and consistent data inputs. The variability in PDMS properties and the potential for surface contamination can introduce noise and inconsistencies into the data, which can affect the accuracy of AI-driven imaging algorithms [18]. Addressing these issues requires careful material selection, surface modification, and data preprocessing to ensure that PDMS-based imaging systems can effectively leverage the power of AI and ML.

In summary, while PDMS is a valuable material in biomedical engineering, its application in medical imaging faces several challenges and limitations. These include limited optical stability, potential for contamination, the need for surface modifications, mechanical constraints, compatibility issues with advanced imaging technologies, and challenges in sterilization and integration with emerging technologies. Addressing these limitations will require further research and innovation to optimize the use of PDMS in medical imaging applications.

## 8 Challenges and Limitations of PDMS in Biomedical Applications

### 8.1 Mechanical Stability and Durability of PDMS

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is widely used in biomedical engineering due to its excellent biocompatibility, flexibility, and transparency. However, one of the major challenges in its application is its mechanical stability and durability, which can limit its performance in dynamic biomedical environments. PDMS exhibits relatively low tensile strength compared to other engineering polymers, which makes it prone to deformation under prolonged stress. This mechanical limitation is particularly critical in applications where PDMS is used as a structural component, such as in microfluidic devices, implantable devices, and tissue engineering scaffolds. The low mechanical strength of PDMS can lead to structural failure, reducing the longevity and reliability of biomedical devices that rely on its properties [45].

One of the key factors affecting the mechanical stability of PDMS is its viscoelastic nature. PDMS exhibits time-dependent deformation, which means that it can undergo permanent deformation when subjected to prolonged stress. This behavior is attributed to its molecular structure, which consists of long, flexible chains of siloxane units that can slide past each other under stress. As a result, PDMS can exhibit creep, where it gradually deforms over time under a constant load. This property can be problematic in applications that require long-term mechanical stability, such as in implantable devices or in microfluidic systems where precise fluid control is essential. The susceptibility of PDMS to deformation under prolonged stress has been well-documented in several studies, which highlight the need for careful design and material selection in biomedical applications [45].

In dynamic biomedical environments, such as those involving repeated mechanical stress or exposure to biological fluids, the durability of PDMS becomes a critical concern. PDMS is known to undergo changes in its mechanical properties when exposed to various environmental factors, including temperature fluctuations, humidity, and chemical exposure. For example, prolonged exposure to certain solvents can cause PDMS to swell or degrade, leading to a loss of mechanical integrity. Additionally, the presence of biological fluids, such as blood or interstitial fluid, can lead to the accumulation of proteins or other biological molecules on the surface of PDMS, which can affect its mechanical performance and lead to fouling or contamination. These challenges are particularly relevant in applications such as implantable sensors or microfluidic devices that are in direct contact with biological systems [81].

Another important limitation of PDMS in terms of mechanical stability is its low hardness and resistance to wear. PDMS is a soft and flexible material, which makes it ideal for applications that require conformability and adaptability. However, this same property can be a disadvantage in applications where mechanical wear and abrasion are a concern. For instance, in applications involving repeated contact with other materials, such as in soft robotic systems or wearable health monitoring devices, the soft nature of PDMS can lead to premature wear and failure. The low wear resistance of PDMS has been observed in several studies, which highlight the need for surface modifications or composite formulations to improve its mechanical performance in such applications [82].

The challenges associated with the mechanical stability and durability of PDMS have led to significant research efforts aimed at improving its mechanical properties. One approach involves the development of composite materials that combine PDMS with other materials to enhance its mechanical performance. For example, the addition of fillers such as silica nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes can significantly improve the tensile strength and stiffness of PDMS without compromising its flexibility [83]. These composite materials are particularly useful in applications that require a balance between mechanical strength and flexibility, such as in microfluidic devices or tissue engineering scaffolds.

Another strategy to improve the mechanical stability of PDMS is through surface modification techniques. Surface treatments such as plasma etching, UV ozone treatment, or chemical functionalization can alter the surface properties of PDMS to improve its adhesion, reduce fouling, and enhance its mechanical performance. These modifications can also help to prevent the accumulation of biological molecules on the surface of PDMS, which can otherwise lead to degradation of its mechanical properties over time [84]. In addition, the use of crosslinking agents can further enhance the mechanical strength of PDMS by increasing the degree of crosslinking between its polymer chains.

Despite these advances, the mechanical stability and durability of PDMS remain significant challenges in its application for biomedical devices. The inherent limitations of PDMS, such as its low tensile strength, susceptibility to deformation, and poor wear resistance, necessitate the development of alternative materials or the integration of PDMS with other materials to achieve the desired mechanical performance. Ongoing research in the field of biomaterials is focused on addressing these challenges and developing new materials that combine the desirable properties of PDMS with improved mechanical stability and durability [14].

In summary, while PDMS is a versatile and widely used material in biomedical engineering, its mechanical stability and durability present significant challenges that must be addressed. The low tensile strength, susceptibility to deformation, and poor wear resistance of PDMS limit its performance in dynamic biomedical environments. However, through the development of composite materials, surface modifications, and advanced fabrication techniques, researchers are working to overcome these limitations and expand the potential applications of PDMS in biomedical engineering. The ongoing efforts to improve the mechanical properties of PDMS will play a crucial role in its future use for a wide range of biomedical applications.

### 8.2 Biocompatibility Over Long-Term Use

[11]  
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is widely recognized for its biocompatibility and has been extensively used in biomedical applications, including implantable devices, microfluidic systems, and tissue engineering scaffolds. However, the long-term biocompatibility of PDMS remains a critical concern, particularly when the material is exposed to biological environments for extended periods. While PDMS is known for its inertness and low reactivity, the potential for degradation and the associated release of degradation products, along with the body's immune responses to prolonged exposure, must be carefully evaluated. These factors collectively influence the material’s suitability for long-term biomedical applications and necessitate a thorough examination of its biocompatibility over extended durations [49].

One of the primary concerns regarding the long-term biocompatibility of PDMS is its degradation over time. PDMS is a silicon-based polymer, and although it is inherently stable, it can undergo hydrolytic degradation when exposed to water or biological fluids. This degradation process can lead to the formation of silanol groups and other byproducts, which may potentially interact with surrounding tissues [49]. The degradation products of PDMS are generally considered non-toxic, but their long-term effects on biological systems are not fully understood. For instance, studies have shown that PDMS can release trace amounts of low-molecular-weight siloxanes, which may accumulate in the body over time and potentially cause cellular stress or inflammation [49]. This concern is particularly relevant for applications involving implantable devices, where PDMS is in continuous contact with bodily fluids and tissues.

The immune response to PDMS is another key aspect of its long-term biocompatibility. While PDMS is generally considered biocompatible, the presence of the material in the body can trigger immune responses, including the formation of a fibrous capsule around the implant [49]. This foreign body reaction is a common issue with many implantable materials and can lead to complications such as inflammation, tissue necrosis, or reduced device functionality. Research has shown that the surface chemistry of PDMS plays a crucial role in modulating the immune response [49]. For example, surface modifications such as plasma treatment or chemical functionalization can enhance biocompatibility by reducing the adhesion of immune cells and proteins to the material [49]. However, the long-term stability of these modifications remains a challenge, as the surface properties of PDMS can change over time due to environmental exposure and mechanical stress [49].

Prolonged exposure to biological fluids and tissues can also affect the mechanical and chemical properties of PDMS, which in turn may influence its biocompatibility. For instance, the mechanical stability of PDMS can decrease over time due to hydrolytic degradation, leading to a loss of structural integrity [49]. This degradation can be exacerbated by the presence of enzymes and other biological molecules that may catalyze the breakdown of the polymer. Additionally, the interaction of PDMS with biological fluids can lead to the adsorption of proteins and other biomolecules on its surface, which can further influence the material’s biocompatibility [49]. The adsorption of proteins can either enhance or hinder biocompatibility, depending on the nature of the proteins and their interactions with the surrounding tissues. For example, the adsorption of fibronectin and other extracellular matrix proteins can promote cell adhesion and tissue integration, whereas the adsorption of inflammatory cytokines can lead to adverse immune responses [49].

Another factor that affects the long-term biocompatibility of PDMS is its interaction with cells and tissues. While PDMS is generally non-toxic and does not induce significant cell death, its long-term effects on cellular behavior are not fully understood. Studies have shown that PDMS can support cell adhesion and proliferation in short-term cultures, but the long-term effects on cell viability and function remain a subject of investigation [49]. The presence of PDMS in the body can also influence the behavior of immune cells, such as macrophages and lymphocytes, which play a critical role in the immune response to foreign materials [49]. For example, prolonged exposure to PDMS can lead to the activation of macrophages, which may result in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the formation of a fibrous capsule around the implant [49].

The long-term biocompatibility of PDMS is also influenced by its interaction with other materials and the environment in which it is used. In multi-material systems, such as those found in complex biomedical devices, the compatibility of PDMS with other components is essential for ensuring long-term stability and performance [49]. For instance, the use of PDMS in combination with metals or ceramics can lead to the formation of interfacial reactions that may affect the material’s biocompatibility over time [49]. Additionally, the presence of other materials can influence the degradation behavior of PDMS, either by accelerating or inhibiting the hydrolytic process [49].

In addition to the physical and chemical factors affecting the long-term biocompatibility of PDMS, the design and application of PDMS-based devices also play a critical role. The mechanical properties of PDMS, such as its elasticity and flexibility, are advantageous for certain applications, but they can also lead to mechanical stress on surrounding tissues, particularly in long-term implantable devices [49]. This mechanical stress can contribute to tissue damage and the formation of fibrous capsules, which can compromise the functionality of the device over time [49]. Therefore, the design of PDMS-based devices must consider the mechanical interactions between the material and the surrounding tissues to ensure long-term biocompatibility and performance.

In conclusion, the long-term biocompatibility of PDMS is a complex issue that involves multiple factors, including degradation, immune responses, and interactions with biological systems. While PDMS is generally considered biocompatible, its long-term effects on the body are not fully understood, and further research is needed to address these concerns. The development of advanced surface modifications, the integration of PDMS with other materials, and the optimization of device design are all critical steps in ensuring the long-term biocompatibility of PDMS in biomedical applications [49]. As the use of PDMS continues to expand in biomedical engineering, a comprehensive understanding of its long-term behavior and its interactions with biological systems will be essential for the safe and effective development of PDMS-based technologies.

### 8.3 Surface Modification Requirements

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a widely used material in biomedical engineering due to its favorable properties such as biocompatibility, elasticity, and optical transparency. However, PDMS exhibits several surface-related limitations that hinder its direct application in certain biomedical contexts. One of the primary challenges is its inherently low surface energy, which results in poor adhesion of biological cells, proteins, and other functional components. This limitation necessitates surface modification to enhance PDMS's functionality, improve its compatibility with biological systems, and ensure long-term performance in medical devices. Surface modification techniques play a critical role in enabling PDMS to meet the diverse requirements of biomedical applications, including enhanced adhesion, reduced fouling, and specific biochemical interactions. The necessity of surface modification for PDMS has been well documented in the literature, with various studies highlighting the importance of these modifications in optimizing its performance for a wide range of biomedical uses [2; 47].

The low surface energy of PDMS is a significant factor that limits its utility in biomedical applications. This property makes PDMS inherently hydrophobic and resistant to wetting, which is problematic for applications requiring uniform cell adhesion or the integration of biological components. For instance, in tissue engineering, the ability of PDMS to support cell adhesion and growth is essential for creating functional 3D cell culture models. However, without surface modification, PDMS surfaces often fail to promote cell attachment, leading to poor cell viability and functionality. Studies have shown that surface treatments such as plasma treatment, UV ozone exposure, and chemical functionalization can significantly enhance the hydrophilicity of PDMS, thereby improving its ability to support cell adhesion and proliferation [47]. These modifications are particularly important in the context of organ-on-a-chip systems, where the ability of PDMS to maintain stable cell cultures is crucial for accurate biological modeling.

In addition to improving adhesion, surface modification of PDMS is also necessary to reduce fouling and prevent non-specific interactions with biological molecules. Fouling, or the unwanted accumulation of biomolecules on the surface of a material, can interfere with the performance of biosensors, microfluidic devices, and other biomedical systems. For example, in drug delivery applications, the surface of PDMS-based devices can become coated with proteins and other biomolecules, which may alter the release kinetics of the drug or interfere with the function of the device. Surface modification techniques such as the use of hydrophilic coatings, zwitterionic polymers, or anti-fouling agents can help mitigate these issues by reducing the tendency of PDMS to interact with non-target biomolecules [47]. These approaches are particularly relevant in the development of implantable devices, where the prevention of bacterial colonization and protein adsorption is critical for ensuring long-term device functionality and patient safety.

Another critical aspect of surface modification for PDMS is the ability to enable specific biochemical interactions. In many biomedical applications, the surface of PDMS needs to be functionalized with specific ligands, antibodies, or other bioactive molecules to facilitate targeted interactions with biological systems. For example, in biosensor applications, the surface of PDMS is often modified with receptors or enzymes that can bind to specific analytes, such as glucose or other metabolites. These modifications are essential for ensuring the sensitivity and selectivity of the biosensor. Studies have shown that surface functionalization techniques such as silanization, grafting of functional groups, and immobilization of biomolecules can effectively enhance the bioactivity of PDMS surfaces [47]. These techniques are widely used in the development of microfluidic biosensors, where the ability to detect specific biomarkers with high accuracy is critical for applications such as disease diagnosis and personalized medicine.

The necessity of surface modification for PDMS is further underscored by the challenges associated with long-term biocompatibility and stability. While PDMS is generally considered biocompatible, its long-term performance in the body can be affected by factors such as hydrolytic degradation, mechanical fatigue, and the accumulation of degradation products. These factors can compromise the integrity of PDMS-based devices and lead to adverse biological responses. Surface modifications can help mitigate these issues by enhancing the mechanical stability of PDMS and reducing its susceptibility to degradation. For example, the use of cross-linking agents, protective coatings, or hybrid materials can significantly improve the durability of PDMS in biomedical applications [47]. These modifications are particularly important for applications such as implantable sensors and drug delivery devices, where long-term performance and reliability are essential.

In conclusion, the necessity of surface modification for PDMS is evident in its role in overcoming the limitations of the material and enhancing its functionality for a wide range of biomedical applications. Surface modifications are essential for improving adhesion, reducing fouling, and enabling specific biochemical interactions, which are critical for the success of PDMS-based devices in biomedical contexts. The use of techniques such as plasma treatment, chemical functionalization, and hydrophilic coatings has been shown to significantly enhance the performance of PDMS, making it more suitable for applications in tissue engineering, microfluidics, biosensing, and drug delivery. As the demand for advanced biomedical devices continues to grow, the development of novel surface modification strategies will play a crucial role in expanding the potential of PDMS in biomedical engineering.

### 8.4 Limitations in High-Load Applications

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a widely used material in biomedical engineering due to its remarkable properties, such as biocompatibility, transparency, and flexibility. Despite these advantages, PDMS has certain limitations when it comes to high-load applications. One of the primary challenges in using PDMS for biomedical devices subjected to high mechanical stress is its relatively low tensile strength and poor resistance to deformation under prolonged mechanical loads. This limitation restricts its use in applications that require the material to withstand significant mechanical forces without failing or deforming, such as in load-bearing implants or in devices that experience repeated mechanical stress.

The mechanical properties of PDMS are inherently different from those of more rigid biomaterials like metals or ceramics. PDMS is a hyperelastic material, which means it can undergo large deformations without permanent damage. However, this property also makes it susceptible to mechanical failure under high-stress conditions. The elongation at break for PDMS is typically in the range of 100-300%, which is much higher than that of many conventional polymers. However, this elasticity comes at the cost of mechanical strength. PDMS has a Young's modulus in the range of 0.1-1 MPa, which is significantly lower than that of materials like silicone rubber, which can have a Young's modulus of 1-10 MPa. This lower modulus makes PDMS less suitable for applications where mechanical stability and rigidity are required.

The inability of PDMS to withstand significant mechanical forces without deformation or failure is a critical limitation in high-load biomedical applications. For instance, in the context of load-bearing implants or prosthetic devices, materials must maintain their structural integrity over long periods and under repeated mechanical stress. PDMS, with its relatively low mechanical strength, may not be the best choice for such applications. This limitation is particularly relevant in the development of implantable devices that are subjected to continuous mechanical stress, such as orthopedic implants or cardiovascular stents. In such cases, the material may deform or fail over time, leading to potential complications and the need for revision surgeries [2].

In addition to its mechanical limitations, PDMS also faces challenges in terms of durability and long-term performance in high-load applications. The long-term biocompatibility and stability of PDMS in vivo are important considerations for biomedical devices. While PDMS is generally considered biocompatible, its performance under prolonged mechanical stress may lead to microcracks or other forms of degradation that could compromise its functionality. This is a critical issue, especially in applications where the material is expected to function reliably over extended periods. Studies have shown that the mechanical degradation of PDMS under cyclic loading can lead to the formation of microcracks, which can act as initiation points for further degradation [2].

Moreover, the use of PDMS in high-load applications is also limited by its poor adhesion properties. PDMS has a low surface energy, which makes it challenging to bond with other materials. This can be a significant drawback in applications where the material needs to be securely attached to other components or substrates. The low surface energy of PDMS also makes it difficult to functionalize the surface for specific biomedical applications. Surface modification techniques, such as plasma treatment or chemical functionalization, are often required to improve the adhesion and compatibility of PDMS with other materials. However, these modifications can add complexity and cost to the fabrication process [2].

Another limitation of PDMS in high-load applications is its sensitivity to environmental factors. PDMS can be affected by changes in temperature, humidity, and exposure to certain chemicals. These environmental factors can alter the mechanical properties of PDMS, making it less suitable for applications that require consistent performance under varying conditions. For example, in the context of in vivo applications, the mechanical properties of PDMS may be affected by the physiological environment, leading to changes in its behavior over time. This can be a significant issue in applications where the material is expected to function reliably in a dynamic biological environment [2].

The limitations of PDMS in high-load applications are also influenced by the challenges associated with its fabrication and processing. The soft lithography techniques used to fabricate PDMS-based devices require careful control of the curing process and the use of appropriate molds to achieve the desired mechanical properties. Any deviations in the fabrication process can lead to variations in the mechanical performance of the final product. Additionally, the scalability of PDMS fabrication techniques for large-scale production is a significant challenge, which can limit its use in high-load applications that require consistent and reliable performance [2].

In summary, while PDMS offers many advantages for biomedical applications, its limitations in high-load applications are significant. The low mechanical strength, poor resistance to deformation, and challenges in long-term durability make it less suitable for applications that require the material to withstand significant mechanical forces. These limitations highlight the need for alternative materials or the development of PDMS-based composites that can enhance its mechanical properties while retaining its biocompatibility and flexibility. Further research and innovation are needed to address these challenges and expand the range of applications for PDMS in biomedical engineering [2].

### 8.5 Challenges in Sterilization and Reuse

The sterilization and reuse of PDMS-based biomedical devices present significant challenges, particularly in clinical settings where maintaining sterility is critical. PDMS, while highly versatile and biocompatible, is a silicone-based polymer with unique properties that complicate sterilization processes. Unlike traditional materials such as metals or certain plastics, PDMS is highly sensitive to sterilization methods that involve high temperatures, radiation, or chemical exposure, which can degrade its mechanical and chemical properties. This sensitivity necessitates careful selection of sterilization techniques that preserve the integrity and functionality of PDMS devices while ensuring they are free from contaminants and pathogens [49]. 

One of the primary challenges in sterilizing PDMS-based devices is the risk of material degradation. For instance, autoclaving, which is a common sterilization method, involves exposure to high-pressure steam at temperatures exceeding 121°C. This process can cause irreversible damage to PDMS, leading to a loss of elasticity, increased brittleness, and changes in surface characteristics. Such degradation can compromise the performance of PDMS-based devices, such as microfluidic systems or biosensors, which rely on precise mechanical and surface properties for optimal function [22]. Similarly, gamma radiation, another common sterilization method, can induce cross-linking or chain scission in PDMS, altering its mechanical behavior and reducing its longevity. This is particularly problematic for devices that are intended for long-term use, such as implantable sensors or drug delivery systems [22].

In addition to material degradation, the chemical inertness of PDMS can pose challenges during sterilization. PDMS is known for its low surface energy and resistance to many common sterilizing agents, which can limit the effectiveness of chemical sterilization methods. For example, ethylene oxide (ETO), a widely used gas for sterilizing heat-sensitive materials, may not penetrate PDMS uniformly due to its hydrophobic nature. This can result in incomplete sterilization, leaving residual ETO molecules that may leach out over time and pose a risk to patient safety [49]. Moreover, the use of liquid chemical sterilants, such as hydrogen peroxide or peracetic acid, may not effectively penetrate PDMS structures, especially those with complex geometries or microfluidic features, leading to potential microbial contamination [49].

The limitations in reusing PDMS-based devices further exacerbate the challenges associated with sterilization. Unlike single-use devices, which are discarded after a single patient interaction, reusable devices require multiple cycles of sterilization, each of which may introduce cumulative damage to the PDMS material. This is particularly relevant for devices such as microfluidic chips, which are often used in high-throughput screening or diagnostic applications and are expected to undergo repeated sterilization. However, the repeated exposure to sterilization agents can lead to progressive material degradation, making it increasingly difficult to maintain the device's performance and reliability over time [49]. Additionally, the presence of biological contaminants, such as proteins or cells, can adhere to PDMS surfaces and resist removal even after thorough cleaning, increasing the risk of cross-contamination between patients [49].

The issue of reusability is further complicated by the need to maintain the biocompatibility of PDMS-based devices. While PDMS is inherently biocompatible, the sterilization process can introduce new surface modifications or chemical residues that may alter its interaction with biological tissues or fluids. For example, the use of plasma sterilization, which is a common method for surface sterilization, can modify the surface chemistry of PDMS, potentially affecting its hydrophilicity and adhesion properties. This can have significant implications for applications such as tissue engineering scaffolds or cell culture platforms, where the surface properties of the material are crucial for cell behavior and tissue formation [49]. Furthermore, the introduction of new surface functionalities during sterilization may require additional testing to ensure that they do not adversely affect the biocompatibility or performance of the device [49].

Another challenge in the sterilization and reuse of PDMS-based devices is the variability in device design and material composition. PDMS can be modified with various additives or coatings to enhance its properties for specific applications, such as improving surface adhesion or introducing functional groups for biomolecular interactions. However, these modifications can affect the material's response to sterilization methods. For instance, the presence of hydrophilic coatings on PDMS may increase its susceptibility to degradation during gamma radiation, as these coatings can interact with the radiation and lead to more pronounced changes in the material's properties [49]. Similarly, the incorporation of nanoparticles or other composite materials into PDMS can alter its thermal and mechanical behavior during sterilization, necessitating the development of tailored sterilization protocols for different device configurations [49].

Finally, the complexity of PDMS-based devices, particularly those with intricate microfluidic or electronic components, presents additional challenges in sterilization and reuse. These devices often require careful handling and specialized equipment to ensure that sterilization is effective without damaging the sensitive components. For example, microfluidic devices with embedded sensors or electrodes may be susceptible to electrical or mechanical failure if exposed to certain sterilization methods. This necessitates the development of sterilization strategies that are compatible with the device's design and functionality, which can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process [49]. In addition, the integration of PDMS with other materials, such as metals or ceramics, can introduce additional challenges in sterilization due to differences in thermal and chemical resistance, requiring further optimization of sterilization protocols [49]. 

Overall, the sterilization and reuse of PDMS-based biomedical devices remain significant challenges due to the material's sensitivity to sterilization methods, the risk of material degradation, and the complexities of device design. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach that involves the development of novel sterilization techniques, the optimization of device materials and configurations, and the implementation of rigorous quality control measures to ensure the safety and reliability of PDMS-based devices in clinical settings [49].

### 8.6 Environmental and Chemical Sensitivity

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is widely recognized for its biocompatibility, flexibility, and ease of fabrication, which have made it a popular material in biomedical engineering. However, its environmental and chemical sensitivity pose significant challenges that can affect its performance and longevity in various biomedical applications. PDMS is susceptible to degradation and changes in its physical and mechanical properties when exposed to solvents, temperature fluctuations, and ultraviolet (UV) light. These factors can compromise its structural integrity, leading to reduced effectiveness in biomedical devices and systems. Understanding and addressing these environmental and chemical sensitivities is crucial for the reliable and long-term use of PDMS in biomedical applications.

One of the primary environmental sensitivities of PDMS is its susceptibility to solvents. PDMS is a silicone-based polymer that exhibits high hydrophobicity and chemical inertness, which make it resistant to many organic solvents. However, certain solvents, such as alcohols, ethers, and esters, can cause swelling or partial dissolution of PDMS, altering its physical properties and potentially affecting its performance in biomedical devices. For instance, exposure to ethanol, a commonly used disinfectant, can lead to the softening of PDMS, which may compromise its structural stability in microfluidic devices and other applications that require precise mechanical properties [2]. The chemical interactions between PDMS and solvents can be further influenced by the specific formulation of PDMS, including the presence of cross-linking agents and fillers. Therefore, it is essential to select appropriate solvents and ensure their compatibility with PDMS in biomedical applications.

Another critical factor that affects the performance of PDMS is its sensitivity to temperature fluctuations. PDMS has a relatively low glass transition temperature (Tg), which means that it can undergo significant changes in its mechanical properties when exposed to varying temperatures. At temperatures below the Tg, PDMS becomes rigid and brittle, while at temperatures above the Tg, it becomes more flexible and elastomeric. These transitions can impact the functionality of PDMS-based devices, particularly in applications that require consistent mechanical behavior. For example, in microfluidic systems, temperature variations can cause changes in the viscosity of fluids, leading to unpredictable flow dynamics and potential failures in the device [4]. Additionally, in vivo applications, where PDMS is exposed to the body's physiological temperatures, the material's response to temperature changes must be carefully considered to ensure long-term stability and performance.

In addition to temperature and solvents, PDMS is also sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) exposure, which can lead to degradation and loss of mechanical properties. UV radiation can induce photochemical reactions in PDMS, causing chain scission and cross-linking, which can alter the material's physical characteristics. This sensitivity to UV light is particularly relevant in biomedical applications where PDMS may be exposed to light sources, such as during imaging or therapeutic procedures. For instance, in optical coherence tomography (OCT) systems, where PDMS is used as a component of the imaging setup, exposure to UV light can affect the material's optical transparency and structural integrity [18]. To mitigate the effects of UV exposure, it is often necessary to incorporate UV stabilizers or protective coatings into PDMS-based devices, which can add complexity and cost to the fabrication process.

The environmental and chemical sensitivity of PDMS can also be influenced by its interaction with biological environments. In vivo applications, where PDMS is exposed to biological fluids and tissues, can lead to changes in the material's surface properties and mechanical behavior. For example, the presence of proteins and other biomolecules in the extracellular environment can cause adsorption onto the PDMS surface, potentially affecting its biocompatibility and performance [17]. Additionally, the hydrolytic stability of PDMS can be compromised in the presence of enzymes and other biological factors, leading to degradation over time. This degradation can be particularly problematic in long-term implantable devices, where the material's stability is crucial for maintaining functionality and minimizing the risk of adverse reactions.

The challenges associated with the environmental and chemical sensitivity of PDMS highlight the need for further research and development to enhance its performance in biomedical applications. One approach to addressing these challenges is the modification of PDMS to improve its resistance to solvents, temperature fluctuations, and UV exposure. Surface modification techniques, such as plasma treatment and chemical functionalization, can be used to alter the surface properties of PDMS, making it more resistant to environmental and chemical factors [9]. Additionally, the development of composite materials that incorporate PDMS with other polymers or nanoparticles can enhance its mechanical and chemical stability while maintaining its desirable properties. For example, the integration of PDMS with carbon nanotubes or graphene can improve its thermal and electrical conductivity, making it more suitable for applications that require enhanced performance under challenging conditions [55].

In summary, the environmental and chemical sensitivity of PDMS presents several challenges that can affect its performance and longevity in biomedical applications. The susceptibility of PDMS to solvents, temperature fluctuations, and UV exposure, as well as its interactions with biological environments, must be carefully considered to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of PDMS-based devices. By understanding these sensitivities and exploring strategies to enhance the material's stability and performance, researchers can continue to leverage the unique properties of PDMS in the development of advanced biomedical technologies [2; 18; 17].

### 8.7 Integration with Advanced Technologies

The integration of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), nanotechnology, and microfabrication presents both opportunities and significant challenges in the biomedical engineering field. While PDMS is widely utilized for its flexibility, biocompatibility, and ease of fabrication, its integration with these advanced technologies is not always straightforward. Compatibility issues, scalability limitations, and the need for tailored modifications are among the key challenges that must be addressed to fully realize the potential of PDMS in next-generation biomedical applications.

One of the most promising areas of integration is the combination of PDMS with AI. AI, particularly deep learning and machine learning, has shown remarkable potential in improving the performance of biomedical devices and systems. However, the integration of PDMS-based devices with AI algorithms requires careful consideration of material properties and device functionalities. For instance, PDMS is often used in flexible biosensors, where it serves as a substrate for embedding sensors and electronics. However, the integration of AI algorithms into such systems necessitates the development of robust data acquisition and processing pipelines, which can be complicated by the physical characteristics of PDMS [19]. Moreover, the inherent variability in PDMS-based sensor outputs due to material imperfections and environmental factors can pose challenges for AI model training and generalization.

Another area of integration is with nanotechnology. PDMS is frequently used as a matrix for embedding nanoparticles, such as magnetic nanoparticles, to create functional materials with unique properties. For example, in the context of microfluidics, magnetic nanoparticles embedded in PDMS can be used to manipulate and isolate circulating tumor cells (CTCs) [2]. However, the integration of nanomaterials into PDMS requires precise control over nanoparticle distribution and surface chemistry, which can be difficult to achieve at scale. Additionally, the long-term stability and biocompatibility of nanomaterials within PDMS need to be carefully evaluated to ensure the safety and efficacy of the resulting devices. The challenges of nanoscale integration highlight the need for advanced fabrication techniques and careful material characterization.

Microfabrication is another area where PDMS integration presents challenges. PDMS is a popular material in soft lithography, which is a key fabrication technique for creating microfluidic devices and lab-on-a-chip systems. However, the integration of PDMS with microfabrication processes, such as photolithography and etching, requires careful optimization to achieve the desired device performance. The low surface energy of PDMS can lead to issues with adhesion and patterning, necessitating surface modifications such as plasma treatment or chemical functionalization [9]. Additionally, the mechanical properties of PDMS, such as its low tensile strength and susceptibility to deformation, can limit its use in high-stress or high-precision microfabrication applications. These limitations highlight the need for alternative materials or hybrid approaches that combine PDMS with other polymers or substrates to enhance mechanical stability.

The integration of PDMS with AI, nanotechnology, and microfabrication also raises important scalability issues. While small-scale prototypes and laboratory demonstrations have shown promising results, scaling up these technologies for commercial and clinical applications presents significant challenges. For example, the use of PDMS-based microfluidic systems for high-throughput drug screening requires the fabrication of large-scale, complex devices with high reproducibility and reliability. However, the fabrication of such devices is often time-consuming and costly, and the integration of AI algorithms into these systems can further complicate the design and optimization process. Similarly, the use of PDMS in wearable health monitoring systems requires the development of scalable manufacturing processes that can produce large quantities of devices with consistent quality [8].

In addition to these technical challenges, the integration of PDMS with advanced technologies also requires addressing compatibility issues between different components. For instance, PDMS-based sensors and actuators must be compatible with the electronic components and software systems that they interact with. This requires the development of standardized interfaces and protocols that can facilitate seamless integration. Furthermore, the integration of PDMS with AI algorithms necessitates the development of robust data processing and communication frameworks that can handle the large volumes of data generated by these systems [19].

Despite these challenges, there are significant opportunities for advancing the integration of PDMS with advanced technologies. For example, the use of PDMS in combination with AI can lead to the development of intelligent biomedical devices that can adapt to changing conditions and provide real-time feedback. Similarly, the integration of PDMS with nanotechnology can enable the creation of smart materials with enhanced functionalities, such as targeted drug delivery and real-time monitoring. Moreover, the use of PDMS in microfabrication can lead to the development of compact, high-performance devices that can be used in a wide range of biomedical applications.

In conclusion, while the integration of PDMS with advanced technologies such as AI, nanotechnology, and microfabrication offers exciting possibilities, it also presents significant challenges that must be addressed. These challenges include compatibility issues, scalability limitations, and the need for tailored modifications to ensure the safety, efficacy, and reliability of the resulting devices. By overcoming these challenges, researchers can unlock the full potential of PDMS in the development of next-generation biomedical technologies.

### 8.8 Limitations in Precise Control and Sensing

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is widely utilized in biomedical applications due to its unique combination of properties, such as biocompatibility, flexibility, and ease of fabrication. However, despite its widespread use, PDMS presents several limitations in achieving precise control and sensing, particularly in applications that demand high sensitivity and accuracy, such as microfluidic systems and biosensors [2]. These limitations stem from the inherent physical and mechanical characteristics of PDMS, as well as its interaction with other materials and external stimuli. Understanding these constraints is essential for optimizing PDMS-based systems and improving their performance in critical biomedical applications.

One of the primary challenges in using PDMS for precise control and sensing is its viscoelastic behavior, which can introduce delays and hysteresis in dynamic systems. PDMS exhibits time-dependent deformation under mechanical stress, leading to inaccuracies in force or pressure measurements. This property is particularly problematic in microfluidic systems where precise fluid flow control is crucial for reliable sample handling and analysis [4]. For instance, in microfluidic platforms designed for single-cell analysis, the viscoelasticity of PDMS can cause variations in flow rates and droplet formation, affecting the reproducibility of experiments. Similarly, in biosensing applications, the viscoelastic response of PDMS can hinder the accurate detection of small changes in biological signals, reducing the sensitivity of the system [17].

Another limitation is the low surface energy of PDMS, which affects its wettability and adhesion properties. While this characteristic is advantageous in certain applications, such as preventing unwanted cell adhesion, it can be a disadvantage in systems requiring reliable fluidic connections or precise sensor integration [9]. For example, in microfluidic devices where fluid channels must maintain a consistent flow, the low surface energy of PDMS can lead to issues such as air bubble entrapment and inconsistent fluid movement, which can compromise the accuracy of the device. Furthermore, in biosensing applications, the poor adhesion of PDMS to other materials can result in unstable sensor interfaces, leading to signal drift and reduced reliability [17].

The lack of intrinsic electrical conductivity in PDMS poses another challenge for precise control and sensing, especially in applications that require real-time monitoring of electrical signals. While PDMS can be modified to incorporate conductive materials, such as carbon nanotubes or graphene, these modifications often introduce complexities in fabrication and may alter the mechanical properties of the material [55]. In biosensing systems, where electrical signals are critical for detecting biomarkers or physiological changes, the absence of inherent conductivity in PDMS can limit the sensitivity and responsiveness of the sensor. For instance, in flexible biosensors designed to monitor heart rate or muscle activity, the low conductivity of PDMS can result in delayed or inaccurate signal transmission, reducing the effectiveness of the device [6].

Additionally, the mechanical properties of PDMS can limit its ability to provide precise control in applications that involve complex geometries or dynamic environments. PDMS is known for its high elasticity and low tensile strength, which make it suitable for applications requiring flexibility, but these properties can also lead to structural instabilities under prolonged or repeated mechanical stress. In microfluidic systems, for example, the elastic deformation of PDMS can cause changes in channel dimensions, affecting fluid flow and measurement accuracy. Similarly, in soft robotics, where precise actuation is essential, the viscoelastic nature of PDMS can result in reduced force output and slower response times, limiting the performance of the robotic system [59].

Another significant limitation is the difficulty in achieving uniform thickness and surface smoothness in PDMS-based devices, which can impact the precision of control and sensing mechanisms. The fabrication of PDMS structures often involves molding techniques that can introduce variations in thickness and surface texture, leading to inconsistencies in device performance. In microfluidic systems, these variations can cause irregularities in fluid flow and reduced accuracy in sample analysis. In biosensing applications, surface roughness can affect the adhesion and distribution of biomolecules, leading to unreliable sensor readings [41]. Furthermore, the use of PDMS in devices with complex three-dimensional geometries can exacerbate these issues, as achieving precise control over the material's properties during fabrication becomes increasingly challenging [14].

The interaction of PDMS with other materials, such as metals, polymers, and biological tissues, can also introduce limitations in precise control and sensing. While PDMS is biocompatible and chemically inert, its interaction with other materials can lead to issues such as delamination, corrosion, or unintended chemical reactions. In microfluidic systems that incorporate metallic components, for example, the low surface energy of PDMS can result in poor adhesion between the PDMS and the metal, leading to leaks or structural failures. In biosensing applications, the interaction of PDMS with biological tissues can affect the accuracy of measurements, as the material may interfere with the detection of specific biomarkers [17].

Moreover, the long-term stability of PDMS in biomedical applications can be compromised by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and exposure to biological fluids. These factors can cause changes in the mechanical and chemical properties of PDMS, leading to degradation over time. In applications that require long-term monitoring, such as implantable sensors or drug delivery systems, this degradation can affect the reliability and accuracy of the device. For instance, prolonged exposure to bodily fluids can cause changes in the surface properties of PDMS, leading to reduced adhesion and altered sensing performance [54].

In summary, while PDMS is a versatile material with many advantages in biomedical applications, its limitations in achieving precise control and sensing cannot be overlooked. The viscoelastic behavior, low surface energy, lack of intrinsic conductivity, mechanical instability, and challenges in fabrication and long-term stability all contribute to these limitations. Addressing these challenges requires further research and innovation in material modifications, fabrication techniques, and sensor design to enhance the performance of PDMS-based systems in applications that demand high sensitivity and accuracy [17].
