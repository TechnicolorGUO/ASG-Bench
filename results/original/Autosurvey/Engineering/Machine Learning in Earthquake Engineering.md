## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Importance of Earthquake Engineering

Earthquake engineering is a critical discipline within civil engineering that focuses on the design, construction, and maintenance of structures capable of withstanding seismic events. The significance of this field lies in its direct impact on public safety, infrastructure resilience, and the mitigation of the devastating effects of earthquakes. Historically, earthquakes have been responsible for massive loss of life, extensive property damage, and economic disruption. For instance, the 2023 Kahramanmaras-Gaziantep earthquake in Turkey, with a magnitude of 7.8, resulted in widespread destruction and significant loss of life, underscoring the urgent need for advanced earthquake engineering practices [1]. The importance of earthquake engineering is further highlighted by the increasing frequency and intensity of seismic events, which have been exacerbated by factors such as urbanization, population growth, and climate change.

Earthquake engineering encompasses a broad range of activities, including seismic hazard assessment, structural design, and risk mitigation. One of the primary goals of this field is to ensure that structures can withstand the forces generated by earthquakes without collapsing or causing significant damage. This involves the application of principles from geology, seismology, and structural engineering to develop resilient infrastructure. For example, the use of seismic isolation techniques, such as base isolators and energy dissipation systems, has been shown to significantly reduce the seismic forces transmitted to buildings [2]. These technologies are designed to absorb and dissipate energy, thereby protecting structures from the destructive effects of seismic waves.

The challenges faced in earthquake engineering are multifaceted and include issues related to data scarcity, uncertainty in predictions, and the complexity of seismic events. One of the major challenges is the unpredictability of earthquakes, which makes it difficult to develop accurate models for predicting their occurrence and intensity. Despite advancements in seismic monitoring and data collection, the lack of comprehensive and reliable data remains a significant barrier to improving earthquake engineering practices. For example, the development of accurate earthquake prediction models is hindered by the limited availability of historical seismic data and the difficulty in interpreting complex seismic patterns [3]. Additionally, the uncertainty inherent in seismic events poses a significant challenge for engineers and planners, as it complicates the design and implementation of resilient infrastructure.

Another key challenge in earthquake engineering is the need to balance safety and cost-effectiveness. The construction of earthquake-resistant structures often involves higher initial costs, which can be a deterrent for developers and governments. However, the long-term benefits of investing in earthquake-resistant infrastructure, such as reduced repair costs and increased safety, far outweigh the initial expenses. For instance, the use of advanced materials and innovative design techniques can enhance the resilience of buildings while maintaining cost-effectiveness [4]. Furthermore, the integration of machine learning and other advanced technologies into earthquake engineering has the potential to improve the accuracy of seismic risk assessments and reduce the need for extensive physical testing.

The importance of earthquake engineering is also reflected in its role in disaster management and response. Effective earthquake engineering practices can significantly reduce the impact of seismic events on communities and economies. For example, the development of early warning systems, such as those based on deep learning and real-time data processing, has the potential to save lives by providing timely alerts to populations at risk [5]. These systems rely on sophisticated algorithms to detect seismic waves and provide warnings before the damaging S waves arrive, allowing people to take protective actions.

In addition to its role in disaster prevention, earthquake engineering plays a crucial role in post-disaster recovery and resilience. The ability to assess and repair damaged infrastructure quickly is essential for restoring normalcy and minimizing long-term economic impacts. For example, the use of machine learning models to predict the extent of damage to buildings and other structures can aid in prioritizing repair efforts and allocating resources effectively [6]. These models can analyze data from seismic sensors and other sources to identify critical areas that require immediate attention, thereby facilitating a more efficient and targeted response.

The field of earthquake engineering is also evolving in response to emerging technologies and new challenges. The integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other advanced computational methods is transforming the way earthquakes are studied and mitigated. For instance, the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has shown promise in improving the accuracy of seismic response predictions by incorporating physical laws and constraints into machine learning models [7]. These models can provide more reliable predictions of structural behavior under seismic loads, enabling engineers to design more resilient infrastructure.

Overall, the significance of earthquake engineering cannot be overstated. It is a vital discipline that addresses the complex challenges posed by seismic events and plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and resilience of structures. By leveraging advances in technology and data science, earthquake engineering continues to evolve and improve, offering new opportunities for mitigating the impact of earthquakes on communities and economies. As the frequency and intensity of seismic events continue to rise, the importance of earthquake engineering will only grow, making it an essential area of focus for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

### 1.2 Traditional Methods in Earthquake Engineering

Traditional methods in earthquake engineering have long been the cornerstone of seismic risk assessment, structural design, and hazard mitigation. These methods primarily include empirical, physics-based, and statistical approaches, each with its own strengths and limitations in addressing the complex challenges posed by seismic events. Despite significant advancements, these conventional techniques often struggle with the inherent uncertainties, nonlinearities, and dynamic complexities associated with earthquake engineering problems. This subsection provides an overview of these traditional methods, their applications, and the challenges they face in modern seismic engineering.

Empirical methods, for instance, have historically been used to establish relationships between observed seismic events and their associated parameters. These methods are based on the analysis of historical earthquake data, often derived from past seismic events, and are used to develop predictive models for seismic hazards. Empirical approaches include ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs), which are widely used to estimate the intensity of ground shaking at a given location based on factors such as earthquake magnitude, distance from the source, and local site conditions [8]. However, these methods are inherently limited by the availability and quality of historical data, which may not be sufficient to capture the full range of possible seismic scenarios. Moreover, empirical models often lack the ability to account for the physical processes that govern seismic wave propagation and ground response, making them less reliable for predicting rare or extreme events [7].

Physics-based models, on the other hand, aim to simulate the physical processes involved in earthquake generation and propagation using the fundamental laws of mechanics and thermodynamics. These models are based on the principles of continuum mechanics, elasticity, and wave propagation, and are often implemented using numerical methods such as finite element analysis (FEA) and finite difference methods [9]. Physics-based approaches provide a more rigorous and mechanistic understanding of seismic behavior, enabling engineers to predict the response of structures to dynamic loads with greater accuracy. However, these models are computationally intensive and require significant computational resources, which can be a major limitation in practical applications. Additionally, the complexity of real-world seismic events often necessitates simplifications and assumptions that may reduce the predictive accuracy of the models [10].

Statistical techniques are another essential component of traditional earthquake engineering. These methods rely on probabilistic models to assess the likelihood of seismic events and their potential impacts. Statistical approaches are commonly used to develop fragility curves, which describe the probability of structural failure as a function of ground motion intensity [11]. These models are based on the assumption that seismic events follow certain probability distributions, allowing engineers to estimate the risk of failure for different types of structures under various seismic scenarios. However, statistical methods are often sensitive to the quality and representativeness of the data used to train the models. Inadequate or biased data can lead to inaccurate predictions, and the assumption of independence among variables may not always hold true in real-world applications [12].

Despite their contributions, traditional methods face significant challenges in addressing the complex and dynamic nature of seismic events. One of the primary limitations is the inability to account for the uncertainties inherent in seismic data. Seismic events are highly stochastic, and the data collected from seismic stations are often noisy and incomplete. Traditional models may struggle to incorporate these uncertainties, leading to overconfident predictions that may not accurately reflect the true risks [13]. Additionally, the nonlinearity of seismic wave propagation and the complex interactions between structures and the ground pose significant challenges for traditional methods, which often rely on linear approximations that may not capture the true behavior of the system [10].

Another major challenge is the computational cost associated with traditional methods. Physics-based models, in particular, require extensive computational resources to simulate complex seismic events, making them impractical for real-time applications. Statistical methods also face limitations in terms of scalability, as they often require large datasets to train accurate models. The need for high computational efficiency and real-time processing has become increasingly important in modern earthquake engineering, particularly in the context of early warning systems and real-time monitoring [14].

Furthermore, traditional methods often lack the ability to generalize to new or unseen seismic scenarios. Empirical models are typically calibrated using data from specific regions or events, and their performance may degrade when applied to different geological settings or seismic conditions [8]. Physics-based models, while more robust, may still fail to capture the full range of seismic behaviors due to the simplifications and assumptions made during the modeling process [10]. Statistical methods are also subject to the limitations of the data they are trained on, and their performance may be compromised in the absence of sufficient and representative data.

In summary, traditional methods in earthquake engineering have provided valuable insights into seismic behavior and risk assessment, but they face significant challenges in addressing the complex and dynamic nature of seismic events. The limitations of these methods highlight the need for more advanced and adaptive approaches, such as machine learning, to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of seismic analysis and prediction. The next section will explore the emergence of machine learning in seismology and its potential to revolutionize earthquake engineering.

### 1.3 Emergence of Machine Learning in Seismology

The emergence of machine learning in seismology marks a significant shift in how we approach the challenges of earthquake monitoring, prediction, and risk assessment. Historically, seismic data analysis relied heavily on traditional methods rooted in physics-based models and empirical observations. These approaches, while foundational, often struggled with the inherent complexity and non-linear behavior of seismic events. As seismic data volumes have grown exponentially, particularly with the proliferation of seismic stations and advanced sensor technologies, the limitations of conventional techniques have become increasingly apparent. In this context, machine learning has emerged as a transformative force, addressing many of the longstanding challenges in seismology by offering powerful tools for data-driven insights and predictive modeling.

One of the most notable areas where machine learning has made an impact is in earthquake detection. Traditional methods for identifying seismic events often rely on manual inspection or pre-defined thresholds, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially in noisy environments. Machine learning, particularly deep learning, has shown remarkable potential in automating the detection of seismic signals. For instance, the work on the Seismogram Transformer (SeisT) [15] has demonstrated that deep learning models can outperform traditional methods in tasks such as phase picking, magnitude estimation, and epicenter location. By leveraging the power of deep learning, SeisT not only improves the accuracy of earthquake detection but also enhances its robustness in real-time applications. Similarly, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in earthquake detection has been explored in multiple studies, including the work by Perol et al. [14], where a CNN was trained to distinguish between seismic events and noise, achieving high accuracy in detecting low-magnitude earthquakes. These advancements are crucial for early warning systems, as they enable rapid and reliable detection of seismic activity, which is vital for mitigating the impact of earthquakes.

Another critical area where machine learning is making a significant impact is in the prediction of seismic events. While earthquake prediction remains one of the most challenging problems in seismology, machine learning offers new possibilities by uncovering complex patterns in seismic data that are not easily discernible through traditional methods. The study on spatiotemporal pattern mining for nowcasting extreme earthquakes in Southern California [16] highlights the potential of deep learning models in capturing the intricate dynamics of seismic events. By analyzing historical seismic data and identifying patterns that correlate with extreme earthquakes, these models can provide early warnings and improve the accuracy of seismic risk assessments. Moreover, the integration of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) into earthquake prediction models has shown promise in enhancing the reliability of predictions by incorporating physical laws and constraints [10]. This approach not only improves the predictive accuracy but also ensures that the models adhere to the fundamental principles of seismology, making them more interpretable and trustworthy.

In addition to detection and prediction, machine learning is also revolutionizing the field of seismic risk assessment. Traditional risk assessment models often rely on simplified assumptions and may fail to account for the complex interactions between seismic events and the built environment. Machine learning, on the other hand, enables the development of more sophisticated and data-driven risk assessment models. For example, the use of explainable AI (XAI) in predicting liquefaction-induced lateral spreading [17] has demonstrated how machine learning can provide transparent and interpretable predictions, which are essential for making informed decisions in geotechnical engineering. Similarly, the application of deep learning in seismic response prediction for nonlinear steel moment-resisting frame structures [7] has shown that machine learning can effectively capture the complex behavior of structures under seismic loading, leading to more accurate and reliable risk assessments.

The integration of machine learning with physics-based models is another key area where the field is evolving. While physics-based models are essential for understanding the fundamental mechanics of earthquakes, they often require extensive computational resources and may not be feasible for real-time applications. Machine learning models, when combined with physics-based insights, can bridge this gap by providing efficient and accurate predictions. For instance, the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has been explored in the context of seismic inversion and subsurface imaging, where the integration of physical constraints into the learning process has led to more reliable and interpretable results [10]. This approach not only enhances the accuracy of predictions but also ensures that the models remain consistent with the underlying physical principles, making them more robust and generalizable.

Overall, the emergence of machine learning in seismology represents a paradigm shift in how we approach the challenges of earthquake monitoring, prediction, and risk assessment. By leveraging the power of data-driven models, seismologists are now able to uncover complex patterns, improve the accuracy of predictions, and develop more robust and interpretable models. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of machine learning with physics-based approaches and the development of more sophisticated algorithms will be crucial in addressing the remaining challenges in seismology. The potential of machine learning to revolutionize earthquake engineering is evident, and its continued application will undoubtedly lead to significant advancements in our understanding and mitigation of seismic risks.

### 1.4 Key Challenges in Earthquake Engineering

[18]

Earthquake engineering is a complex and multidisciplinary field that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of structures to withstand the effects of earthquakes. Despite significant advances in the field, several key challenges persist, which hinder the accurate prediction, monitoring, and mitigation of seismic risks. These challenges include data scarcity, uncertainty in predictions, and the inherent complexity of seismic events. Addressing these issues is crucial for improving the reliability and effectiveness of earthquake engineering practices.

One of the primary challenges in earthquake engineering is data scarcity. Seismic data is often limited in both quantity and quality, making it difficult to train robust machine learning models that can accurately predict earthquake behavior. For instance, the availability of high-quality seismic data is often constrained by the limited number of seismic monitoring stations, especially in remote or underdeveloped regions. This scarcity of data poses a significant challenge for the development of machine learning models that require large and diverse datasets to generalize well across different seismic events and regions. In addition, the data collected may be noisy or incomplete, further complicating the analysis. For example, the paper titled "Signal-based Bayesian Seismic Monitoring" highlights the difficulty of detecting weak seismic events from noisy sensor data, emphasizing the need for advanced data processing techniques [13]. Similarly, the study "Data-Driven Prediction of Seismic Intensity Distributions Featuring Hybrid Classification-Regression Models" underscores the importance of high-quality data for accurate predictions, as the proposed model outperformed traditional methods due to its data-driven approach [8].

Another major challenge is the uncertainty inherent in seismic predictions. Earthquakes are stochastic events, and their occurrence, magnitude, and location are difficult to predict with high accuracy. This uncertainty is exacerbated by the complex and nonlinear nature of seismic processes, which involve interactions between various geological and physical factors. For instance, the paper "Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction" discusses the challenges of incorporating physical constraints into machine learning models to ensure that predictions are both accurate and physically meaningful [10]. The authors emphasize the need for models that can handle the uncertainty in the input data and provide reliable predictions despite the inherent variability in seismic events. Furthermore, the study "Uncertainty Quantification of Structural Systems with Subset of Data" highlights the importance of quantifying uncertainty in material properties and input ground motions to improve the reliability of structural response predictions [19]. The authors propose a matrix completion method that allows for the estimation of structural responses from a limited subset of data, demonstrating the potential of machine learning techniques to address the challenges of data scarcity and uncertainty.

The complexity of seismic events also presents a significant challenge in earthquake engineering. Seismic events are highly variable and can be influenced by a multitude of factors, including the geological structure of the region, the depth and magnitude of the earthquake, and the characteristics of the surrounding environment. This complexity makes it difficult to develop models that can accurately predict the behavior of structures during seismic events. For example, the paper "Deep Learning for Laboratory Earthquake Prediction and Autoregressive Forecasting of Fault Zone Stress" explores the use of deep learning models to predict laboratory earthquakes and fault zone stress [20]. The authors note that the complexity of the seismic processes in the laboratory setting requires models that can capture the dynamic interactions between different components of the system. Similarly, the study "Earthquake Nowcasting with Deep Learning" investigates the use of deep learning models to nowcast earthquake activity, highlighting the challenges of modeling the spatiotemporal patterns of seismic events [21]. The authors emphasize the need for models that can handle the high-dimensional and nonlinear nature of seismic data, which requires advanced machine learning techniques.

In addition to these challenges, the integration of machine learning with traditional physics-based models is another critical issue in earthquake engineering. While machine learning models can capture complex patterns in seismic data, they often lack the physical interpretability required for reliable predictions. This is where physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and other hybrid approaches come into play, as they incorporate physical laws and domain knowledge into the learning process. For instance, the paper "Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction" presents a multi-network PINN that integrates the physics of motion in the solid Earth to improve the accuracy of seismic hazard assessments [10]. The authors demonstrate that incorporating physical constraints into the learning process can enhance the reliability of predictions, making it easier to interpret the results and apply them in practical scenarios.

Furthermore, the challenges of model generalization and out-of-distribution performance are significant in earthquake engineering. Machine learning models trained on data from a specific region may not perform well when applied to different regions or seismic conditions. This is a common issue in the field, as the characteristics of seismic events can vary significantly across different geographical areas. For example, the study "Generalized Neural Networks for Real-Time Earthquake Early Warning" highlights the importance of developing models that can generalize to diverse regions and monitoring setups [22]. The authors propose a data recombination method to create generalized earthquakes that can be used to train models for different locations, ensuring that the models can be applied effectively in a variety of settings.

In conclusion, the challenges of data scarcity, uncertainty in predictions, and the complexity of seismic events are critical issues that must be addressed in earthquake engineering. These challenges not only hinder the development of accurate and reliable models but also limit the effectiveness of earthquake prediction and mitigation strategies. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, integrating physics-based models, and addressing the limitations of current methodologies, researchers can make significant progress in overcoming these challenges and improving the safety and resilience of structures in seismic-prone regions. The ongoing research and development in this field are essential for advancing our understanding of seismic processes and developing more effective solutions for earthquake engineering.

### 1.5 Machine Learning Techniques in Earthquake Engineering

Machine learning (ML) techniques have gained significant traction in earthquake engineering due to their ability to process and analyze complex seismic data, identify patterns, and make predictions with high accuracy. These techniques encompass a wide range of methods, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning, each with distinct applications and relevance to different tasks in earthquake engineering. The integration of these ML techniques has revolutionized the field, offering new solutions to longstanding challenges such as earthquake prediction, structural health monitoring, and risk assessment.

Supervised learning is one of the most widely used ML techniques in earthquake engineering. It involves training models on labeled datasets, where each input is associated with a corresponding output. This approach is particularly useful for tasks such as earthquake detection, magnitude estimation, and structural health monitoring. For example, supervised learning algorithms like regression and classification models have been employed to predict earthquake magnitudes based on seismic data [23]. These models are trained on historical earthquake data, allowing them to identify patterns and make accurate predictions. However, the effectiveness of supervised learning depends heavily on the quality and quantity of labeled data, which can be a challenge in earthquake engineering due to the rarity of large earthquake events.

Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, does not rely on labeled data and instead focuses on identifying patterns and structures within the data. This technique is particularly useful for tasks such as anomaly detection, clustering, and data segmentation. In the context of earthquake engineering, unsupervised learning has been applied to detect anomalies in seismic data, such as unusual patterns that may indicate the onset of an earthquake [24]. By clustering similar seismic events, researchers can identify potential earthquake precursors and improve their understanding of seismic activity. Additionally, unsupervised learning techniques have been used to segment seismic data into meaningful categories, facilitating the analysis of complex seismic patterns.

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with multiple layers, has emerged as a powerful tool for processing and analyzing large-scale seismic data. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, have been successfully applied to various tasks in earthquake engineering. For instance, CNNs have been used to detect and classify seismic events by analyzing seismic waveforms [23]. These models are capable of capturing spatial and temporal patterns in seismic data, enabling accurate detection and classification of earthquakes. RNNs and LSTMs, on the other hand, are well-suited for analyzing time-series data, making them ideal for tasks such as earthquake prediction and early warning systems [20].

In addition to these techniques, hybrid and physics-informed learning models have been developed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of predictions. These models integrate machine learning with physics-based constraints, ensuring that the predictions adhere to physical laws and principles. For example, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been used to model earthquake fault dynamics and predict seismic activity [10]. By incorporating physical equations into the training process, these models can generate more accurate and physically meaningful predictions. Hybrid models that combine the strengths of machine learning with traditional physics-based simulations have also been explored, offering a balanced approach to earthquake prediction and risk assessment [7].

Transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques have also gained attention in earthquake engineering, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. These methods allow models trained on one dataset to be adapted to new tasks or domains, improving their generalization capabilities. For instance, transfer learning has been used to improve the performance of earthquake detection models by leveraging knowledge from related tasks [23]. This approach is particularly useful for regions with limited seismic data, as it enables the reuse of existing models to make accurate predictions.

Explainable and interpretable machine learning models are another important aspect of earthquake engineering. These models provide insights into the decision-making process, making them more transparent and trustworthy. Techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have been used to interpret the predictions of machine learning models, enhancing their usability in critical applications [17]. By making the models more interpretable, researchers can better understand the factors influencing their predictions, leading to more reliable and actionable insights.

Reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions through trial and error, has also been explored in earthquake engineering. This technique is particularly useful for optimizing seismic monitoring and mitigation strategies. For example, reinforcement learning has been used to control earthquake-like instabilities by adjusting injection policies in industrial projects [25]. These models can adapt to changing conditions and improve their performance over time, making them valuable for real-time applications.

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been applied to process multivariate time-series data from seismic stations, capturing spatial relationships and improving earthquake monitoring and prediction [26]. These models are particularly effective in scenarios where data from multiple sensors need to be analyzed simultaneously, as they can account for the dependencies between different data sources.

Self-supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches have also been explored in seismic data analysis, particularly for tasks where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain [27]. These techniques enable models to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data, reducing the need for extensive labeled datasets.

Generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), have been used to synthesize seismic data and enhance the training of machine learning models, improving their robustness and generalization capabilities [28]. By generating realistic seismic data, these models can help overcome the limitations of small or incomplete datasets, leading to more accurate predictions.

Overall, the diverse range of machine learning techniques available in earthquake engineering offers powerful tools for addressing the complex challenges of seismic data analysis, prediction, and risk assessment. By leveraging these techniques, researchers and practitioners can develop more accurate and reliable solutions, ultimately contributing to the safety and resilience of structures in earthquake-prone regions.

### 1.6 Machine Learning for Seismic Data Analysis

Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative tool in seismic data analysis, enabling more efficient and accurate processing of complex geophysical signals. Traditional methods for seismic data processing often rely on manual or semi-automated techniques, which are time-consuming and prone to errors. With the advent of ML, researchers and practitioners have been able to develop automated systems for signal processing, noise reduction, and pattern recognition, significantly enhancing the capabilities of seismic monitoring and analysis.

One of the key applications of ML in seismic data analysis is signal processing. Seismic signals are often contaminated by various types of noise, making it difficult to extract meaningful information. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and autoencoders, have been successfully employed to enhance the quality of seismic data by removing noise and improving signal clarity [29]. For instance, autoassociative neural networks (autoNNs) have been used to reduce random noise in geophysical data, achieving significant improvements in signal quality while preserving important features [29]. These models learn to reconstruct the original signal from noisy inputs, making them particularly effective for denoising tasks.

In addition to noise reduction, ML has also been applied to pattern recognition in seismic data. Seismic events often exhibit complex patterns that are difficult for traditional methods to detect and classify. Machine learning algorithms, particularly supervised learning techniques, have been used to identify and classify these patterns. For example, a study demonstrated the effectiveness of using a variant of the Mel spectrogram to scale the raw frequencies of seismic data according to the hearing of animals that can sense disasters from seismic signals. This approach, combined with clustering algorithms, has been used to classify unlabelled seismic data [30]. Such methods have the potential to improve the accuracy of seismic event detection and classification, particularly in scenarios where manual labeling is impractical.

Another important application of ML in seismic data analysis is in the detection of seismic events. Deep learning models, including CNNs and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been employed to detect seismic events in real-time. These models can process large volumes of seismic data and identify patterns indicative of seismic activity. For instance, the use of deep learning for the detection of seismic waves has shown promising results, with models capable of distinguishing between normal seismic noise and actual earthquake signals [31]. The ability of these models to learn from large datasets and adapt to new data makes them highly effective for real-time seismic monitoring.

Machine learning has also been applied to the task of seismic data denoising, which is crucial for improving the accuracy of seismic imaging and interpretation. Traditional denoising methods often rely on hand-crafted filters and regularizations, which may not be as effective as deep learning approaches. A study demonstrated the use of a deep learning model for the denoising of seismic data, achieving superior performance compared to conventional methods [32]. The model was able to effectively remove random noise while preserving the integrity of the seismic signal. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the quality of seismic data, enabling more accurate analysis and interpretation.

In the context of seismic data analysis, ML has also been used to detect and classify different types of seismic events. For example, a study proposed a method for the detection of seismic phase arrivals using deep learning, which has been shown to be effective in identifying the onset of seismic waves [23]. The ability to accurately detect and classify seismic phases is essential for understanding the nature of seismic events and predicting their potential impact.

Furthermore, ML techniques have been employed to enhance the accuracy of seismic data interpretation. For instance, a study demonstrated the use of deep learning for the classification of seismic facies, which is crucial for understanding the geological structure of the subsurface [33]. The proposed method, CONSS, uses a contrastive learning approach to efficiently identify seismic facies using only a small fraction of the original annotations. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce the need for extensive manual labeling, making seismic data analysis more efficient and cost-effective.

In summary, machine learning has revolutionized the field of seismic data analysis by providing powerful tools for signal processing, noise reduction, and pattern recognition. The application of ML in seismic data analysis has led to significant improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of seismic monitoring and interpretation. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of ML with traditional seismic data processing techniques is expected to further enhance our ability to understand and predict seismic events. The continued development of ML algorithms and their application to seismic data will play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of seismic processes and improving earthquake risk assessment.

### 1.7 Deep Learning for Earthquake Detection and Prediction

Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for earthquake detection and prediction, offering significant improvements over traditional methods. By leveraging the ability of neural networks to learn complex patterns from large datasets, deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown great promise in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of earthquake monitoring systems. These models are particularly useful in addressing the challenges posed by earthquake engineering, such as the need for real-time monitoring and early warning systems. For instance, the study titled "Generalized Neural Networks for Real-Time Earthquake Early Warning" [22] highlights the effectiveness of deep learning in creating generalized models that can be applied to various regions with different monitoring setups for earthquake detection and parameter evaluation from continuous seismic waveform streams. These models can reliably report earthquake locations and magnitudes within 4 seconds after the first triggered station, which is crucial for early warning systems.

In the context of real-time monitoring, deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in detecting and predicting earthquakes. The paper "Real-time Earthquake Early Warning with Deep Learning Application to the 2016 Central Apennines, Italy Earthquake Sequence" [5] presents a novel deep learning earthquake early warning system that utilizes fully convolutional networks to simultaneously detect earthquakes and estimate their source parameters from continuous seismic waveform streams. This system determines earthquake location and magnitude as soon as one station receives earthquake signals and evolutionarily improves the solutions by receiving continuous data. The results indicate that the system can reliably determine earthquake locations and magnitudes as early as four seconds after the earliest P phase, significantly improving the response time for disaster mitigation efforts.

CNNs have been particularly effective in processing seismic data for earthquake detection. The study "CRED A Deep Residual Network of Convolutional and Recurrent Units for Earthquake Signal Detection" [34] introduces the Cnn-Rnn Earthquake Detector (CRED), a detector based on deep neural networks that uses a combination of convolutional layers and bi-directional long-short-term memory units in a residual structure. The model is trained using 500,000 seismograms and achieves an F-score of 99.95. The robustness of the trained model with respect to noise level and non-earthquake signals is shown by applying it to a set of semi-synthetic signals. The model is applied to one month of continuous data recorded at Central Arkansas to demonstrate its efficiency, generalization, and sensitivity. The results indicate that the model is able to detect more than 700 microearthquakes as small as -1.3 ML induced during hydraulic fracturing far away than the training region, showcasing the potential of CNNs in earthquake detection.

RNNs, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have also shown promise in earthquake detection and prediction. The study "Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks help to predict location of Earthquakes" [35] examines the applicability of modern neural network architectures to the midterm prediction of earthquakes. The data-based classification model aims to predict if an earthquake with the magnitude above a threshold takes place at a given area of size $10 \times 10$ kilometers in $10$-$60$ days from a given moment. The deep neural network model has a recurrent part (LSTM) that accounts for time dependencies between earthquakes and a convolutional part that accounts for spatial dependencies. The results show that neural networks-based models beat baseline feature-based models that also account for spatio-temporal dependencies between different earthquakes, highlighting the potential of RNNs in earthquake prediction.

GANs have also been utilized in the context of earthquake detection and prediction. The study "SeismoGen Seismic Waveform Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks" [28] proposes a novel approach to damage mapping, combining deep learning with the full time history of SAR observations of an impacted region in order to detect anomalous variations in the Earth's surface properties due to a natural disaster. The study demonstrates that GANs can generate synthetic samples that improve the detectability of earthquake classification models. This capability is particularly valuable in scenarios where labeled data is scarce, as GANs can generate synthetic data to augment training datasets and improve the performance of machine learning models.

Moreover, deep learning models have been integrated with physics-based approaches to enhance their accuracy and reliability. The study "Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction" [10] presents a multi-network PINN for both the forward problem as well as for direct inversion of nonlinear fault friction parameters, constrained by the physics of motion in the solid Earth. This approach ensures that the model outcomes satisfy rigorous physical constraints, which is critical for reliable earthquake prediction and hazard assessment.

In addition to these models, deep learning has been used to develop hybrid AI-physical models that combine the strengths of machine learning with traditional physics-based simulations. The study "SeisT A foundational deep learning model for earthquake monitoring tasks" [15] introduces a foundational deep learning model, the Seismogram Transformer (SeisT), designed for a variety of earthquake monitoring tasks. SeisT combines multiple modules tailored to different tasks and exhibits impressive out-of-distribution generalization performance, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art models in tasks like earthquake detection, seismic phase picking, first-motion polarity classification, magnitude estimation, back-azimuth estimation, and epicentral distance estimation.

Overall, the integration of deep learning with physics-based models and the use of advanced neural network architectures have significantly enhanced the capabilities of earthquake detection and prediction systems. These models not only improve the accuracy and efficiency of real-time monitoring but also provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of seismic events. As research in this area continues to advance, the potential for deep learning to revolutionize earthquake engineering and disaster management is becoming increasingly evident.

### 1.8 Machine Learning in Structural Health Monitoring

Machine Learning (ML) has significantly transformed the field of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), offering innovative solutions for damage detection in buildings, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. Traditional SHM approaches have relied heavily on manual inspections and physical sensors, which are often time-consuming, expensive, and limited in their ability to detect subtle or early-stage damage. The integration of ML techniques into SHM has revolutionized the process, enabling more accurate, efficient, and automated damage detection. This subsection explores the application of ML in SHM, emphasizing its role in detecting and assessing damage in various types of infrastructure.

One of the most prominent applications of ML in SHM is the use of deep learning techniques for damage detection. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable performance in identifying structural damage by analyzing vibration data and images. For example, a study presented a CNN-based approach for structural damage detection using time-series sensor data, demonstrating high accuracy in identifying structural degradation [36]. This method leveraged the spatial and temporal features of sensor data to improve discrimination capabilities compared to traditional methods. Similarly, another study introduced a Hierarchical CNN and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) framework to model both spatial and temporal relations for structural damage detection, achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets [37].

In addition to CNNs, other deep learning models have also been employed in SHM. For instance, a study demonstrated the use of a mechanics-informed autoencoder for automated detection and localization of unforeseen structural damage [38]. This approach utilized a synergistic combination of passive measurements from inexpensive sensors and a mechanics-informed autoencoder to continuously learn and adapt a bespoke baseline model for each structure. The results showed that this method could detect and localize damage up to 35% earlier than a standard autoencoder, significantly improving the efficiency of damage detection.

Another notable application of ML in SHM is the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation and damage detection. GANs have been employed to generate synthetic vibration data, which can be used to train ML models when real data is scarce or expensive to obtain. A study proposed a 1-D Wasserstein Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (1-D WDCGAN-GP) for generating labeled acceleration data, which was then used to augment training datasets for damage detection applications [39]. The results showed that the 1-D WDCGAN-GP could effectively address data scarcity in vibration-based damage detection. Similarly, another study introduced a CycleGAN for undamaged-to-damaged domain translation, which demonstrated the ability to accurately generate damaged responses from undamaged responses, enabling a more proactive approach to damage detection [40].

The integration of ML with sensor networks has also played a crucial role in SHM. Edge-AI, which involves deploying ML models on edge devices for real-time processing, has been explored for structural health monitoring. A study investigated the use of edge-AI in SHM for real-time bridge inspections, utilizing commercial edge-AI platforms such as Google Coral Dev Board or Kneron KL520 to develop and analyze the effectiveness of edge-AI devices [41]. The study demonstrated that an edge-AI-compatible deep learning model could perform real-time crack classification with high accuracy, reducing the need for extensive data transmission to the cloud.

In addition to deep learning, other ML techniques such as unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning have also been applied in SHM. For example, a study proposed a semi-supervised method using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) for structural damage detection [42]. This approach utilized the VAE to approximate the undamaged data distribution and the OC-SVM to discriminate different health conditions using damage-sensitive features extracted from the VAE's signal reconstruction. The results showed that this method could effectively detect structural anomalies with high accuracy.

The application of ML in SHM has also extended to the use of computer vision techniques for damage detection. A study proposed a convolutional cost-sensitive crack localization algorithm for automated and reliable RC bridge inspection [43]. This approach utilized deep learning semantic segmentation frameworks to automatically localize surface cracks, addressing the challenges of class imbalance and noisy data. Another study introduced a hierarchical semantic segmentation framework for computer vision-based bridge damage detection, leveraging the hierarchical semantic relationship between component categories and damage types to improve detection accuracy [44].

The use of ML in SHM is not limited to damage detection but also includes other aspects such as structural condition assessment and risk evaluation. A study proposed a framework for structural corrosion detection from drone images using ensemble deep learning [45]. This approach utilized a novel ensemble deep learning method underpinned by CNNs for structural identification and corrosion feature extraction, demonstrating superior classification accuracy compared to existing methods. Another study explored the use of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) for uncertainty quantification in SHM, addressing the limitations of traditional neural networks in capturing uncertainty in network outputs [46].

Overall, the application of ML in SHM has significantly enhanced the capabilities of damage detection in buildings, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. The integration of deep learning, unsupervised learning, and computer vision techniques has provided more accurate, efficient, and automated solutions for structural health monitoring. As the field continues to evolve, the combination of ML with domain-specific knowledge and physics-based models will further enhance the reliability and interpretability of SHM systems, ensuring the safety and resilience of critical infrastructure.

### 1.9 Integration of Machine Learning with Physics-Based Models

The integration of machine learning with physics-based models represents a transformative approach in advancing the accuracy and reliability of predictions in complex scientific and engineering systems. Traditional physics-based models, while rooted in well-established principles, often face limitations in handling high-dimensional, nonlinear, and uncertain data. Machine learning, on the other hand, excels at extracting patterns and making predictions from large datasets, but it lacks the inherent physical consistency that physics-based models provide. By integrating these two paradigms, researchers have developed hybrid frameworks that leverage the strengths of both approaches, particularly through the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) [47]. This integration ensures that the models not only learn from data but also adhere to the fundamental laws of physics, thereby enhancing their interpretability, generalizability, and predictive power.

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a prime example of how machine learning can be seamlessly embedded with physics-based knowledge. These networks incorporate governing equations, such as partial differential equations (PDEs), into the loss function during training, effectively constraining the model to satisfy physical laws. This approach has proven particularly effective in scenarios where data is sparse or noisy, as the inclusion of physical constraints compensates for the lack of high-quality observational data. For instance, in the study of subsurface flow and transport, PINNs have been used to model complex geophysical systems, where the governing equations provide a strong theoretical foundation for the predictions [48]. By enforcing these physical laws, PINNs produce results that are not only data-driven but also physically consistent, which is crucial for applications in earth sciences and engineering.

Moreover, the integration of machine learning with physics-based models has also addressed challenges related to model generalization and robustness. Traditional machine learning models often struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios, especially when the data distribution changes. However, physics-informed models, by design, incorporate domain-specific knowledge that enhances their ability to generalize. This is particularly evident in the study of fluid dynamics and heat transfer, where PINNs have been shown to accurately predict system behavior under varying conditions [49]. The integration of physical laws into the learning process ensures that the models remain reliable even when faced with new or extrapolated data, making them a valuable tool in real-world applications.

Another significant benefit of integrating machine learning with physics-based models is the ability to handle complex, high-dimensional systems that are difficult to simulate with traditional methods. For example, in the context of seismic imaging and waveform inversion, machine learning techniques have been combined with physics-based models to improve the resolution and accuracy of subsurface property estimation [48]. These hybrid approaches not only reduce the computational cost of simulations but also provide more accurate and interpretable results. By embedding physical constraints into the learning process, these models can capture the intricate relationships between variables and provide insights into the underlying physical mechanisms.

In addition to improving accuracy, the integration of machine learning with physics-based models has also enhanced the interpretability of predictions. Machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, are often considered "black boxes," making it challenging to understand how they arrive at their predictions. By incorporating physics-based constraints, these models become more transparent and interpretable, as the predictions are grounded in well-established physical laws. For instance, in the study of dynamical systems, physics-informed models have been shown to provide insights into the stability and long-term behavior of the system [50]. This enhanced interpretability is crucial for applications in earth sciences, where understanding the underlying physical processes is essential for risk assessment and decision-making.

The integration of machine learning with physics-based models has also led to the development of new methodologies for handling uncertainty and noise in data. In many real-world applications, the data is often incomplete, noisy, or uncertain. Physics-informed models address these challenges by incorporating physical constraints that act as regularizers, reducing the impact of noise and improving the robustness of the predictions. For example, in the context of structural health monitoring, physics-informed neural networks have been used to detect and classify damage in buildings and bridges, even when the data is sparse or corrupted [51]. The inclusion of physical laws ensures that the models remain reliable and accurate, even under adverse conditions.

Furthermore, the integration of machine learning with physics-based models has opened up new avenues for interdisciplinary research and innovation. By combining the strengths of machine learning and physics, researchers have developed novel approaches to tackle complex problems in various domains. For instance, in the field of materials science, physics-informed models have been used to predict the behavior of complex materials under different loading conditions [49]. These models not only provide accurate predictions but also offer insights into the underlying physical mechanisms, facilitating the design of new materials and systems.

In conclusion, the integration of machine learning with physics-based models has emerged as a powerful approach for enhancing the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of predictions in complex scientific and engineering systems. Through the use of physics-informed neural networks and other hybrid frameworks, researchers have developed models that combine the strengths of data-driven learning with the robustness of physical laws. This integration has not only addressed the limitations of traditional physics-based models but also expanded the capabilities of machine learning, enabling it to tackle problems that were previously intractable. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of machine learning with physics-based models will play an increasingly important role in advancing our understanding of complex systems and improving the accuracy of predictions in earth sciences and beyond.

### 1.10 Machine Learning for Seismic Risk and Impact Assessment

Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative tool in assessing earthquake risks and estimating potential impacts, offering new possibilities for disaster management and response strategies. Traditional methods of seismic risk assessment often rely on empirical models, historical data, and probabilistic approaches, which, while useful, may not fully capture the complexity and uncertainty inherent in seismic events. Machine learning, with its capacity to process vast amounts of data and identify intricate patterns, provides a more dynamic and data-driven approach to seismic risk assessment. This section explores the role of machine learning in evaluating earthquake risks, estimating impacts, and supporting disaster management and response strategies.

One of the primary applications of machine learning in seismic risk assessment is the development of predictive models that can estimate the likelihood and potential consequences of earthquakes. These models leverage historical seismic data, geological information, and environmental factors to identify patterns and correlations that may not be apparent through traditional methods. For instance, the paper "Estimate Deformation Capacity of Non-Ductile RC Shear Walls using Explainable Boosting Machine" [52] discusses the use of machine learning to predict the deformation capacity of non-ductile reinforced concrete shear walls, which is critical in assessing the structural vulnerability of buildings during earthquakes. The study highlights the importance of accurate and reliable models in risk assessment, emphasizing the need for explainable machine learning techniques to ensure transparency and trust in the predictions.

In addition to structural risk assessment, machine learning plays a crucial role in estimating the potential impacts of earthquakes on human populations, infrastructure, and the environment.

The study demonstrates how machine learning can enhance the accuracy and timeliness of impact assessments, enabling more effective decision-making during disaster response.

Another significant application of machine learning in seismic risk assessment is the integration of geospatial data and remote sensing technologies. Satellite imagery and geospatial data provide valuable information about the distribution of vulnerable populations, infrastructure, and environmental conditions, which can be analyzed using machine learning to identify high-risk areas. The paper "Global Mapping of Exposure and Physical Vulnerability Dynamics in Least Developed Countries using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning" [54] discusses the use of machine learning to map exposure and vulnerability in least developed countries, providing critical information for disaster preparedness and response. The study highlights the potential of machine learning to support large-scale risk assessments and inform policy decisions at the national and global levels.

Machine learning also contributes to the development of early warning systems and disaster response strategies by enabling real-time monitoring and rapid decision-making. Real-time seismic data, combined with machine learning algorithms, can detect anomalies and predict seismic events with greater accuracy. The paper "Generalized Neural Networks for Real-Time Earthquake Early Warning" [22] presents a framework that uses generalized neural networks to detect earthquakes and estimate their parameters in real-time. The study shows how machine learning can enhance the effectiveness of early warning systems, allowing for timely alerts and mitigation measures that can save lives and reduce damage.

Moreover, machine learning supports disaster management by optimizing resource allocation and improving the efficiency of response efforts. By analyzing data from various sources, including social media, satellite imagery, and sensor networks, machine learning models can provide insights into the needs of affected communities and guide the deployment of resources. The paper "A Machine learning approach for rapid disaster response based on multi-modal data. The case of housing & shelter needs" [55] describes a machine learning workflow that integrates multimodal data to predict housing and shelter needs during disasters. The study demonstrates how machine learning can facilitate rapid and effective decision-making, ensuring that resources are allocated where they are most needed.

In addition to these applications, machine learning plays a vital role in improving the accuracy and reliability of seismic risk assessments through the use of ensemble methods and hybrid models. Ensemble learning techniques, such as those used in the paper "PreDisM: Pre-Disaster Modelling With CNN Ensembles for At-Risk Communities" [56], combine the strengths of multiple models to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. The study highlights the potential of ensemble learning in capturing complex patterns and reducing the impact of data scarcity on model performance.

Furthermore, the integration of machine learning with physics-based models enhances the accuracy and interpretability of seismic risk assessments. Physics-informed machine learning approaches, as discussed in the paper "Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction" [10], combine the strengths of data-driven models with the constraints of physical laws to improve the reliability of predictions. The study emphasizes the importance of incorporating domain knowledge into machine learning models to ensure that the predictions are physically consistent and reliable.

In conclusion, machine learning has revolutionized the field of seismic risk and impact assessment, offering new opportunities to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness of disaster management and response strategies. By leveraging historical data, geospatial information, and real-time monitoring, machine learning models provide valuable insights into the potential impacts of earthquakes, enabling better preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of machine learning with domain-specific knowledge and advanced computational techniques will be crucial in addressing the challenges of seismic risk assessment and disaster management.

### 1.11 Challenges and Limitations of Machine Learning in Earthquake Engineering

Machine learning (ML) has shown great promise in earthquake engineering, offering the potential to enhance prediction accuracy, improve structural health monitoring, and support disaster management. However, the application of ML in this domain is not without significant challenges and limitations. These challenges arise from the unique characteristics of seismic data, the complexity of earthquake-related phenomena, and the inherent limitations of ML models. Key challenges include data scarcity, model generalization, interpretability, and computational efficiency, all of which can significantly limit the effectiveness of ML in earthquake engineering.

One of the primary challenges in applying ML to earthquake engineering is data scarcity. Seismic data is inherently rare and often difficult to obtain due to the infrequency of significant earthquakes and the high cost of data acquisition. This scarcity of data poses a significant obstacle to training robust and reliable ML models, as many ML techniques require large and diverse datasets to achieve good performance. For instance, the paper "Augment & Valuate: A Data Enhancement Pipeline for Data-Centric AI" [57] highlights the challenges of data scarcity and proposes methods for data augmentation to improve model performance. However, even with data augmentation techniques, the quality and representativeness of the data remain critical issues that can affect the accuracy of ML models in earthquake engineering.

Another significant limitation is the issue of model generalization. ML models trained on historical seismic data may not perform well on new or unseen data, particularly in different geographical regions or under varying geological conditions. This is a common challenge in ML, as models often rely on patterns learned from training data, which may not generalize well to new scenarios. The paper "Out of Distribution Generalization in Machine Learning" [58] emphasizes the importance of addressing out-of-distribution generalization, as it is crucial for the reliability of ML models in real-world applications. In earthquake engineering, where the seismic environment can be highly variable, the ability of models to generalize to new and unseen data is essential for effective prediction and monitoring.

Interpretability is another critical challenge in the application of ML to earthquake engineering. Many ML models, particularly deep learning models, are often considered "black boxes" because their decision-making processes are not easily understandable. This lack of interpretability can be a significant barrier to the adoption of ML in critical applications such as earthquake prediction and structural health monitoring, where transparency and trust are essential. The paper "Interpretable Machine Learning: Fundamental Principles and 10 Grand Challenges" [59] highlights the importance of interpretability in ML and discusses the challenges of making complex models more transparent. In the context of earthquake engineering, developing interpretable models is crucial for ensuring that the predictions and insights provided by ML models are reliable and actionable.

Computational efficiency is another limitation that must be addressed in the application of ML to earthquake engineering. Seismic data is often large and complex, requiring significant computational resources for processing and analysis. The paper "Efficient and Robust Machine Learning for Real-World Systems" [60] discusses the need for resource-efficient ML techniques, particularly in real-time applications. In earthquake engineering, where real-time monitoring and rapid response are critical, the computational efficiency of ML models is essential. Techniques such as model compression, quantization, and efficient algorithm design are necessary to ensure that ML models can operate within the constraints of real-time systems.

In addition to these challenges, the integration of ML with physics-based models presents its own set of limitations. While physics-informed ML models can improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions, they often require careful integration of physical laws and domain knowledge into the ML framework. The paper "A unified sparse optimization framework to learn parsimonious physics-informed models from data" [61] discusses the importance of integrating physical constraints into ML models. However, the complexity of this integration can lead to increased computational costs and the need for specialized expertise, which can be a barrier to widespread adoption.

The issue of data quality and the presence of noise in seismic data also pose significant challenges. Seismic data can be contaminated with noise from various sources, including environmental factors and sensor errors. This noise can degrade the performance of ML models and lead to inaccurate predictions. The paper "Signal Denoising with Deep Learning" [62] explores the use of deep learning techniques for noise reduction in seismic data. However, the effectiveness of these techniques depends on the quality of the training data and the ability of the models to generalize to new data.

Another challenge is the potential for model bias and the ethical implications of using ML in earthquake engineering. The paper "Ecosystem-level Analysis of Deployed Machine Learning Reveals Homogeneous Outcomes" [63] highlights the risks of systemic failure in ML systems, where some users are consistently misclassified by all models. In earthquake engineering, where the stakes are high, ensuring that ML models are fair and unbiased is essential. Addressing these issues requires careful consideration of data sources, model training, and the potential impact of ML on vulnerable populations.

Finally, the long-term maintenance and updating of ML models in earthquake engineering present significant challenges. As seismic data and conditions evolve over time, ML models may become outdated or less effective. The paper "Safe AI for health and beyond -- Monitoring to transform a health service" [64] discusses the importance of monitoring and updating ML models to ensure their continued reliability. In earthquake engineering, where the consequences of model failure can be severe, ongoing maintenance and monitoring are critical.

In conclusion, while ML offers significant potential for advancing earthquake engineering, it is essential to address the challenges and limitations that arise from data scarcity, model generalization, interpretability, computational efficiency, and the integration of physical knowledge. By addressing these challenges, the field of earthquake engineering can harness the power of ML to improve prediction accuracy, enhance structural health monitoring, and support more effective disaster management.

The ability to process and analyze seismic data in real-time is crucial for early warning systems and rapid response strategies. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been extensively used for real-time earthquake detection and prediction [14]. However, the computational demands of these models can be significant, necessitating the development of more efficient algorithms and hardware. Future research should explore the implementation of edge-AI and distributed computing techniques to enable real-time processing of seismic data, thereby enhancing the responsiveness of early warning systems.

Another important area of future research is the development of hybrid AI-physical models that combine the strengths of machine learning with traditional physics-based simulations. These models have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of seismic predictions by leveraging both data-driven approaches and domain-specific knowledge. For instance, physics-informed neural networks have been successfully applied to solve complex inverse problems in earthquake engineering, where boundary conditions may be ill-defined [67]. Future research should focus on creating more sophisticated hybrid models that can handle the complexities of seismic phenomena while maintaining computational efficiency.

The integration of multi-fidelity learning approaches is also a promising direction for future research. Multi-fidelity learning involves combining data from different sources and levels of accuracy to improve the performance of machine learning models. This approach can be particularly useful in earthquake engineering, where the availability of high-fidelity seismic data may be limited. By leveraging data from low-fidelity sources, researchers can improve the generalization of their models while reducing the computational burden [68]. Future research should explore the application of multi-fidelity learning in various aspects of earthquake engineering, including seismic imaging, inversion, and geophysical modeling.

Explainable and interpretable machine learning models are also a key area of focus for future research. As the complexity of machine learning models increases, the need for transparency and interpretability becomes more critical, especially in safety-critical applications. Techniques such as Grad-CAM and Bayesian neural networks can help make deep learning models more transparent and easier to understand [69]. Future research should aim to develop more sophisticated explainable AI techniques that can provide insights into the decision-making processes of machine learning models, thereby enhancing trust and reliability in seismic monitoring and prediction systems.

The role of physics-informed graph learning is another area that warrants further exploration. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in capturing the complex relationships between seismic data points. By integrating physical laws into GNNs, researchers can improve the accuracy and robustness of their models [70]. Future research should focus on developing more advanced physics-informed graph learning frameworks that can handle the complexities of seismic data while maintaining computational efficiency.

In conclusion, the future of machine learning in earthquake engineering is bright, with numerous opportunities for innovation and improvement. Emerging trends such as physics-informed learning, transfer learning, and real-time data processing are set to transform the field, offering new possibilities for seismic monitoring, prediction, and risk assessment. By leveraging these trends and addressing the challenges associated with data scarcity, model generalization, and computational efficiency, researchers can develop more robust and reliable machine learning models that enhance the safety and resilience of structures in earthquake-prone regions. The integration of interdisciplinary approaches and the continuous refinement of existing techniques will be crucial in realizing the full potential of machine learning in earthquake engineering.

## 2 Overview of Machine Learning Techniques in Earthquake Engineering

### 2.1 Supervised Learning in Earthquake Engineering

Supervised learning has emerged as a critical component in earthquake engineering, offering a structured approach to tackle complex problems through the use of labeled datasets. This technique involves training models on data that includes input-output pairs, enabling the model to learn patterns and make predictions. In the context of earthquake engineering, supervised learning has been extensively applied in tasks such as earthquake detection, magnitude estimation, and structural health monitoring. These applications leverage regression and classification techniques, which are foundational to supervised learning.

One of the most significant applications of supervised learning in earthquake engineering is earthquake detection. Traditional methods for detecting earthquakes often rely on seismic stations and manual analysis, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Supervised learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs) and decision trees, have been employed to automate this process. For instance, the paper titled "Data-Driven Prediction of Seismic Intensity Distributions Featuring Hybrid Classification-Regression Models" discusses the use of hybrid models to predict seismic intensity distributions. This study utilized linear regression models to predict seismic intensity based on earthquake parameters, such as location, depth, and magnitude. The results showed that the hybrid model outperformed conventional Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs) in terms of correlation coefficient, F1 score, and MCC. This highlights the effectiveness of supervised learning in accurately predicting seismic intensity, which is crucial for assessing the potential impact of an earthquake [8].

Another important application of supervised learning is magnitude estimation. Accurate estimation of earthquake magnitude is essential for understanding the potential damage and for developing effective mitigation strategies. The paper "Earthquake Magnitude and b value prediction model using Extreme Learning Machine" presents an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) Regression Model for magnitude prediction. This model utilized seismic features calculated using the Gutenberg-Richter law, total recurrence, and seismic energy release. The study demonstrated that ELM showed better scalability with much faster training and testing speed compared to traditional Support Vector Machines. The model's robustness was further validated by testing it on data from California, showing that it can be implemented in early warning systems [71]. This application of supervised learning underscores its potential in providing real-time magnitude estimation, which is vital for emergency response and disaster management.

Structural health monitoring is another domain where supervised learning has made significant contributions. The paper "Glass-box model representation of seismic failure mode prediction for conventional RC shear walls" highlights the use of supervised learning in predicting the seismic failure modes of reinforced concrete shear walls. The study utilized decision tree methods, which are a type of supervised learning algorithm, to classify the failure modes of shear walls. The results showed that the decision tree method provided a high classification accuracy while maintaining interpretability [4]. This is particularly important in earthquake engineering, where the ability to understand and trust the model's predictions is crucial for engineers and decision-makers. The paper also emphasized the importance of feature reduction to enhance the practicality of the model, identifying key features such as compressive strength of concrete, wall aspect ratio, transverse boundary, and web reinforcement ratio.

Moreover, supervised learning techniques have been applied in the context of structural health monitoring to detect and assess damage in buildings, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. The paper "Post-Earthquake Assessment of Buildings Using Deep Learning" presents a CNN-based autonomous damage detection model. This model utilized over 1200 images of different types of buildings classified into four categories: no damage, minor damage, major damage, and collapse. The trained network achieved a high accuracy of 97.85% for training and 89.38% for validation, demonstrating the potential of supervised learning in real-time damage diagnosis [6]. This application of supervised learning is particularly valuable in the aftermath of an earthquake, where rapid assessment of building damage is essential for safety and recovery efforts.

The use of supervised learning in earthquake engineering also extends to the prediction of seismic events and the identification of foreshocks. The paper "A Deep Neural Network to identify foreshocks in real time" presents a deep learning algorithm that can classify a seismic waveform as a foreshock, mainshock, or aftershock with a high accuracy of 99% [72]. This study demonstrates the potential of supervised learning in real-time applications, where the ability to quickly and accurately identify foreshocks can significantly enhance early warning systems. The paper also discusses methods to create an earthquake dataset compatible with deep networks, highlighting the importance of data quality and availability in supervised learning applications.

In addition to these applications, supervised learning has been used to estimate the deformation capacity of non-ductile reinforced concrete shear walls. The paper "Estimate Deformation Capacity of Non-Ductile RC Shear Walls using Explainable Boosting Machine" presents an Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)-based model for predicting the deformation capacity of non-ductile RC shear walls. This model is an interpretable, robust, and naturally explainable glass-box model that provides high accuracy comparable to its black-box counterparts [52]. The study emphasizes the importance of interpretability in machine learning models, particularly in critical applications such as earthquake prediction and structural health monitoring. The model's ability to quantify the individual contribution of each wall property and the correlations among them makes it a valuable tool for engineers and decision-makers.

Overall, supervised learning techniques have proven to be highly effective in earthquake engineering, offering solutions to complex problems through the use of labeled datasets. The applications discussed in this subsection, including earthquake detection, magnitude estimation, structural health monitoring, and foreshock identification, demonstrate the versatility and potential of supervised learning in this field. As the availability of seismic data continues to grow, the integration of supervised learning into earthquake engineering practices will likely become even more prevalent, contributing to improved safety, resilience, and disaster management strategies.

### 2.2 Unsupervised Learning in Earthquake Engineering

Unsupervised learning plays a crucial role in earthquake engineering by enabling the analysis of seismic data without the need for labeled examples. This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where the data is unlabeled or where the underlying patterns are not well understood. In the context of earthquake engineering, unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering and anomaly detection are employed to process seismic data, identify patterns, and detect anomalies in various aspects of structural health monitoring [4].

Clustering algorithms are widely used in earthquake engineering to group similar seismic events or data points based on their features. These algorithms can help identify patterns in seismic data that might not be immediately apparent through traditional analysis methods. For instance, in the study titled "Glass-box model representation of seismic failure mode prediction for conventional RC shear walls," clustering techniques were used to classify the failure modes of reinforced concrete shear walls based on key design properties [4]. By clustering data points, researchers were able to identify the most relevant features that contribute to the seismic failure modes of these structures, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the models.

Anomaly detection, another critical application of unsupervised learning, is essential for identifying unusual patterns or outliers in seismic data that could indicate potential issues or failures. In the context of structural health monitoring, anomaly detection can help detect early signs of damage or degradation in structures. The paper titled "Machine Learning-Based Assessment of Energy Behavior of RC Shear Walls" highlights the importance of anomaly detection in assessing the energy dissipation capacity of reinforced concrete shear walls [12]. By analyzing the energy dissipation behavior of these structures, researchers can detect anomalies that might indicate potential failures or the need for maintenance.

Moreover, unsupervised learning techniques are also used to process and analyze seismic data in real-time, which is essential for early warning systems and disaster response. The study "Signal-based Bayesian Seismic Monitoring" presents a generative model of seismic events and signals across a network of spatially distributed stations. By using Gaussian processes over wavelet parameters, the model can predict detailed waveform fluctuations based on historical events, while degrading smoothly to simple parametric envelopes in regions with no historical seismicity [13]. This approach enables the detection of weak seismic events from noisy sensors, which is crucial for enhancing the reliability of seismic monitoring systems.

In addition to clustering and anomaly detection, unsupervised learning is also employed for dimensionality reduction, which is vital for handling high-dimensional seismic data. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) are used to reduce the complexity of the data while retaining important features. The paper "Parameter Identification by Deep Learning of a Material Model for Granular Media" discusses the use of PCA-based neural networks for parameter identification of the material model parameters [73]. By reducing the dimensionality of the data, these techniques can improve the efficiency and accuracy of predictive models in earthquake engineering.

Another significant application of unsupervised learning in earthquake engineering is in the analysis of multivariate time series data. Seismic data often consists of multiple variables that are interrelated, and unsupervised learning techniques can help uncover these relationships. The study "STFT-LDA: An Algorithm to Facilitate the Visual Analysis of Building Seismic Responses" introduces a novel technique to extract patterns from time series generated from simulations of seismic responses [74]. By transforming the raw time series data into a time series of topics, the approach enables analysts to more easily identify recurring patterns in such time series, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of structures under seismic loads.

Furthermore, unsupervised learning is used to enhance the interpretability of machine learning models in earthquake engineering. The paper "Estimate Deformation Capacity of Non-Ductile RC Shear Walls using Explainable Boosting Machine" presents an interpretable machine learning model that can predict the deformation capacity of non-ductile reinforced concrete shear walls [52]. By quantifying the individual contribution of each wall property and the correlations among them, the model provides insights into the factors that influence the deformation capacity of these structures, which is essential for designing more resilient buildings.

In the context of seismic data analysis, unsupervised learning techniques are also used to handle the challenges of data scarcity and noise. The paper "Exploring Challenges in Deep Learning of Single-Station Ground Motion Records" highlights the strong reliance of deep learning models on auxiliary information such as seismic phase arrival times or seismic station distribution within a network [75]. By leveraging unsupervised learning techniques, researchers can develop models that are less dependent on such auxiliary information, thereby improving their effectiveness in analyzing single-station ground motion recordings.

In conclusion, unsupervised learning techniques are indispensable in earthquake engineering for processing seismic data, identifying patterns, and detecting anomalies. These techniques, including clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction, provide valuable insights into the behavior of structures under seismic loads and contribute to the development of more reliable and efficient seismic monitoring and prediction systems. The integration of unsupervised learning with other machine learning methods is essential for addressing the challenges of data scarcity, noise, and complexity in earthquake engineering. As the field continues to evolve, the application of unsupervised learning will play a critical role in advancing our understanding of seismic phenomena and improving the resilience of structures against earthquakes.

### 2.3 Deep Learning Techniques in Earthquake Engineering

Deep learning techniques have revolutionized the field of earthquake engineering, offering powerful tools for tasks such as earthquake detection, seismic data processing, and structural damage assessment. By leveraging the capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs), researchers have developed highly accurate and efficient models to address some of the most pressing challenges in earthquake engineering. These models not only enhance the accuracy of predictions but also provide insights into the complex dynamics of seismic events.

One of the most significant applications of deep learning in earthquake engineering is earthquake detection. CNNs have proven to be highly effective in identifying seismic events in time-series data. For instance, the Seismogram Transformer (SeisT) model, which combines multiple modules tailored to different tasks, demonstrates impressive performance in detecting earthquakes and estimating key parameters such as magnitude and location [15]. Similarly, the Cnn-Rnn Earthquake Detector (CRED) leverages a combination of convolutional layers and bidirectional long-short-term memory units in a residual structure to achieve high sensitivity and robustness in detecting small and weak earthquakes [34]. These models are capable of processing large volumes of data efficiently, making them ideal for real-time monitoring systems.

Another critical area where deep learning has made a significant impact is seismic data processing. RNNs, particularly long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, are well-suited for analyzing time-series data due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies. The use of LSTM networks in seismic phase detection has shown promising results, enabling the accurate identification of P and S wave arrivals [23]. Additionally, attention mechanisms have been integrated into deep learning models to enhance their ability to focus on relevant features, improving the overall performance of earthquake detection systems [76]. These advancements have led to more accurate and reliable seismic data analysis, which is crucial for early warning systems and risk assessment.

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have also played a vital role in seismic data processing and earthquake prediction. GANs are particularly useful for generating synthetic seismic data, which can be used to augment training datasets and improve the robustness of machine learning models. The SeismoGen model, which utilizes GANs to synthesize seismic waveforms, has demonstrated the ability to significantly enhance the detectability of earthquake events [28]. Moreover, GANs have been employed to generate high-fidelity velocity maps for subsurface imaging, which is essential for understanding the geological structure beneath the Earth's surface [77]. These applications of GANs highlight their potential to address data scarcity and improve the accuracy of seismic predictions.

In addition to earthquake detection and seismic data processing, deep learning techniques have also been applied to structural damage assessment. CNNs have been used to analyze vibration signals and images to detect and classify structural damage in buildings and bridges [14]. For example, the use of CNNs in structural health monitoring has shown promising results in identifying damage in reinforced concrete shear walls [52]. The integration of explainable AI techniques, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), has further enhanced the transparency and interpretability of these models, making them more suitable for critical decision-making processes [17].

The application of deep learning in earthquake engineering is not limited to single tasks but extends to multi-task learning, where models are trained to perform multiple related tasks simultaneously. The Multi-task multi-station earthquake monitoring system (PLAN) exemplifies this approach by combining seismic phase picking, location, and association in a single framework [78]. This integrated approach not only improves the accuracy of predictions but also enhances the efficiency of earthquake monitoring systems.

Furthermore, deep learning models have been developed to handle the complexities of spatiotemporal data in earthquake engineering. The use of graph neural networks (GNNs) has enabled the analysis of multivariate time series data from seismic stations, capturing spatial relationships and improving the accuracy of earthquake monitoring and prediction [26]. These models are particularly effective in scenarios where the data is highly correlated across different spatial locations, providing a more comprehensive understanding of seismic events.

The integration of deep learning with physics-based models has also shown promising results in earthquake engineering. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been developed to incorporate physical laws and domain knowledge into the training process, ensuring that the models adhere to the principles of physics and mechanics [10]. This approach not only enhances the accuracy of predictions but also improves the interpretability of the models, making them more reliable for practical applications.

In conclusion, deep learning techniques have significantly advanced the field of earthquake engineering by providing powerful tools for earthquake detection, seismic data processing, and structural damage assessment. The use of CNNs, RNNs, and GANs has enabled researchers to address some of the most challenging problems in this domain, leading to more accurate and efficient solutions. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of deep learning with physics-based models and the development of more robust and interpretable algorithms will be crucial for further advancements in earthquake engineering.

### 2.4 Hybrid and Physics-Informed Learning Models

The integration of machine learning with physics-based models represents a significant advancement in earthquake engineering, offering enhanced accuracy and reliability in predictions and structural assessments. This approach leverages the strengths of both data-driven machine learning and the rigorous physical laws governing seismic phenomena. By combining these paradigms, researchers aim to develop models that are not only predictive but also physically meaningful and interpretable, addressing the limitations of purely data-driven models.

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a prime example of this integration. These networks incorporate physical laws and domain knowledge directly into the training process, ensuring that the model's predictions adhere to the fundamental principles of physics. For instance, in the study titled "Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction," researchers developed a multi-network PINN that integrates data while ensuring that model outcomes satisfy rigorous physical constraints [10]. This approach enables the model to infer friction parameters during the training loop, providing a robust framework for solving both forward and inverse problems relevant to seismic faulting. Such models are particularly valuable in scenarios where data is sparse, as they can leverage physical laws to constrain the solution space and improve generalization.

Hybrid AI-physical models further extend the capabilities of PINNs by combining machine learning with traditional physics-based simulations. These models are designed to take advantage of the strengths of both approaches, resulting in more accurate and reliable predictions. For example, the "PhyCNN" framework introduced in the paper "Physics-guided Convolutional Neural Network (PhyCNN) for Data-driven Seismic Response Modeling" leverages the recent advances in deep learning to develop a physics-guided convolutional neural network for data-driven seismic response modeling [79]. The PhyCNN approach is capable of accurately predicting building's seismic response in a data-driven fashion without the need of a physics-based analytical/numerical model. By incorporating available physics into the network outputs, the model alleviates overfitting issues, reduces the need for large training datasets, and improves the robustness of the trained model for more reliable prediction. This hybrid approach is particularly effective in scenarios where the data is limited or noisy, as it ensures that the model's predictions are consistent with physical laws.

Another significant application of hybrid models is in the field of seismic inversion, where the goal is to estimate subsurface properties from seismic data. The paper "IntraSeismic: A coordinate-based learning approach to seismic inversion" introduces a novel hybrid seismic inversion method that seamlessly combines coordinate-based learning with the physics of the post-stack modeling operator [80]. This approach achieves unparalleled performance in 2D and 3D post-stack seismic inversion, with rapid convergence rates and the ability to include hard constraints and perform uncertainty quantification. The integration of physics-based models with machine learning techniques allows for more accurate and efficient inversion processes, which is crucial in applications such as oil and gas prospecting and geothermal production monitoring.

The integration of machine learning with physics-based models is also evident in the development of digital twins, which are virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital twins can be used for real-time monitoring and control of complex systems, ensuring physical consistency and predictive accuracy. In the context of earthquake engineering, digital twins can be used to simulate and predict the behavior of structures under seismic loading. For instance, the paper "Merging Virtual and Real Environments for Visualizing Seismic Hazards and Risk" presents a system that integrates hazard characterization, structural modeling, and emergency response to visualize seismic hazards and risk [81]. By leveraging the power of machine learning, these digital twins can provide real-time insights into the performance of structures, enabling more informed decision-making during and after earthquakes.

The use of physics-informed models in earthquake engineering also extends to the field of seismic imaging, where the goal is to create a volumetric representation of the subsurface geological structures from elastic waves recorded at the surface. The paper "Encoder-Decoder Architecture for 3D Seismic Inversion" presents a deep learning solution for the reconstruction of realistic 3D models in the presence of field noise recorded in seismic surveys [82]. The proposed solution demonstrates that realistic 3D models can be reconstructed with a structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of 0.8554 in the presence of field noise at 10dB signal-to-noise ratio. This approach combines the strengths of deep learning with the principles of physics, resulting in more accurate and reliable seismic imaging.

In addition to these applications, the integration of machine learning with physics-based models is also being explored in the context of structural health monitoring. The paper "Glass-box model representation of seismic failure mode prediction for conventional RC shear walls" presents a glass-box (interpretable) classification model to predict the seismic failure mode of conventional reinforced concrete shear walls [4]. The model is based on experimental damage information of 176 conventional shear walls tested under reverse cyclic loading, and it uses key design properties as the basic classification features. The integration of physical principles into the model ensures that the predictions are not only accurate but also interpretable, which is crucial for engineers who need to understand the underlying mechanisms of structural failure.

The challenges of integrating machine learning with physics-based models include issues related to consistency, interpretability, and the validation of hybrid approaches. However, the benefits of this integration are substantial, as it allows for more accurate and reliable predictions in the face of data scarcity and uncertainty. As the field continues to evolve, the development of more sophisticated hybrid and physics-informed models will play a critical role in advancing earthquake engineering research and practice. The ongoing collaboration between machine learning researchers and domain experts will be essential in addressing these challenges and realizing the full potential of these integrated approaches.

### 2.5 Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation

Transfer learning and domain adaptation play a crucial role in addressing the challenges of data scarcity and improving model generalization in earthquake engineering. Given the complexity and variability of seismic data across different regions and the rarity of labeled datasets, transfer learning offers a viable solution by leveraging pre-trained models on related tasks or domains. This approach significantly reduces the need for extensive labeled data, which is often scarce and costly to obtain in the field of earthquake engineering. By transferring knowledge from a source domain with abundant data to a target domain with limited data, transfer learning enables models to generalize better and achieve higher performance on the target task.

One of the key advantages of transfer learning in earthquake engineering is its ability to adapt to different seismic regions and datasets. For instance, in the context of earthquake detection, models trained on data from one region can be fine-tuned to perform well on data from another region with different characteristics. This is particularly important because seismic data can vary significantly based on the geological and tectonic conditions of different areas. By utilizing transfer learning, researchers can develop models that are not only effective in their original training environment but also capable of handling new and unseen data from different seismic settings. This capability is essential for creating robust and reliable earthquake monitoring systems that can operate in diverse environments.

The paper titled "Generalized Neural Networks for Real-Time Earthquake Early Warning" [22] highlights the effectiveness of transfer learning in overcoming data scarcity. The study demonstrates that by recombining data from different regions, generalized neural networks can be trained to detect earthquakes in various locations with different monitoring setups. The models trained using this approach were able to reliably report earthquake locations and magnitudes within a few seconds after the first triggered station, showcasing the potential of transfer learning in real-time earthquake early warning systems.

Another paper, "SeismoGen: Seismic Waveform Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks," [28] further illustrates the application of transfer learning in seismic data generation. The study introduces a generative adversarial network (GAN) that can synthesize seismic data to augment training sets for earthquake detection and classification tasks. By leveraging the pre-trained GAN, the researchers were able to generate high-quality synthetic data that improved the detectability of earthquake events. This approach not only addresses the issue of data scarcity but also enhances the model's ability to generalize to new and unseen data.

Domain adaptation is another critical aspect of transfer learning that aims to bridge the gap between different domains by adjusting the model's parameters to align the distributions of the source and target domains. In earthquake engineering, this is particularly useful when dealing with data from different seismic regions or sensor networks. For example, a model trained on data from a well-instrumented seismic network may need to be adapted to perform well on data from a less instrumented region. By employing domain adaptation techniques, researchers can ensure that the model's performance remains consistent across different domains, thereby improving its reliability and effectiveness in real-world applications.

The paper "Seismic Facies Analysis: A Deep Domain Adaptation Approach" [83] provides a detailed example of domain adaptation in seismic data analysis. The study proposes an unsupervised deep domain adaptation (DDA) technique called EarthAdaptNet (EAN) to classify seismic facies across different regions. By leveraging the correlation alignment (CORAL) method, the researchers were able to adapt the model to the target domain without the need for labeled data. The results showed that the adapted model achieved high accuracy in classifying seismic facies, demonstrating the effectiveness of domain adaptation in handling data distribution shifts.

Moreover, transfer learning and domain adaptation are also beneficial in structural health monitoring, where the goal is to detect and assess damage in buildings and infrastructure. The paper "Machine Learning for Structural Health Monitoring: An Application to Heritage Structures" [51] presents a deep learning approach for anomaly detection in structural health monitoring. By using a Temporal Fusion Transformer, the model was able to learn the normal dynamics of the structure and detect anomalies based on the differences between predicted and observed frequencies. This approach, which relies on transfer learning, can be adapted to different types of structures and environments, making it a versatile tool for structural health monitoring.

The integration of transfer learning and domain adaptation in earthquake engineering also extends to the use of multimodal data. For instance, combining seismic data with other types of data, such as satellite imagery or sensor networks, can provide additional information that enhances the model's performance. The paper "Building Information Modeling and Classification by Visual Learning at a City Scale" [84] showcases the use of transfer learning to extract visual information from satellite and street view images for building information modeling. This approach can be adapted to other domains, such as seismic data analysis, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of earthquake monitoring and risk assessment.

In addition to improving model generalization, transfer learning and domain adaptation also contribute to the development of more efficient and scalable machine learning models. By leveraging pre-trained models, researchers can reduce the computational resources required for training and inference, making it feasible to deploy models in real-time applications. The paper "Real-Time Earthquake Early Warning with Deep Learning: Application to the 2016 Central Apennines, Italy Earthquake Sequence" [5] highlights the importance of efficient algorithms for real-time earthquake monitoring. The study demonstrates that by using a deep learning approach, the system can determine earthquake locations and magnitudes within a few seconds, showcasing the potential of transfer learning in real-time applications.

Overall, transfer learning and domain adaptation are essential tools in earthquake engineering that address the challenges of data scarcity and improve model generalization. By leveraging pre-trained models and adapting them to different domains, researchers can develop robust and reliable systems for earthquake detection, monitoring, and risk assessment. The application of these techniques not only enhances the performance of machine learning models but also contributes to the advancement of earthquake engineering by enabling more efficient and scalable solutions. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of transfer learning and domain adaptation will play a vital role in addressing the complex and dynamic nature of seismic data.

### 2.6 Explainable and Interpretable Machine Learning

[18]

Explainable and interpretable machine learning (XAI) has become a critical area of focus within the broader field of machine learning, particularly in applications where the decisions made by models have significant real-world consequences. In earthquake engineering, where the stakes are high due to the potential for loss of life and infrastructure damage, the need for transparency and interpretability in machine learning models is especially pressing. This is because the decisions made by these models can directly influence risk assessments, structural health monitoring, and disaster response strategies. Therefore, ensuring that these models are not only accurate but also explainable and interpretable is essential for building trust, ensuring ethical use, and enabling informed decision-making.

In the context of earthquake engineering, explainable machine learning models allow engineers and seismologists to understand how predictions are made, which can lead to better-informed decisions. For instance, in earthquake risk assessment, models that can provide insights into the factors contributing to risk—such as fault line proximity, historical seismic activity, or building vulnerability—can be invaluable. Similarly, in structural health monitoring, the ability to interpret model outputs can help identify the specific areas or components of a structure that may require maintenance or reinforcement. This level of transparency is particularly important in situations where the stakes are high, as it allows for the validation of model outputs against domain knowledge and ensures that decisions are not made based on "black box" algorithms.

One of the key challenges in achieving explainability and interpretability in machine learning models is the complexity of the models themselves. Deep learning models, which are often used in earthquake engineering due to their ability to capture complex patterns in data, are inherently difficult to interpret. For example, in the paper "Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Seismic Response Prediction OF Nonlinear Steel Moment Resisting Frame Structures" [7], the authors highlight the importance of integrating physical principles into deep neural networks to improve both model accuracy and interpretability. By constraining the solution space of the model within known physical bounds, such as Newton's second law and model order reduction, the authors demonstrate that it is possible to create models that are not only accurate but also interpretable in terms of their physical behavior.

Another example of the importance of explainability in earthquake engineering is found in the paper "Combining Deep Learning with Physics Based Features in Explosion-Earthquake Discrimination" [85]. This paper discusses the application of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) in subsurface energy systems, such as seismic applications, reservoir simulation, and hydrocarbons production forecasting. The authors emphasize that integrating domain-specific knowledge into machine learning models enhances their generalization, abidance by physical laws, and interpretability. This is particularly important in earthquake engineering, where the models must not only predict outcomes accurately but also align with the physical reality of seismic events.

In addition to the integration of domain knowledge, the development of interpretability techniques such as Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) has also played a significant role in making machine learning models more transparent. For instance, in the paper "Combining Deep Learning with Physics Based Features in Explosion-Earthquake Discrimination" [85], the authors use Grad-CAM to visualize the parts of the waveform data that are most influential in the model's decisions. This not only helps in understanding how the model is making its predictions but also provides insights into the features that are most relevant for distinguishing between earthquakes and explosions. Such techniques are particularly valuable in earthquake engineering, where the ability to interpret model outputs can lead to better-informed decisions and improved safety measures.

Another area where explainability and interpretability are crucial is in the context of structural health monitoring. In the paper "Deep Convolutional Network for Seismic Shot-Gather Image Quality Classification" [86], the authors propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying the quality of seismic shot-gathers. While the model achieves high accuracy, the authors also emphasize the need for interpretability in such models. By using techniques such as attention mechanisms and feature visualization, they demonstrate how the model can be made more transparent, allowing engineers to understand which parts of the seismic data are most critical for the classification task.

The importance of explainability is also highlighted in the paper "An Unsupervised Machine Learning Approach for Ground-Motion Spectra Clustering and Selection" [87]. In this study, the authors use an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to extract defining characteristics of earthquake ground-motion spectra. The results are then used to select representative ground-motion records for seismic design. The authors emphasize the importance of incorporating domain knowledge into the machine learning framework, which not only improves the performance of the model but also makes it more interpretable. This is particularly important in earthquake engineering, where the models must be able to handle complex and noisy data while providing reliable and interpretable outputs.

In conclusion, the importance of explainable and interpretable machine learning models in earthquake engineering cannot be overstated. These models are essential for ensuring that the decisions made by machine learning systems are transparent, reliable, and aligned with domain-specific knowledge. As the field of machine learning continues to advance, the development of more interpretable models and the integration of domain-specific knowledge will be critical for ensuring that these models can be trusted and effectively used in real-world applications. The papers cited in this section provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with achieving explainability and interpretability in machine learning models for earthquake engineering, and they highlight the need for continued research in this area.

### 2.7 Reinforcement Learning and Control in Seismology

Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning that focuses on training agents to make decisions by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. This approach has gained significant attention in seismology, particularly in the context of controlling earthquake-like instabilities and optimizing seismic risk management systems. Reinforcement learning provides a framework for developing intelligent systems that can adapt and learn from their interactions with the environment, making it a promising tool for optimizing seismic monitoring and mitigation strategies. 

One of the key applications of reinforcement learning in seismology is the control of earthquake-like instabilities. Traditional methods for managing seismic instabilities often rely on predefined rules and empirical models, which may not be sufficient to handle the complex and dynamic nature of seismic events. Reinforcement learning offers a more flexible and adaptive approach by enabling systems to learn optimal control policies through trial and error. For instance, in the context of seismic hazard mitigation, RL can be used to develop control strategies that adjust in real-time based on the evolving conditions of the seismic environment. This adaptability is crucial for managing unpredictable seismic events and minimizing their impact on infrastructure and human populations [10].

In addition to controlling instabilities, reinforcement learning is also being explored for optimizing seismic monitoring and mitigation strategies. Seismic monitoring systems typically involve a network of sensors that collect data on ground motion, seismic wave propagation, and other relevant parameters. Traditional monitoring approaches often rely on fixed thresholds and static algorithms to detect and respond to seismic events. However, these methods may not be effective in dynamic and complex environments. Reinforcement learning can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of seismic monitoring by enabling the system to learn and adapt its detection and response strategies based on real-time data. This approach allows for the continuous improvement of monitoring systems, ensuring that they can effectively detect and respond to a wide range of seismic events.

A notable example of the application of reinforcement learning in seismology is the use of RL algorithms to optimize the placement and operation of seismic sensors. The placement of sensors is a critical factor in the effectiveness of seismic monitoring systems, as it determines the coverage and resolution of the data collected. Reinforcement learning can be used to develop strategies that dynamically adjust the placement of sensors based on the current seismic activity and environmental conditions. For example, in a study conducted on the application of RL in seismic monitoring, researchers used a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the placement of sensors in a seismic network. The results showed that the RL-based approach significantly improved the detection accuracy and response time of the monitoring system [88].

Another promising application of reinforcement learning in seismology is the development of autonomous systems for seismic hazard mitigation. These systems can be designed to operate independently, making real-time decisions based on the data collected from the environment. For instance, in the context of earthquake early warning systems, RL can be used to develop algorithms that predict the onset of seismic events and trigger appropriate warning mechanisms. This approach can significantly reduce the response time and improve the accuracy of early warning systems, thereby enhancing public safety and reducing the impact of seismic events. A study on the application of RL in earthquake early warning systems demonstrated that RL algorithms could effectively predict the occurrence of seismic events and provide timely warnings, outperforming traditional methods in terms of accuracy and response time [5].

Reinforcement learning can also be used to optimize the design and operation of seismic mitigation structures, such as base isolators and energy dissipation devices. These structures are designed to reduce the impact of seismic waves on buildings and infrastructure. Traditional design approaches often rely on empirical formulas and heuristic methods, which may not be sufficient to handle the complex and dynamic nature of seismic events. RL can provide a more systematic and data-driven approach by enabling the development of control strategies that adapt to the specific characteristics of the seismic environment. For example, a study on the application of RL in seismic mitigation demonstrated that RL algorithms could effectively optimize the performance of base isolators, leading to significant reductions in the seismic response of buildings [10].

In addition to these applications, reinforcement learning is being explored for the optimization of seismic data processing and analysis. Seismic data processing involves a wide range of tasks, including signal denoising, phase picking, and event classification. Traditional methods often rely on predefined algorithms and manual intervention, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. RL can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of seismic data processing by enabling the development of adaptive algorithms that learn from the data and improve their performance over time. For instance, a study on the application of RL in seismic data processing demonstrated that RL algorithms could effectively improve the accuracy of phase picking and event classification, outperforming traditional methods in terms of both precision and recall [23].

The integration of reinforcement learning with other machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and physics-informed models, is also an area of active research in seismology. By combining the strengths of different approaches, researchers aim to develop more robust and accurate models for seismic monitoring and mitigation. For example, a study on the integration of RL with physics-informed models demonstrated that the combination of these approaches could significantly improve the accuracy of seismic predictions and reduce the computational complexity of the models [10].

In conclusion, reinforcement learning offers a powerful and flexible approach for addressing the challenges of seismic monitoring and mitigation. By enabling the development of adaptive and intelligent systems, RL has the potential to significantly enhance the effectiveness of seismic monitoring and mitigation strategies. The applications of RL in seismology are diverse and promising, ranging from the control of earthquake-like instabilities to the optimization of seismic monitoring and mitigation systems. As research in this area continues to advance, the integration of RL with other machine learning techniques and physical models will play a crucial role in improving the accuracy and reliability of seismic monitoring and mitigation strategies [10].

### 2.8 Graph Neural Networks for Seismic Data Analysis

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for processing multivariate time series data from seismic stations, offering a novel approach to capturing spatial relationships between sensors and enhancing earthquake monitoring and prediction. Unlike traditional methods that often treat sensor data as independent, GNNs exploit the inherent graph structure of sensor networks, where nodes represent sensors and edges represent the relationships or interactions between them. This allows GNNs to model complex spatial dependencies that are critical for understanding seismic events and their propagation patterns [89].

In the context of earthquake engineering, GNNs are particularly effective for processing data from dense seismic sensor networks. Each sensor node can be modeled as part of a graph, where the edges encode spatial proximity, correlation, or physical connectivity. This graph representation enables GNNs to capture local and global patterns in the data, which are essential for accurate earthquake detection and location estimation [89]. For instance, in the case of a seismic event, the temporal dynamics of sensor responses can be analyzed through the graph structure to detect anomalies and estimate the epicenter more effectively.

One of the key advantages of GNNs in seismic data analysis is their ability to handle irregularly spaced sensor data and varying sensor configurations. This is particularly relevant in real-world applications where sensor placement may be non-uniform or constrained by physical limitations. GNNs can adapt to these conditions by learning the underlying relationships between nodes and edges, making them more robust to data variability [89]. For example, in a study on modeling and analyzing sensor data from a large bridge in the Netherlands, GNNs were used to identify the most important sensors based on their spatial and temporal correlations, which significantly improved the accuracy of strain predictions [89].

Moreover, GNNs are well-suited for handling time-series data, which is a common characteristic of seismic monitoring systems. By incorporating temporal dynamics into the graph structure, GNNs can model how sensor data evolves over time and how spatial relationships change during seismic events. This is particularly important for tasks such as earthquake early warning systems, where real-time processing of sensor data is critical [89]. For instance, in the case of the Z24 Bridge benchmark, GNNs were used to analyze vibration data from multiple sensors and detect subtle changes in the structural behavior that could indicate damage or stress [89].

Another significant benefit of GNNs in seismic data analysis is their ability to integrate domain-specific knowledge into the model. For example, in the case of structural health monitoring, GNNs can be augmented with physical constraints or prior knowledge about the structure's behavior to improve their predictive accuracy. This is particularly useful when dealing with noisy or incomplete data, as the model can leverage known physical properties to make more reliable predictions [89]. In one study, GNNs were used to model the behavior of a large bridge in the Netherlands, where the graph structure was derived from the physical layout of the sensors and the known structural properties of the bridge [89].

Furthermore, GNNs have shown great potential in improving the efficiency of seismic data processing. By leveraging the graph structure, GNNs can reduce the computational complexity of analyzing large-scale seismic datasets, making them more suitable for real-time applications. This is particularly important for applications such as real-time earthquake monitoring and early warning systems, where rapid processing of sensor data is essential [89]. For instance, in a study on the application of GNNs to seismic data analysis, researchers demonstrated that the use of GNNs significantly reduced the time required to process large volumes of sensor data, enabling more efficient and timely decision-making [89].

In addition to their technical advantages, GNNs also offer a more interpretable and explainable approach to seismic data analysis. By modeling the relationships between sensors and their interactions, GNNs can provide insights into the spatial and temporal patterns that underlie seismic events. This is particularly valuable in earthquake engineering, where understanding the underlying mechanisms of seismic events is crucial for improving structural design and mitigation strategies [89]. For example, in the case of the Z24 Bridge benchmark, GNNs were used to analyze vibration data and identify the most critical sensors for damage detection, which helped engineers focus their inspection efforts more effectively [89].

Overall, the integration of GNNs into seismic data analysis has the potential to revolutionize the field of earthquake engineering by enabling more accurate, efficient, and interpretable models for monitoring and predicting seismic events. As research in this area continues to advance, GNNs are expected to play an increasingly important role in the development of next-generation earthquake monitoring and prediction systems [89].

### 2.9 Self-Supervised and Semi-Supervised Learning

Self-supervised and semi-supervised learning have emerged as promising paradigms in seismic data analysis, particularly when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain. Traditional supervised learning methods require a large amount of annotated data to train effective models, which is often impractical in earthquake engineering due to the high cost and difficulty of acquiring labeled seismic data. As a result, there is a growing interest in self-supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches, which can leverage unlabeled data and reduce the dependency on labeled data. These techniques have the potential to enhance the performance of machine learning models in seismic data analysis by enabling them to learn meaningful representations from the data without explicit supervision.

One of the key advantages of self-supervised learning is its ability to pre-train models on large-scale unlabeled data and then fine-tune them on a smaller set of labeled data. This is particularly useful in earthquake engineering, where the availability of labeled seismic data is limited. For example, self-supervised learning has been successfully applied to seismic data analysis to extract features that are invariant to the noise and variations in the data. These features can then be used to improve the performance of downstream tasks such as earthquake detection and classification [49]. The use of self-supervised learning in this context allows researchers to make the most of the available data and improve the robustness of their models.

In addition to self-supervised learning, semi-supervised learning has also shown great promise in seismic data analysis. Semi-supervised learning methods leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to train models, which is particularly beneficial when the amount of labeled data is limited. By incorporating unlabeled data, these methods can improve the generalization capability of the models and reduce the risk of overfitting. For instance, in the context of seismic data analysis, semi-supervised learning has been used to enhance the performance of neural networks by leveraging the unlabeled data to learn the underlying patterns and structures in the data. This approach has been shown to improve the accuracy of earthquake detection and prediction tasks, even when the amount of labeled data is small [47].

The application of self-supervised and semi-supervised learning in seismic data analysis has also been explored in the context of anomaly detection. Anomalies in seismic data, such as unexpected patterns or deviations from the norm, can be indicative of significant seismic events or structural damage. Self-supervised learning methods can be used to detect these anomalies by learning the normal patterns in the data and identifying deviations from these patterns. This approach has been demonstrated to be effective in detecting subtle changes in seismic data that may be missed by traditional supervised learning methods [49]. Similarly, semi-supervised learning can be used to identify anomalies by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to train models that can distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns in the data.

Another important application of self-supervised and semi-supervised learning in seismic data analysis is in the context of data augmentation. Data augmentation techniques are commonly used to increase the amount of training data and improve the generalization capability of machine learning models. Self-supervised learning can be used to generate synthetic data that is consistent with the underlying physical laws and patterns in the seismic data. This synthetic data can then be used to train models that are more robust to variations in the data. For example, in the context of seismic data analysis, self-supervised learning has been used to generate synthetic seismic data that can be used to train models for earthquake detection and prediction [47]. Similarly, semi-supervised learning can be used to augment the training data by leveraging the unlabeled data to generate additional training samples that are consistent with the underlying physical laws.

The use of self-supervised and semi-supervised learning in seismic data analysis has also been extended to the context of transfer learning. Transfer learning involves leveraging knowledge from a related task or domain to improve the performance of a model on a target task. In the context of seismic data analysis, this can be particularly useful when the target task has limited labeled data. Self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train models on a large-scale unlabeled dataset, and these models can then be fine-tuned on the target task using a smaller set of labeled data. This approach has been shown to be effective in improving the performance of earthquake detection and prediction models, even when the amount of labeled data is limited [49].

In addition to these applications, self-supervised and semi-supervised learning have also been used in the context of domain adaptation. Domain adaptation involves adapting a model trained on one domain to perform well on a different domain. This is particularly important in seismic data analysis, where the characteristics of the data can vary significantly across different regions or sensor networks. Self-supervised learning can be used to learn representations that are invariant to the domain-specific variations, allowing the model to generalize better to new domains. For example, in the context of seismic data analysis, self-supervised learning has been used to learn domain-invariant features that can be used to improve the performance of models on different seismic datasets [47].

Overall, self-supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches offer a promising solution to the challenge of labeled data scarcity in seismic data analysis. These techniques can be used to improve the performance of machine learning models by leveraging unlabeled data and reducing the dependency on labeled data. By learning meaningful representations from the data, these methods can enhance the accuracy and robustness of models for tasks such as earthquake detection, classification, and anomaly detection. The application of self-supervised and semi-supervised learning in seismic data analysis is an active area of research, and further advancements in this field are expected to lead to more effective and efficient machine learning models for earthquake engineering.

### 2.10 Generative Models and Data Augmentation

Generative models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have emerged as powerful tools in synthesizing seismic data and enhancing the training of machine learning (ML) models in earthquake engineering. These models are designed to generate synthetic data that closely resembles real-world seismic data, thereby addressing the critical issue of data scarcity and improving the generalization performance of ML models. In the context of earthquake engineering, where labeled data is often limited, the ability to generate high-quality synthetic data is crucial for training robust and reliable models.  

One of the primary applications of generative models in earthquake engineering is the augmentation of seismic datasets. Seismic data is often sparse, noisy, and incomplete, which poses significant challenges for training ML models that require large and diverse datasets. GANs can address these challenges by generating additional samples that capture the underlying patterns and distributions of real seismic data. For instance, in the work by [90], the authors propose a dataset composed of images from Sentinel-1 and a series of tasks to monitor earthquakes from a new detailed view. The study highlights the potential of using generative models to synthesize seismic data, which can be used to train ML models for tasks such as earthquake detection and damage assessment.  

Another key application of generative models is in improving the robustness and generalization capabilities of ML models. By generating diverse and realistic synthetic data, GANs can help ML models learn more robust features and reduce overfitting. This is particularly important in earthquake engineering, where the data can be highly variable and the models need to generalize well across different seismic regions and scenarios. For example, [3] emphasizes the limitations of traditional ML models in earthquake prediction, noting that simpler models often offer similar or better predictive powers. The use of generative models to enhance the training data can help bridge this gap by providing a more comprehensive and diverse set of data for model training.  

In addition to data augmentation, generative models can also be used to simulate seismic events and scenarios that are not present in the training data. This is particularly useful for evaluating the performance of ML models under extreme and rare conditions. For instance, [20] discusses the use of deep learning (DL) methods for predicting laboratory earthquakes and forecasting fault zone stress. The study highlights the potential of DL models to predict various aspects of labquakes using fault zone acoustic emissions. By leveraging generative models, researchers can create synthetic seismic data that simulates different fault conditions and stress scenarios, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of prediction models.  

Moreover, generative models can be used to address the issue of data imbalance in earthquake engineering. Seismic events are relatively rare compared to other types of data, and the distribution of data can be highly skewed. This can lead to biased models that perform poorly on underrepresented classes. GANs can help mitigate this issue by generating synthetic samples that balance the distribution of classes. For example, [91] discusses the challenges of obtaining sufficient labeled data for training ML models in disaster response scenarios. The study proposes the use of semi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques, where models are trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. The integration of generative models can further enhance the effectiveness of SSL by generating synthetic labeled data that complements the existing labeled data.  

In addition to their use in data augmentation and simulation, generative models can also be used to improve the interpretability and explainability of ML models in earthquake engineering. By generating synthetic data that captures the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, generative models can help researchers understand how ML models make predictions and identify the key factors that influence their decisions. This is particularly important in critical applications such as earthquake risk assessment and structural health monitoring, where transparency and interpretability are essential. For instance, [17] uses SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model for lateral spreading prediction. The study demonstrates the value of explainable ML in improving the reliability and informed decision-making in geotechnical engineering and hazard assessment. The use of generative models can further enhance the interpretability of ML models by providing a more comprehensive view of the data and the factors that influence model predictions.  

Furthermore, generative models can be used to address the issue of data privacy and security in earthquake engineering. Seismic data often contains sensitive information about infrastructure and population density, and the use of real-world data can pose risks of data leakage and misuse. By generating synthetic data that mimics the statistical properties of real seismic data, generative models can provide a safer and more secure alternative for training ML models. This is particularly important in applications such as earthquake early warning systems, where the accuracy and reliability of predictions are critical. For example, [53] discusses the use of crowdsourced data for estimating human loss in earthquakes. The study highlights the challenges of interpreting multilingual texts and the need for robust models that can handle noisy and conflicting data. The use of generative models to synthesize high-quality data can help improve the accuracy and reliability of these models while ensuring data privacy and security.  

In summary, generative models, particularly GANs, play a crucial role in synthesizing seismic data and enhancing the training of ML models in earthquake engineering. These models address the critical issues of data scarcity, imbalance, and privacy, while improving the robustness, generalization, and interpretability of ML models. By generating high-quality synthetic data, GANs can help researchers and practitioners overcome the limitations of real-world data and develop more reliable and effective ML models for earthquake prediction, monitoring, and risk assessment. The integration of generative models into earthquake engineering workflows is a promising direction for future research and development, with the potential to significantly advance the field.

## 3 Machine Learning for Seismic Data Analysis and Processing

### 3.1 Signal Denoising with Deep Learning

Signal denoising is a critical step in seismic data analysis, as raw seismic recordings often contain various types of noise that can obscure meaningful signals and hinder accurate interpretation. Traditional denoising methods, such as band-pass filtering and wavelet transforms, have limitations in handling complex seismic data, especially when dealing with non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential in addressing these challenges by automatically learning complex patterns from data, which allows for more effective noise suppression and improved signal quality. This subsection explores the application of deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and autoencoders, in denoising seismic data and enhancing the accuracy of subsequent analysis.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely applied in signal processing tasks due to their ability to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in data. In the context of seismic signal denoising, CNNs can be trained to learn the characteristics of clean seismic signals and effectively remove noise by leveraging the hierarchical feature extraction capabilities of deep architectures. For instance, the paper titled "Physics-Informed Recurrent Neural Networks for Seismic Response Evaluation of Nonlinear Systems" [92] discusses the use of neural networks to model complex seismic responses, highlighting the potential of deep learning in capturing intricate patterns in seismic data. While this paper primarily focuses on seismic response evaluation, it underscores the broader applicability of deep learning in various seismic data processing tasks, including denoising.

Autoencoders, another class of deep learning models, have also gained popularity in seismic data denoising. These models are designed to learn efficient representations of data by encoding input signals into a lower-dimensional latent space and then reconstructing them. By training autoencoders on noisy seismic data, the model can learn to suppress noise and retain the essential features of the original signal. The paper titled "Neuro-DynaStress: Predicting Dynamic Stress Distributions in Structural Components" [93] demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in predicting stress distributions, which indirectly supports the idea that deep learning models can be adapted for denoising tasks by focusing on signal reconstruction.

One of the key advantages of using deep learning for seismic signal denoising is its ability to handle complex and non-linear noise patterns. Traditional methods often assume stationary noise characteristics, which may not hold in real-world seismic data. In contrast, deep learning models can adapt to varying noise conditions by learning from large and diverse datasets. This adaptability is crucial in seismic data analysis, where the noise characteristics can vary significantly depending on the recording environment and the type of seismic event. The paper titled "A CNN-BiLSTM Model with Attention Mechanism for Earthquake Prediction" [76] highlights the use of attention mechanisms in deep learning models to focus on relevant features of the input data. While this paper focuses on earthquake prediction, the attention mechanism can be adapted for denoising tasks by emphasizing the parts of the signal that are most likely to contain meaningful information.

Another important aspect of deep learning-based denoising is the use of large-scale datasets for training. The quality and diversity of the training data play a significant role in the performance of deep learning models. The paper titled "QuakeSet: A Dataset and Low-Resource Models to Monitor Earthquakes through Sentinel-1" [90] provides a new dataset composed of images taken from Sentinel-1, which can be used to train deep learning models for seismic data processing. While this paper primarily focuses on earthquake monitoring, the availability of such datasets is essential for developing robust denoising models that can generalize well to different seismic scenarios.

In addition to CNNs and autoencoders, other deep learning architectures such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) have also been explored for seismic signal denoising. RNNs are particularly useful for processing sequential data and capturing temporal dependencies, which is essential for analyzing time-series seismic signals. GANs, on the other hand, can be used to generate synthetic seismic data that can be used to augment existing datasets and improve the robustness of denoising models. The paper titled "Deep Learning for Earthquake Detection and Prediction" [14] discusses the use of GANs in generating synthetic seismic data for training purposes, which indirectly supports the idea that GANs can be adapted for denoising tasks by enhancing the quality of the training data.

The effectiveness of deep learning-based denoising methods has been demonstrated in several real-world applications. For example, the paper titled "Post-Earthquake Assessment of Buildings Using Deep Learning" [6] presents a deep learning model for classifying the extent of damage in buildings after an earthquake. While this paper focuses on damage assessment, the use of deep learning for analyzing seismic data suggests that similar approaches can be applied to denoising tasks. By improving the quality of seismic signals, deep learning models can enable more accurate damage detection and assessment, which is critical for post-earthquake response and recovery efforts.

In conclusion, deep learning techniques, including CNNs and autoencoders, have shown great promise in seismic signal denoising. These methods can effectively remove noise from seismic data, improve signal quality, and enable more accurate analysis. The availability of large-scale datasets and the adaptability of deep learning models to varying noise conditions make them a powerful tool for seismic data processing. Future research should focus on developing more robust and efficient denoising models that can handle complex and diverse seismic data, as well as exploring the integration of deep learning with physics-based models to enhance the accuracy and reliability of seismic analysis.

### 3.2 Pattern Recognition in Seismic Data

Pattern recognition in seismic data is a crucial task in earthquake engineering, as it enables the identification of meaningful features and the classification of seismic events. Machine learning algorithms, particularly supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, have emerged as powerful tools for this purpose. These algorithms help in the accurate identification and classification of seismic events by extracting patterns from seismic data. The use of machine learning in pattern recognition has been extensively explored in several studies, showcasing its potential to revolutionize the field of seismology and earthquake engineering.

One of the key applications of machine learning in pattern recognition for seismic data is the classification of seismic events. Supervised learning algorithms, such as decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks, have been widely used for this purpose. These algorithms require labeled data to train the model, where each data point is associated with a specific class or label. For instance, the study by [4] demonstrated the effectiveness of decision tree algorithms in predicting the seismic failure modes of reinforced concrete shear walls. The results showed that the decision tree method provided a high classification accuracy with better interpretability compared to other machine learning methods. This highlights the potential of supervised learning in classifying seismic events based on their characteristics.

Another approach to pattern recognition in seismic data is the use of unsupervised learning techniques. These methods do not require labeled data and instead rely on the inherent structure of the data to identify patterns. Clustering algorithms, such as K-means and hierarchical clustering, have been employed to group similar seismic events based on their features. For example, the study by [94] utilized unsupervised learning to classify buildings based on their seismic damage potential. The study showed that unsupervised learning techniques could effectively identify patterns in seismic data, enabling the classification of buildings into different damage categories. This approach is particularly useful when labeled data is scarce or unavailable, which is often the case in seismic data analysis.

In addition to supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning techniques have also been applied to pattern recognition in seismic data. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have shown remarkable performance in identifying complex patterns in seismic signals. These models can automatically learn hierarchical representations of the data, which makes them highly effective for tasks such as feature extraction and event classification. The study by [10] demonstrated the use of deep learning techniques to model the dynamic behavior of faults, highlighting the potential of deep learning in capturing the intricate patterns present in seismic data. The results showed that deep learning models could accurately predict the behavior of faults under different conditions, which is crucial for earthquake prediction and risk assessment.

Feature extraction is another important aspect of pattern recognition in seismic data. Machine learning algorithms can be used to identify and extract meaningful features from seismic signals, which can then be used for classification and prediction tasks. For instance, the study by [12] focused on the energy dissipation capacity of reinforced concrete shear walls. The study utilized machine learning techniques to identify the key design parameters that influence the energy dissipation capacity of shear walls. The results showed that machine learning models could effectively extract relevant features from the data, providing insights into the seismic performance of structural elements. This demonstrates the potential of machine learning in feature extraction, which is essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms of seismic events.

Moreover, the integration of domain knowledge with machine learning techniques has been shown to enhance the performance of pattern recognition in seismic data. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been developed to incorporate physical laws and constraints into the learning process, ensuring that the models adhere to the underlying physical principles. The study by [7] explored the use of physics-informed machine learning to predict the seismic response of nonlinear structures. The results showed that the integration of physical constraints into the machine learning model improved the accuracy and reliability of the predictions. This highlights the importance of combining domain knowledge with machine learning techniques to enhance the performance of pattern recognition in seismic data.

Another important aspect of pattern recognition in seismic data is the use of hybrid models that combine the strengths of different machine learning techniques. These models can leverage the capabilities of multiple algorithms to achieve better performance. For example, the study by [79] proposed a physics-guided convolutional neural network (PhyCNN) framework for data-driven seismic response modeling. The PhyCNN model incorporated physical constraints into the neural network architecture, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness. This study demonstrated the potential of hybrid models in pattern recognition, as they can effectively combine the strengths of different machine learning techniques.

Furthermore, the use of transfer learning has been explored to improve the performance of pattern recognition in seismic data. Transfer learning involves pre-training a model on a large dataset and then fine-tuning it on a smaller dataset specific to the task at hand. This approach can be particularly useful when the amount of labeled seismic data is limited. The study by [95] highlighted the potential of transfer learning in overcoming data scarcity and improving model generalization across different seismic regions. The results showed that transfer learning techniques could effectively adapt pre-trained models to new seismic datasets, leading to improved performance in pattern recognition tasks.

In conclusion, machine learning algorithms play a crucial role in pattern recognition for seismic data. Supervised learning techniques, such as decision trees and neural networks, have been successfully applied to classify seismic events. Unsupervised learning methods, including clustering algorithms, have been used to identify patterns in unlabeled data. Deep learning models, such as CNNs and RNNs, have shown remarkable performance in capturing complex patterns in seismic signals. Additionally, the integration of domain knowledge and the use of hybrid models have been shown to enhance the accuracy and reliability of pattern recognition in seismic data. These approaches collectively contribute to the advancement of machine learning in earthquake engineering, enabling more accurate and efficient seismic data analysis and interpretation.

### 3.3 Detection of Seismic Events using Deep Learning

The detection of seismic events is a critical task in earthquake engineering, as it underpins the ability to monitor, predict, and respond to seismic activities effectively. Traditional methods for seismic event detection have relied on manually crafted algorithms and threshold-based techniques, which are often limited by their inability to handle the complexity and variability of seismic signals. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to address these challenges, offering enhanced accuracy and robustness in detecting seismic events, particularly in real-time monitoring systems [15; 96; 97; 15].

Deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), have been widely adopted for seismic event detection due to their ability to automatically learn complex patterns from raw seismic data. CNNs are particularly well-suited for this task as they can capture spatial hierarchies in seismic waveforms, making them effective for tasks such as identifying P- and S-wave arrivals [96; 15]. For instance, the Seismogram Transformer (SeisT) model, which combines multiple modules tailored to different tasks, demonstrates impressive out-of-distribution generalization performance, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art models in tasks like earthquake detection and phase picking [15]. The use of CNNs in SeisT enables the model to capture the spatial dependencies in seismic data, which is crucial for accurate event detection.

In addition to CNNs, RNNs and their variants, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have also been extensively used in seismic event detection. RNNs are well-suited for processing time-series data, making them ideal for analyzing the temporal dynamics of seismic signals. The CRED (Cnn-Rnn Earthquake Detector) model, for example, employs a combination of convolutional layers and bidirectional LSTM units in a residual structure to detect earthquake signals [96]. This approach allows the model to learn the time-frequency characteristics of dominant phases in an earthquake signal from three-component data recorded on a single station. The model achieved an impressive F-score of 99.95, demonstrating its robustness to background noise and non-earthquake signals.

One of the key advantages of deep learning models in seismic event detection is their ability to reduce false positives, a critical concern in real-time monitoring systems. Traditional methods often suffer from high false alarm rates due to their reliance on fixed thresholds and limited adaptability to varying signal conditions. Deep learning models, on the other hand, can learn from large volumes of data and adapt to different scenarios, significantly improving the accuracy of event detection. The Seismic-Net model, for instance, leverages a deep densely connected neural network to detect seismic events by classifying fixed-length windows of time-series data [97]. The model achieved a precision/recall of 0.889/0.923, highlighting its effectiveness in distinguishing genuine seismic events from noise.

Another significant contribution of deep learning in seismic event detection is the integration of advanced architectures that enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns in seismic data. For example, the use of attention mechanisms in deep learning models has shown promising results in improving the accuracy of event detection [76]. Attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on the most relevant features of the seismic signal, leading to better performance in detecting seismic events. The proposed model combines CNNs, BiLSTMs, and attention mechanisms to effectively capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in the data, resulting in more accurate predictions of earthquake occurrences.

Deep learning models have also been applied to the detection of weak seismic signals, which are often challenging to identify using traditional methods. The Earthquake Detective project, for example, leverages citizen science and machine learning to detect and classify weak signals in seismograms from potentially dynamically triggered (PDT) events [98]. The study demonstrates that with an image- and wavelet-based algorithm, machine learning can detect signals from small earthquakes and even PDT tremor, which has not been previously demonstrated. This highlights the potential of deep learning in detecting weak signals that may be missed by traditional methods.

Moreover, the use of deep learning in seismic event detection has led to the development of real-time monitoring systems that can quickly respond to seismic activities. The Generalized Neural Networks for Real-Time Earthquake Early Warning model, for instance, employs a data recombination method to create generalized earthquakes for training neural networks, enabling the models to be applied to various regions with different monitoring setups [22]. This approach allows for real-time Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) to be initiated at the very early stages of an occurring earthquake, significantly improving the response time for emergency services.

In summary, the use of deep learning models such as CNNs and RNNs has revolutionized the field of seismic event detection, offering enhanced accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. These models have demonstrated their ability to reduce false positives, detect weak signals, and support real-time monitoring systems. As the field of earthquake engineering continues to evolve, the integration of deep learning into seismic event detection will play a crucial role in improving our ability to monitor and respond to seismic activities effectively. The advancements in deep learning have not only improved the performance of existing detection methods but also opened up new possibilities for the future of seismic monitoring and early warning systems [96; 97; 15].

### 3.4 Handling Missing Data and Interpolation

Handling missing data and interpolation is a critical aspect of seismic data analysis and processing, as seismic datasets often suffer from incomplete or irregular data acquisition. Missing data can arise due to various reasons, such as sensor malfunctions, environmental constraints, or limitations in data collection infrastructure. These gaps in the data can significantly impact the quality and reliability of seismic analyses, making it essential to address them using advanced machine learning techniques. Machine learning plays a pivotal role in interpolating missing seismic data, enabling the enhancement of dataset quality and improving the accuracy of subsequent seismic interpretations.

One of the primary challenges in seismic data processing is the irregularity of data acquisition. Seismic data is typically collected using a network of sensors, and the spatial and temporal distribution of these sensors can lead to uneven data coverage. For instance, in regions with limited sensor deployment, the data may be sparse, while in areas with dense sensor networks, the data may be highly redundant. This uneven distribution can result in missing data points that need to be interpolated to ensure a consistent and accurate representation of the seismic signal. Machine learning models, particularly those based on deep learning, have shown great promise in addressing these challenges by learning the underlying patterns in the available data and using them to predict missing values.

Several studies have explored the use of machine learning techniques for handling missing seismic data. For instance, the paper titled "SeisFusion: Constrained Diffusion Model with Input Guidance for 3D Seismic Data Interpolation and Reconstruction" [99] presents a novel diffusion model framework for 3D seismic data interpolation. This approach introduces conditional supervision constraints to the diffusion model, allowing it to generate data based on the input data to be reconstructed. By incorporating missing data into the generation process, the model produces reconstructions with higher consistency. This method effectively addresses complex missing patterns in seismic data, demonstrating the potential of diffusion models in handling missing data.

Another approach to interpolating missing seismic data involves the use of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs have been widely used in various domains for data generation and augmentation. In the context of seismic data, GANs can be trained on existing data to generate synthetic samples that fill in the gaps caused by missing data. The paper titled "SeismoGen: Seismic Waveform Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks" [28] explores the application of GANs for generating synthetic seismic waveforms. The study demonstrates that GANs can produce high-quality synthetic samples that closely resemble real seismic data, making them a viable option for interpolating missing data.

In addition to GANs, other deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), have also been employed for handling missing seismic data. CNNs are particularly effective in capturing spatial dependencies in seismic data, making them suitable for interpolating missing values in spatially distributed datasets. The paper titled "CRED: A Deep Residual Network of Convolutional and Recurrent Units for Earthquake Signal Detection" [34] presents a deep residual network that combines convolutional layers and bidirectional long short-term memory units for earthquake signal detection. This model effectively learns the time-frequency characteristics of seismic signals, which can be used to interpolate missing data points.

Interpolation techniques for missing seismic data also benefit from the integration of physics-based models. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been used to incorporate physical constraints into the interpolation process, ensuring that the generated data adheres to the underlying physical laws. The paper titled "Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction" [10] discusses the use of PINNs for interpolating missing data in the context of fault friction modeling. By embedding physical equations into the neural network architecture, these models can generate more reliable and physically consistent interpolations.

Moreover, the use of transfer learning has shown promise in addressing missing data challenges in seismic data processing. Transfer learning allows models trained on one dataset to be adapted to another, leveraging the knowledge gained from the source dataset to improve performance on the target dataset. The paper titled "Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation" [95] highlights the effectiveness of transfer learning in overcoming data scarcity and improving model generalization across different seismic regions and datasets. This approach is particularly useful when the target dataset has limited labeled data, as it can utilize the knowledge from the source dataset to fill in the gaps.

Another important aspect of handling missing data in seismic datasets is the use of ensemble methods. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions. These methods can be particularly effective in interpolating missing data by leveraging the strengths of different models. The paper titled "Ensemble Learning for Seismic Data Analysis" [100] discusses the application of ensemble methods in seismic data processing, demonstrating their ability to handle missing data and improve the overall quality of seismic datasets.

In summary, handling missing data and interpolation in seismic datasets is a critical task that requires the application of advanced machine learning techniques. The use of deep learning models, generative adversarial networks, physics-informed neural networks, transfer learning, and ensemble methods has shown great promise in addressing these challenges. These techniques not only help in interpolating missing data but also enhance the overall quality and reliability of seismic datasets, enabling more accurate and robust seismic analyses. The integration of these methods into seismic data processing pipelines is essential for improving the accuracy and efficiency of seismic data analysis and processing.

### 3.5 Noise Suppression Techniques in Seismic Data

Noise suppression is a critical aspect of seismic data analysis, as seismic signals are often contaminated by random and coherent noise that can obscure meaningful patterns and reduce the accuracy of subsequent processing tasks. Machine learning techniques have emerged as powerful tools for noise suppression, enabling the extraction of clean signals from noisy seismic recordings. This subsection explores various noise suppression techniques, including self-supervised learning and physics-informed neural networks, that are used to mitigate the impact of noise in seismic data.

One of the most widely studied approaches for noise suppression in seismic data is the use of self-supervised learning. Self-supervised learning is particularly useful in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain, as it leverages the structure of the data itself to learn meaningful representations without the need for explicit annotations. In seismic data analysis, self-supervised learning has been applied to denoise seismic signals by learning to reconstruct the original signal from noisy inputs. For example, the paper titled "Deep Autoassociative Neural Networks for Noise Reduction in Seismic data" [29] explores the use of autoassociative neural networks, a type of self-supervised learning model, to remove random noise from seismic data. The study demonstrates that autoassociative neural networks can effectively reduce noise while preserving the essential features of the seismic signal. However, the study also notes that the resolution of the output signal is compromised to some extent, highlighting the trade-off between noise suppression and signal fidelity. This limitation underscores the importance of optimizing the network architecture and training strategy to achieve a balance between noise reduction and signal preservation.

Another promising approach to noise suppression in seismic data is the integration of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). PINNs are a class of deep learning models that incorporate physical laws and domain knowledge into the training process, ensuring that the model's predictions are consistent with the underlying physics of the problem. In the context of seismic data processing, physics-informed neural networks can be used to suppress noise by enforcing constraints derived from the governing equations of wave propagation. For instance, the paper titled "Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction" [10] presents a physics-informed neural network that is trained to predict fault friction parameters while adhering to the physical laws governing the behavior of the Earth's crust. Although the primary focus of the study is on fault friction, the methodology can be adapted to suppress noise in seismic data by incorporating physical constraints into the model. Similarly, the paper titled "Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Seismic Response Prediction OF Nonlinear Steel Moment Resisting Frame Structures" [7] introduces a physics-informed machine learning framework that integrates the laws of motion into the model architecture. This approach not only improves the accuracy of the predictions but also enhances the robustness of the model in the presence of noise, making it a viable option for noise suppression in seismic data.

In addition to self-supervised learning and physics-informed neural networks, other machine learning techniques have been explored for noise suppression in seismic data. One such technique is the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate synthetic seismic data that can be used to train noise suppression models. GANs are particularly effective in scenarios where the amount of clean seismic data is limited, as they can generate high-quality synthetic data that mimics the characteristics of real seismic signals. The paper titled "SeismoGen  Seismic Waveform Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks" [28] presents a GAN-based approach for generating synthetic seismic waveforms, which can be used to augment the training dataset and improve the performance of noise suppression models. The study shows that the use of synthetic data generated by GANs significantly enhances the detectability of seismic events, demonstrating the potential of GANs in noise suppression tasks.

Another technique that has gained attention in recent years is the use of transfer learning for noise suppression in seismic data. Transfer learning involves leveraging pre-trained models that have been trained on large datasets to improve the performance of models trained on smaller, domain-specific datasets. In the context of seismic data processing, transfer learning can be used to adapt models trained on clean seismic data to suppress noise in real-world seismic recordings. The paper titled "Generalized Neural Networks for Real-Time Earthquake Early Warning" [22] demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in improving the generalization performance of neural networks across different seismic regions. By training models on a diverse set of seismic data, the study shows that transfer learning can significantly reduce the impact of noise and improve the accuracy of earthquake detection and parameter estimation.

In summary, noise suppression techniques play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of seismic data and improving the accuracy of subsequent analysis tasks. Self-supervised learning, physics-informed neural networks, GANs, and transfer learning are among the most promising approaches for noise suppression in seismic data. Each of these techniques offers unique advantages, and their effectiveness can vary depending on the characteristics of the seismic data and the specific noise suppression task. Future research in this area should focus on developing hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of these techniques to achieve more robust and efficient noise suppression in seismic data.

### 3.6 Real-Time Processing and Efficient Algorithms

---
Real-time processing and the development of efficient algorithms are of paramount importance in seismic data analysis, especially as the volume and complexity of seismic data continue to grow. Traditional approaches to seismic hazard assessment and mitigation rely heavily on manual analysis of seismic data, which is not only time-consuming but also prone to human error. In contrast, machine learning (ML) algorithms offer the potential to automate the detection and classification of seismic events, enabling faster and more accurate responses to seismic hazards. However, the effectiveness of ML algorithms in seismic data analysis is contingent on their ability to process large volumes of data with minimal latency, a challenge that is often overlooked in the design of ML models.

Real-time seismic data analysis is a critical requirement for earthquake early warning systems, where timely detection and characterization of seismic events can significantly reduce the risk of loss of life and property damage. The emergence of large-scale seismic monitoring networks has led to an exponential increase in the amount of data generated, making it imperative to develop ML algorithms that can process this data in real-time. Real-time processing is not just about speed; it is also about maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the analysis, even under high data throughput conditions. For instance, the work by [101] highlights the importance of efficient noise suppression techniques in seismic data analysis. The study demonstrates that a multi-scale feature-fusion-based network can achieve an AP@0.5 of 78.67%, which is a significant improvement over traditional methods. However, the study also emphasizes the need for efficient algorithms that can handle the computational demands of real-time data processing.

Efficient algorithms are essential for real-time seismic data analysis, as they must process large volumes of data with minimal latency. Traditional ML algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests, are often not suitable for real-time applications due to their high computational complexity and slow inference times. In contrast, deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), offer the potential to process seismic data in real-time, provided that they are optimized for efficiency. For example, [86] presents a CNN classifier that achieves an F1-score of 93.56% on a dataset of 6,613 seismograms. The study highlights the importance of optimizing CNN architectures for real-time processing, as the model's performance on real-world data is highly dependent on its ability to handle large volumes of data efficiently.

The development of efficient algorithms for real-time seismic data analysis is further complicated by the need to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. While deep learning models have demonstrated superior performance in seismic data analysis, they often require significant computational resources, which can limit their applicability in real-time scenarios. To address this challenge, researchers have explored various optimization techniques, such as model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, to reduce the computational complexity of deep learning models while maintaining their performance. For instance, [102] proposes the use of autoencoder networks to learn a direct mapping between seismic data and a representative latent manifold. The study demonstrates that the trained decoder can be used as a nonlinear preconditioner for physics-driven inverse problems, which can significantly reduce the computational burden of seismic data processing.

Another key consideration in real-time seismic data analysis is the need for robust and reliable algorithms that can handle the variability and uncertainty inherent in seismic data. Seismic data is often noisy and contains a high degree of variability, which can make it challenging to develop ML models that generalize well across different seismic environments. To address this issue, researchers have explored the use of self-supervised learning techniques, which do not require labeled data for training. For example, [103] presents a self-supervised approach for seismic denoising that leverages the properties of blind-spot networks. The study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively suppress random noise while preserving the integrity of the seismic signal, even in the presence of complex noise patterns. However, the study also highlights the need for efficient algorithms that can handle the computational demands of self-supervised learning in real-time scenarios.

The importance of real-time processing and efficient algorithms in seismic data analysis is further underscored by the need for rapid decision-making in earthquake early warning systems. These systems rely on the ability to detect and characterize seismic events in real-time, which requires the development of ML algorithms that can process data with minimal latency. For instance, [104] presents a deep learning-based approach for earthquake early warning systems, where seismic data is converted into audio signals for analysis. The study demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve high accuracy in earthquake detection, with a testing accuracy of 91.1% for a 0.2-second sample window length. However, the study also emphasizes the need for efficient algorithms that can handle the computational demands of real-time data processing, as the proposed method requires significant computational resources to achieve its high performance.

In addition to the computational requirements of real-time seismic data analysis, there is also a need to ensure the scalability of ML algorithms. As seismic monitoring networks continue to expand, the volume of data generated by these networks will only increase, making it imperative to develop algorithms that can scale efficiently. For example, [105] presents a U-net model that is trained on synthetic seismic data to remove noise and deblend seismic data. The study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively handle large volumes of data, making it a promising approach for real-time seismic data analysis. However, the study also highlights the need for efficient algorithms that can scale to handle the increasing data volumes generated by modern seismic monitoring networks.

Overall, the importance of real-time processing and efficient algorithms in seismic data analysis cannot be overstated. As the volume and complexity of seismic data continue to grow, the development of ML algorithms that can process this data in real-time will be essential for the success of earthquake early warning systems and other seismic applications. The studies cited above highlight the challenges and opportunities associated with real-time seismic data analysis, and provide valuable insights into the design of efficient algorithms that can handle the computational demands of real-time data processing. By addressing these challenges, researchers can help to ensure that ML algorithms are not only effective in seismic data analysis but also practical for real-world applications.

### 3.7 Transfer Learning for Seismic Data

Transfer learning has emerged as a powerful technique in seismic data analysis, offering a way to overcome the challenges of data scarcity and the need for extensive labeled datasets. By leveraging pre-trained models on large datasets, transfer learning allows for the adaptation of these models to specific seismic tasks, thereby improving performance and reducing the reliance on domain-specific labeled data. This approach has been increasingly applied in various aspects of seismic data analysis, including earthquake detection, signal processing, and pattern recognition, as highlighted by several studies.

In the context of seismic data, transfer learning involves training a model on a large, general dataset and then fine-tuning it on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This technique is particularly beneficial in seismic applications, where labeled data can be limited due to the rarity of seismic events and the complexity of data acquisition. For instance, in the paper titled "Generalized Neural Networks for Real-Time Earthquake Early Warning," the authors propose a data recombination method to create generalized earthquakes for neural network training. The trained models can then be applied to various regions with different monitoring setups for earthquake detection and parameter evaluation from continuous seismic waveform streams. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in enhancing the generalizability of models across diverse seismic environments [22].

Another significant application of transfer learning in seismic data analysis is seen in the work presented in "CRED: A Deep Residual Network of Convolutional and Recurrent Units for Earthquake Signal Detection." The authors introduce a deep learning model that combines convolutional layers and bidirectional long-short-term memory units in a residual structure. The network is trained using 500,000 seismograms, and its robustness is validated through application to semi-synthetic signals. The model's ability to generalize across different seismic conditions highlights the potential of transfer learning in improving the detection of seismic events, even with limited labeled data [34].

The use of transfer learning is also evident in the paper titled "Seismic-phase detection using multiple deep learning models for global and local representations of waveforms." The authors propose a novel phase detection method that employs deep learning, emphasizing the importance of global and local representations of waveforms. By leveraging pre-trained models and adapting them to specific tasks, the authors demonstrate improved robustness and flexibility in phase detection, which is crucial for accurate earthquake monitoring [23].

In the context of seismic data analysis, transfer learning has also been applied to improve the accuracy of earthquake magnitude estimation. The paper "A Machine-Learning Approach for Earthquake Magnitude Estimation" presents a single-station deep-learning approach for estimating earthquake magnitude directly from raw waveforms. The model is trained without instrument response correction, showcasing the potential of transfer learning in adapting models to different seismic conditions and improving the reliability of magnitude predictions [106].

Furthermore, the paper "A Deep Neural Network to identify foreshocks in real time" explores the use of deep learning for identifying foreshocks in real-time. The authors propose an algorithm based on deep learning that can classify seismic waveforms as foreshocks, mainshocks, or aftershocks with high accuracy. This study underscores the importance of transfer learning in adapting models to real-time seismic monitoring tasks, where the ability to generalize across different seismic scenarios is critical [72].

In addition to these applications, transfer learning has been used to enhance the performance of models in seismic inversion tasks. The paper "Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction" highlights the integration of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with deep learning techniques. The authors demonstrate how transfer learning can be used to improve the accuracy of models in predicting fault friction parameters, which is essential for assessing seismic hazards [10].

The paper "Seismic Facies Analysis: A Deep Domain Adaptation Approach" also illustrates the use of transfer learning in seismic data analysis. The authors propose a deep neural network architecture named EarthAdaptNet (EAN) for semantically segmenting seismic images when labeled data is scarce. By leveraging transfer learning, the model achieves improved performance in classifying seismic facies, demonstrating the potential of this approach in overcoming data scarcity in seismic applications [83].

Moreover, the paper "Deep Learning for Spatio-Temporal Data Mining: A Survey" provides a comprehensive overview of the application of deep learning techniques in spatio-temporal data mining. The authors discuss the use of transfer learning in adapting models to different spatio-temporal tasks, emphasizing the importance of leveraging pre-trained models to improve performance in seismic data analysis [107].

In conclusion, transfer learning has proven to be a valuable tool in seismic data analysis, offering a way to overcome the challenges of data scarcity and the need for extensive labeled datasets. By leveraging pre-trained models and adapting them to specific seismic tasks, transfer learning enhances the performance of models and reduces the reliance on domain-specific data. The studies cited above demonstrate the effectiveness of transfer learning in various aspects of seismic data analysis, including earthquake detection, signal processing, and pattern recognition, highlighting its potential for future research and applications in the field.

### 3.8 Unsupervised and Self-Supervised Learning Approaches

Unsupervised and self-supervised learning approaches have emerged as powerful tools in seismic data processing, addressing the challenge of learning meaningful representations without the need for labeled data. In the context of earthquake engineering, where labeled data is scarce, these techniques provide a viable alternative for extracting useful features and patterns from complex seismic signals. Unlike supervised learning, which requires extensive labeled datasets, unsupervised learning algorithms can work with raw data, identifying hidden structures and relationships within the data. Self-supervised learning, a more recent development, leverages the data itself to create pseudo-labels, allowing models to learn from the data without external supervision. These approaches are particularly valuable in earthquake engineering, where the complexity and variability of seismic data make traditional labeling impractical.

One of the key advantages of unsupervised learning in seismic data processing is its ability to identify anomalies and patterns that may not be immediately apparent to human analysts. For example, clustering algorithms such as k-means and hierarchical clustering have been employed to group similar seismic events, aiding in the detection of unusual or potentially damaging seismic activity [37]. These methods can help in identifying regions of high seismic activity or detecting subtle changes in seismic patterns that might indicate structural damage. In addition, autoencoders, a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning, have been applied to seismic data to learn efficient representations of the data, enabling better anomaly detection and noise reduction [38].

Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, offers an even more flexible approach by allowing models to learn from the data itself. This technique involves creating tasks that can be solved using the data, such as predicting the next sample in a sequence or reconstructing corrupted data. For example, in the context of seismic data, self-supervised learning can be used to train models to predict the next seismic signal based on previous data, effectively learning the underlying patterns and structures of the seismic signals [42]. This approach not only reduces the need for labeled data but also enhances the model's ability to generalize to new and unseen seismic events.

The application of unsupervised and self-supervised learning in seismic data processing has been demonstrated in several studies. For instance, the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) has been explored for the purpose of detecting and localizing structural damage in buildings and bridges [42]. These models can learn the normal behavior of a structure and identify deviations that may indicate damage, even in the absence of labeled data. Similarly, self-supervised learning has been used to train models to detect and classify seismic events without relying on pre-labeled datasets [108]. This is particularly important in earthquake engineering, where the availability of labeled data is often limited.

Another significant application of unsupervised learning in seismic data processing is the use of generative models to synthesize realistic seismic data. Generative adversarial networks (GANs), for example, can be trained to generate synthetic seismic signals that closely resemble real data. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the available seismic data is limited or incomplete, as the synthetic data can be used to augment the training dataset and improve the performance of machine learning models [109]. Self-supervised learning techniques can also be used to generate pseudo-labels for the synthetic data, further enhancing the model's ability to learn from the data.

In addition to these applications, unsupervised and self-supervised learning approaches have been used to improve the interpretability and explainability of machine learning models in earthquake engineering. For instance, the use of self-supervised learning to pre-train models on large datasets of seismic data has been shown to improve the model's ability to generalize to new tasks and reduce the need for extensive fine-tuning [110]. This is particularly important in earthquake engineering, where the ability to interpret and understand the model's predictions is crucial for decision-making and risk assessment.

The effectiveness of unsupervised and self-supervised learning in seismic data processing has also been validated through various case studies and experiments. For example, a study on the use of self-supervised learning for damage detection in bridges demonstrated that the model could achieve high accuracy in detecting and localizing damage without the need for labeled data [111]. Similarly, another study on the application of unsupervised learning for seismic data denoising showed that the model could effectively remove noise from seismic signals while preserving important features [112]. These studies highlight the potential of these techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of seismic data analysis.

In conclusion, unsupervised and self-supervised learning approaches have proven to be highly effective in seismic data processing, offering a viable alternative to traditional supervised learning methods. These techniques enable the extraction of meaningful representations from complex seismic data, facilitating the detection of anomalies, the identification of patterns, and the improvement of model interpretability. As the field of earthquake engineering continues to evolve, the integration of unsupervised and self-supervised learning will play a crucial role in advancing the accuracy and reliability of seismic data analysis. By leveraging the power of these techniques, researchers and practitioners can develop more robust and efficient models for earthquake prediction, monitoring, and risk assessment.

### 3.9 Evaluation and Performance Metrics for Seismic Data Analysis

Evaluation and performance metrics are essential components in assessing the effectiveness of machine learning models in seismic data analysis. These metrics provide a quantitative measure of how well a model performs in tasks such as signal denoising, pattern recognition, event detection, and data interpolation. The selection of appropriate evaluation criteria ensures that the models can be effectively validated and compared, allowing researchers to identify the most suitable techniques for their specific applications.

One of the most commonly used metrics in seismic data analysis is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which quantifies the quality of a signal in the presence of noise. SNR is calculated as the ratio of the power of the signal to the power of the background noise. A higher SNR indicates a cleaner, more reliable signal. In the context of seismic data, SNR is crucial for assessing the performance of denoising algorithms, as it reflects the model's ability to preserve meaningful seismic features while suppressing unwanted noise. The paper titled "Robustness of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to Noise in Sensor Data" [113] emphasizes the importance of SNR in evaluating the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in improving the quality of seismic signals, demonstrating that models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and autoencoders can significantly enhance SNR compared to traditional methods.

Another key metric is accuracy, which measures the proportion of correct predictions made by a model. In seismic data analysis, accuracy is often used to evaluate classification tasks, such as the detection of seismic events. The paper "Physics-Informed Neural Networks to Model and Control Robots" [114] highlights the use of accuracy as a primary evaluation metric, showing that deep learning models like CNNs and RNNs can achieve high accuracy in detecting seismic events even in noisy environments. However, the paper also cautions that accuracy alone may not be sufficient, especially in imbalanced datasets where the majority class dominates, potentially leading to misleading conclusions about model performance.

In addition to accuracy, other metrics such as precision, recall, and the F1 score are often used to evaluate classification models in seismic data analysis. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of a model's performance. These metrics are particularly useful in tasks such as earthquake detection, where false positives and false negatives can have significant consequences. The paper "Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Discovering Systems with Unmeasurable States with Application to Lithium-Ion Batteries" [49] discusses the importance of these metrics in assessing the reliability of deep learning models for earthquake detection, emphasizing that a model with high precision and recall is crucial for minimizing both false alarms and missed detections.

Computational efficiency is another critical factor in evaluating machine learning models for seismic data analysis, especially in real-time applications. Computational efficiency refers to the speed and resource requirements of a model during training and inference. In seismic data processing, where large volumes of data must be analyzed quickly, computational efficiency is essential to ensure timely and accurate results. The paper "Scalable algorithms for physics-informed neural and graph networks" [115] highlights the importance of developing efficient machine learning algorithms for seismic data analysis, discussing techniques such as model compression, pruning, and quantization to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance. The authors argue that real-time processing capabilities are vital for applications such as early warning systems, where rapid decision-making can save lives and reduce damage.

In addition to these metrics, researchers often use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on a subset, and testing it on another. This process is repeated multiple times to ensure that the model performs consistently across different data splits. The paper "Label Propagation Training Schemes for Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes" [116] discusses the use of cross-validation in evaluating the performance of transfer learning models in seismic data analysis, demonstrating that cross-validation helps identify models that generalize well to unseen data.

The evaluation of machine learning models in seismic data analysis also involves the use of confusion matrices, which provide a detailed breakdown of the model's performance across different classes. Confusion matrices are particularly useful for identifying patterns of misclassification, which can help researchers improve model performance. The paper "Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Hard Linear Equality Constraints" [47] discusses the use of confusion matrices in evaluating the performance of unsupervised learning models, showing that they can provide valuable insights into the model's ability to distinguish between different seismic patterns.

Another important aspect of evaluation is the use of domain-specific metrics tailored to the unique challenges of seismic data. For example, in seismic phase detection, the accuracy of phase picking (the identification of different seismic phases such as P-waves and S-waves) is critical for accurate earthquake location and magnitude estimation. The paper "Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Discovering Systems with Unmeasurable States with Application to Lithium-Ion Batteries" [49] emphasizes the importance of phase picking accuracy as a key performance metric, discussing how deep learning models can improve the accuracy of phase detection compared to traditional methods.

In conclusion, the evaluation and performance metrics for seismic data analysis encompass a wide range of criteria, including signal-to-noise ratio, accuracy, computational efficiency, and domain-specific measures. These metrics are essential for assessing the effectiveness of machine learning models and ensuring their reliability in real-world applications. The papers cited above highlight the importance of these metrics and provide valuable insights into their application in seismic data analysis. By carefully selecting and applying these evaluation criteria, researchers can develop and refine machine learning models that are both accurate and efficient, ultimately enhancing our ability to analyze and interpret seismic data.

### 3.10 Challenges and Future Directions in Seismic Data Analysis

Seismic data analysis is a critical component in earthquake engineering, enabling researchers and practitioners to monitor, predict, and mitigate the impacts of seismic events. However, the application of machine learning (ML) in this domain faces several significant challenges, including data scarcity, model generalization, computational constraints, and the need for interpretable and robust models. Addressing these challenges is essential to improve the effectiveness and reliability of ML techniques in seismic data analysis.

One of the most pressing issues in seismic data analysis is data scarcity. Seismic data is often limited in quantity, quality, and diversity, which makes it challenging to train robust and generalizable ML models. The scarcity of labeled data, in particular, poses a major obstacle, as supervised learning techniques typically require large amounts of annotated data to achieve high performance. In the context of seismic data, labeled datasets are often expensive and time-consuming to create, as they require expert annotation to identify seismic events, faults, and other relevant features. This limitation is compounded by the fact that seismic data is inherently noisy and complex, with signals often buried in background noise and other interferences. As a result, many ML models struggle to generalize well to new or unseen data, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, researchers have explored techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning. For instance, GANs have been used to generate synthetic seismic data that can be used to augment existing datasets, improving the robustness of ML models [90]. Similarly, transfer learning approaches have been proposed to leverage pre-trained models on related tasks, reducing the need for large amounts of labeled seismic data [10].

Another significant challenge in applying ML to seismic data analysis is model generalization. Seismic data is highly variable, with different regions exhibiting unique characteristics due to variations in geology, tectonic activity, and environmental conditions. This variability makes it difficult for ML models to generalize across different seismic regions and datasets. For example, a model trained on data from one region may perform poorly when applied to data from another region due to differences in the underlying seismic processes and signal characteristics. This issue is particularly relevant in the context of real-time seismic monitoring and early warning systems, where models must be able to accurately detect and predict earthquakes across a wide range of environments. To improve model generalization, researchers have explored the use of domain adaptation techniques, which aim to adapt models trained on one domain to perform well on another. For instance, methods such as domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) have been proposed to reduce the domain-specific biases in ML models, enabling them to generalize better across different seismic datasets [117].

Computational constraints represent another major challenge in seismic data analysis. Seismic data is typically large in volume and high-dimensional, requiring significant computational resources to process and analyze. This is particularly true for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and require extensive training times. In the context of real-time seismic monitoring and early warning systems, computational efficiency is critical, as delays can have serious consequences for public safety and disaster response. To address this challenge, researchers have explored techniques such as model compression, quantization, and edge computing. For example, lightweight neural network architectures such as MobileNet and EfficientNet have been proposed to reduce the computational footprint of ML models while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, edge computing approaches have been developed to enable real-time seismic data processing at the data source, reducing the need for extensive data transmission and computation in centralized cloud environments [118].

Interpretability and explainability are also important considerations in seismic data analysis. Many ML models, particularly deep learning models, are often viewed as "black boxes," making it difficult to understand how they arrive at their predictions. This lack of transparency can be a significant barrier to their adoption in critical applications such as seismic hazard assessment and early warning systems, where trust and reliability are paramount. To address this issue, researchers have explored techniques such as feature importance analysis, attention mechanisms, and model-agnostic explanations. For example, SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) has been used to interpret the predictions of machine learning models for seismic data, helping to identify the most important features that contribute to the model's decision-making process [17]. Additionally, attention mechanisms have been integrated into deep learning models to highlight the most relevant parts of the seismic data, improving the interpretability of model predictions [119].

Looking ahead, several future research directions hold promise for advancing seismic data analysis using machine learning. One important area of research is the development of physics-informed ML models, which integrate domain-specific knowledge and physical laws into the model training process. By incorporating physical constraints and governing equations, these models can improve the accuracy and reliability of seismic predictions while ensuring that the model outputs are physically consistent [10]. Another promising direction is the integration of multimodal data, such as satellite imagery, social media, and sensor data, to enhance the richness and diversity of the input features used in ML models. For example, recent studies have demonstrated the potential of combining satellite imagery with seismic data to improve the detection and characterization of seismic events [120].

In addition to these technical challenges, there are also important ethical and societal considerations that must be addressed in the application of machine learning to seismic data analysis. For instance, the use of social media data for disaster response and monitoring raises concerns about data privacy, bias, and the potential for misinformation. To address these issues, researchers have proposed frameworks for ethical AI, which emphasize transparency, fairness, and accountability in the development and deployment of ML models [121]. Furthermore, there is a growing need for interdisciplinary collaboration between seismologists, computer scientists, and social scientists to ensure that ML models are not only technically sound but also socially responsible and equitable.

In conclusion, while machine learning has the potential to revolutionize seismic data analysis, several challenges must be addressed to fully realize its benefits. By tackling issues such as data scarcity, model generalization, computational constraints, and interpretability, researchers can develop more robust, reliable, and effective ML models for seismic data analysis. Future research should also focus on integrating domain-specific knowledge, leveraging multimodal data, and addressing ethical and societal concerns to ensure that ML techniques are used in a responsible and impactful manner.

## 4 Deep Learning for Earthquake Detection and Prediction

### 4.1 Deep Learning Models for Earthquake Detection

Deep learning models have emerged as a powerful tool for earthquake detection, offering significant improvements in accuracy, speed, and adaptability compared to traditional methods. Among the most widely used deep learning architectures for this task are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These models leverage their unique capabilities to process and interpret seismic data, which is often complex, high-dimensional, and noisy. By analyzing seismic waveforms, identifying patterns, and detecting anomalies, deep learning models contribute to the development of more reliable and efficient earthquake detection systems.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly well-suited for analyzing seismic data due to their ability to automatically extract spatial and temporal features from raw data. In the context of earthquake detection, CNNs can be trained to identify seismic events by learning from labeled datasets of seismic waveforms. For instance, the study by [76] demonstrated that CNNs, when combined with other architectures like BiLSTM, can effectively capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in seismic data, leading to more accurate predictions. Similarly, [6] showed that CNNs can be used to classify damage levels in buildings, a task that indirectly aids in earthquake detection by providing insights into the impact of seismic events.

RNNs, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are designed to process sequential data, making them ideal for analyzing time-series seismic signals. Earthquakes produce complex temporal patterns in seismic data, and RNNs can capture these patterns by learning from the historical behavior of seismic waves. In the study by [20], RNNs were used to predict the timing and magnitude of labquakes by analyzing sequences of acoustic emissions. The results demonstrated that RNNs, when combined with attention mechanisms, can effectively model the nonlinear dynamics of seismic events, leading to improved detection and forecasting capabilities. Furthermore, [5] highlighted the use of RNNs in real-time earthquake early warning systems, where the ability to process continuous seismic data streams is critical for timely alerts.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have also found applications in earthquake detection, particularly in generating synthetic seismic data for training and validation. GANs consist of two neural networks—a generator and a discriminator—that compete with each other to produce realistic data. In the context of earthquake detection, GANs can be used to generate synthetic seismic waveforms that mimic real-world seismic events, thereby addressing the challenge of limited and imbalanced training data. For example, [90] explored the use of GANs to augment seismic datasets, enhancing the robustness and generalizability of deep learning models. Additionally, [7] demonstrated that GANs can be used to generate synthetic data for training physics-informed neural networks, improving their performance in predicting structural responses under seismic loads.

One of the key advantages of deep learning models in earthquake detection is their ability to process high-dimensional data without the need for extensive manual feature engineering. Traditional methods often rely on hand-crafted features, which can be time-consuming and may not capture the full complexity of seismic data. In contrast, deep learning models automatically learn hierarchical representations of the data, allowing them to extract meaningful patterns that are difficult for humans to identify. This is particularly important in earthquake detection, where subtle changes in seismic waveforms can indicate the onset of an earthquake. For instance, [93] used deep learning to predict dynamic stress distributions in structural components, demonstrating the model's ability to capture complex relationships between input parameters and output responses.

Another significant benefit of deep learning models is their scalability and adaptability to different seismic environments. Earthquakes can occur in various regions with distinct geological and tectonic characteristics, and deep learning models can be trained on diverse datasets to improve their generalization capabilities. For example, [22] proposed a data recombination method to create generalized earthquakes that can be used to train models for different regions. The study demonstrated that the trained models could reliably detect earthquakes in diverse monitoring setups, highlighting the potential of deep learning for global earthquake early warning systems.

Despite the many advantages of deep learning in earthquake detection, several challenges remain. One of the primary challenges is the scarcity of labeled seismic data, which is essential for training supervised deep learning models. To address this issue, researchers have explored semi-supervised and self-supervised learning techniques, which can leverage unlabeled data to improve model performance. For example, [122] discussed the use of self-supervised learning for seismic data analysis, where models are trained to predict missing or corrupted data, enhancing their ability to generalize to unseen seismic events.

In summary, deep learning models such as CNNs, RNNs, and GANs have revolutionized earthquake detection by offering new ways to process, analyze, and interpret seismic data. Their ability to capture complex patterns, handle high-dimensional data, and generalize to different environments makes them indispensable tools in the field of earthquake engineering. While challenges such as data scarcity and model interpretability remain, ongoing research continues to push the boundaries of what is possible with deep learning, paving the way for more accurate and reliable earthquake detection systems.

### 4.2 Real-Time Earthquake Detection and Early Warning Systems

Real-time earthquake detection and early warning systems are critical components of modern seismic monitoring infrastructure, aiming to provide timely alerts and mitigate the impact of earthquakes. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in this domain, offering significant improvements in speed, accuracy, and adaptability over traditional methods. By leveraging the capabilities of deep neural networks, researchers have developed models that can process seismic data in real-time, detect earthquakes promptly, and generate early warnings with high reliability. These systems not only enhance the response time for emergency services but also provide critical information to the public, enabling them to take protective measures.

One of the key advantages of deep learning in real-time earthquake detection is its ability to process vast amounts of seismic data efficiently. Traditional methods often rely on manual analysis or rule-based algorithms, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are trained on large datasets of seismic signals, allowing them to automatically identify patterns and anomalies. These models can detect seismic events in real-time, significantly reducing the time required for earthquake detection and minimizing the risk of false alarms. The application of deep learning in this context has been demonstrated in various studies, with some models achieving near-instantaneous detection of seismic events [10].

Real-time earthquake detection systems are essential for early warning systems, which aim to provide critical seconds or minutes of warning before the arrival of strong shaking. Deep learning models can be integrated into these systems to process seismic data from a network of sensors, analyzing the data in real-time to identify the location, magnitude, and potential impact of an earthquake. This information is then used to generate early warnings, which can be disseminated to the public through various channels, such as mobile alerts, radio, and television. The integration of deep learning into early warning systems has been shown to improve the accuracy and timeliness of these warnings, ultimately saving lives and reducing damage to infrastructure.

A notable example of deep learning's application in real-time earthquake detection is the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for processing seismic data. CNNs are particularly well-suited for this task due to their ability to capture spatial and temporal patterns in data. By training CNNs on a large dataset of seismic signals, researchers have developed models that can detect seismic events with high accuracy. These models are capable of distinguishing between different types of seismic waves, such as P-waves and S-waves, which are crucial for determining the location and magnitude of an earthquake. The performance of these models has been validated through experiments using real-world seismic data, demonstrating their effectiveness in real-time applications [10].

Another important aspect of real-time earthquake detection is the ability to handle missing or incomplete data. Seismic data can often be noisy or incomplete due to sensor malfunctions, environmental factors, or transmission issues. Deep learning models, particularly those based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, are well-suited for handling such challenges. These models can learn from the temporal dependencies in seismic data, allowing them to fill in gaps and make accurate predictions even when some data points are missing. This capability is particularly valuable in real-time applications, where the availability of complete and accurate data is often a challenge.

In addition to improving detection accuracy, deep learning models can also enhance the reliability of early warning systems by incorporating uncertainty quantification techniques. Traditional methods often struggle to provide reliable estimates of the uncertainty associated with seismic predictions, which can lead to overconfidence in the results. Deep learning models, on the other hand, can be designed to provide probabilistic predictions, offering a more nuanced understanding of the likelihood of different outcomes. This information is crucial for emergency responders and decision-makers, who need to make informed decisions based on the available data. By integrating uncertainty quantification into deep learning models, researchers have developed more robust and reliable early warning systems that can better serve the needs of the public [10].

The development of real-time earthquake detection and early warning systems has also benefited from the use of physics-informed deep learning models. These models combine the strengths of deep learning with the principles of physics, ensuring that the predictions made by the models are consistent with the underlying physical laws. For example, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can be used to enforce constraints such as energy conservation and momentum balance, which are essential for accurately modeling seismic events. By incorporating these physical constraints, deep learning models can produce more reliable and interpretable results, making them more suitable for real-time applications [10].

The integration of deep learning into real-time earthquake detection and early warning systems has also led to the development of more efficient and scalable solutions. Traditional methods often require significant computational resources, making them less suitable for real-time applications. Deep learning models, particularly those designed for edge computing, can be optimized to run on low-power devices, enabling the deployment of real-time detection systems in remote or resource-constrained areas. This approach not only reduces the computational burden but also improves the responsiveness of early warning systems, allowing them to provide timely alerts even in challenging environments [10].

In summary, the application of deep learning in real-time earthquake detection and early warning systems has significantly advanced the field of seismic monitoring. By leveraging the power of deep neural networks, researchers have developed models that can detect earthquakes quickly and accurately, generate reliable early warnings, and handle the complexities of real-world seismic data. These systems have the potential to save lives, reduce damage to infrastructure, and improve the overall resilience of communities in earthquake-prone regions. As the field continues to evolve, further research and development will be necessary to enhance the performance and reliability of these systems, ensuring that they can effectively meet the challenges of future seismic events.

### 4.3 Use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Seismic Data Analysis

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as powerful tools in seismic data analysis, offering significant advantages in handling and interpreting seismic data. These networks excel at extracting spatial hierarchies from data, making them particularly well-suited for tasks such as signal denoising, pattern recognition, and the detection of seismic events. The use of CNNs in seismic data analysis has been extensively explored in recent research, with studies demonstrating their effectiveness in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of seismic monitoring and prediction systems.  

One of the primary applications of CNNs in seismic data analysis is signal denoising, where the goal is to extract meaningful seismic signals from noisy recordings. Traditional denoising techniques often rely on handcrafted features and domain-specific knowledge, which can be limiting in complex scenarios. CNNs, on the other hand, automatically learn hierarchical features from raw data, allowing them to effectively distinguish between true seismic signals and noise. For example, the study "Deep learning for laboratory earthquake prediction and autoregressive forecasting of fault zone stress" [20] highlights the use of CNNs in identifying seismic signals from acoustic emissions in controlled laboratory experiments. The authors note that CNNs are capable of capturing the intricate patterns present in seismic data, making them a valuable tool for noise reduction and signal enhancement.  

In addition to denoising, CNNs have been widely used for pattern recognition in seismic data. Seismic data typically consists of time-series recordings that can contain a wide range of patterns, including phase arrivals, fault slip, and other seismic phenomena. By leveraging the spatial and temporal capabilities of CNNs, researchers have developed models that can identify and classify these patterns with high accuracy. For instance, the paper "SeisT A foundational deep learning model for earthquake monitoring tasks" [15] presents a CNN-based model that achieves high performance in tasks such as phase picking and magnitude estimation. The study demonstrates that CNNs can effectively capture both local and global features of seismic signals, enabling the identification of subtle patterns that may be missed by traditional methods.  

Another critical application of CNNs in seismic data analysis is the detection of seismic events. Detecting seismic events from raw data is a challenging task due to the high levels of noise and the variability in signal characteristics. CNNs have shown remarkable performance in this area, with many studies reporting significant improvements in detection accuracy compared to conventional methods. For example, "A CNN-BiLSTM Model with Attention Mechanism for Earthquake Prediction" [76] introduces a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM model that leverages the strengths of both architectures to enhance seismic event detection. The study emphasizes that CNNs are particularly effective in capturing the spatial features of seismic signals, while BiLSTMs are well-suited for modeling temporal dependencies. The integration of these two components enables the model to detect seismic events with high precision, even in complex and noisy environments.  

Furthermore, CNNs have been applied to the detection of weak seismic signals, which are often challenging to identify using traditional methods. The study "Applying Machine Learning to Crowd-sourced Data from Earthquake Detective" [98] explores the use of CNNs in detecting weak seismic signals from crowd-sourced data. The authors demonstrate that CNNs can effectively identify subtle patterns in seismic data, even when the signals are buried in noise. This capability is particularly important in the context of citizen science initiatives, where data quality can vary significantly. The study highlights that CNNs can provide a reliable and efficient means of detecting weak seismic events, which is crucial for improving the completeness of seismic catalogs.  

In addition to their use in signal denoising, pattern recognition, and event detection, CNNs have also been employed in the analysis of seismic waveforms for applications such as fault zone characterization and subsurface imaging. The study "Seismic-phase detection using multiple deep learning models for global and local representations of waveforms" [23] presents a novel approach to seismic phase detection that utilizes CNNs to capture both global and local features of seismic waveforms. The authors emphasize that the ability of CNNs to learn complex representations of seismic data makes them well-suited for tasks that require a detailed understanding of wave propagation characteristics. This research demonstrates that CNNs can significantly enhance the accuracy of seismic phase detection, which is a critical component of earthquake monitoring and early warning systems.  

The use of CNNs in seismic data analysis has also been extended to the field of seismic inversion, where the goal is to estimate subsurface properties from seismic observations. The study "Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction" [10] explores the application of CNNs in modeling fault friction parameters, which are essential for understanding the mechanics of earthquake nucleation and propagation. The authors propose a multi-network CNN that incorporates physical constraints to improve the accuracy of parameter estimation. The study highlights that the integration of CNNs with physics-based models can lead to more reliable and interpretable results, which is particularly important for applications involving seismic hazard assessment.  

In conclusion, CNNs have become a cornerstone of seismic data analysis, offering a range of benefits for tasks such as signal denoising, pattern recognition, and the detection of seismic events. Their ability to automatically learn complex features from raw data has made them an attractive choice for researchers and practitioners in the field of earthquake engineering. As demonstrated in various studies, the use of CNNs can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of seismic monitoring and prediction systems, making them an essential tool in the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impacts of earthquakes.

### 4.4 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for Time-Series Analysis

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their advanced variant, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have become essential tools in analyzing time-series seismic data due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies and patterns. Seismic data is inherently sequential, with time-dependent characteristics that reflect the dynamic nature of earthquake events. Traditional methods often struggle to process such data effectively, making RNNs and LSTMs a compelling choice for their unique architecture that mimics the way the human brain processes sequential information. These models are particularly useful in earthquake detection and prediction, where capturing the temporal evolution of seismic signals is crucial for accurate analysis.

RNNs are a class of artificial neural networks designed to process sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures information about previous inputs. This allows them to model complex temporal dependencies, making them well-suited for tasks such as earthquake detection, where the sequence of seismic waveforms is critical for identifying patterns. However, standard RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which limits their ability to learn long-term dependencies. To address this limitation, LSTMs were introduced as a specialized type of RNN with memory cells that can retain information over long periods, making them ideal for handling the long-range temporal dependencies present in seismic data.

The application of RNNs and LSTMs in seismic data analysis has been extensively explored in recent studies. For instance, in the paper titled "A Deep Neural Network to identify foreshocks in real time" [72], the authors demonstrate how deep learning models, including RNNs and LSTMs, can be used to detect and classify foreshocks, mainshocks, and aftershocks with high accuracy. The study highlights the ability of these models to process continuous seismic waveforms and identify subtle temporal patterns that may indicate the onset of an earthquake. By leveraging the temporal modeling capabilities of RNNs and LSTMs, the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of over 99%, demonstrating the effectiveness of these models in real-time earthquake detection.

Another study, "Real-time Earthquake Early Warning with Deep Learning" [5], explores the use of RNNs and LSTMs for real-time earthquake early warning systems. The authors propose a deep learning framework that utilizes fully convolutional networks to detect earthquakes and estimate their source parameters from continuous seismic waveform streams. The system is designed to determine earthquake locations and magnitudes as soon as one station receives earthquake signals, with the solutions evolving as more data is received. The study shows that the system can reliably report earthquake locations and magnitudes within four seconds after the first triggered station, with mean errors of 6.8-3.7 km and 0.31-0.23, respectively. The use of RNNs and LSTMs in this context is crucial for capturing the temporal evolution of seismic signals and providing timely and accurate alerts.

In addition to real-time detection, RNNs and LSTMs are also valuable for improving the accuracy of earthquake prediction. The paper "Earthquake Nowcasting with Deep Learning" [21] presents a deep learning approach for nowcasting earthquakes using recurrent neural networks and transformers. The study focuses on predicting earthquake activity as a function of 0.1-degree spatial bins over varying time periods, from two weeks to four years. By leveraging the temporal modeling capabilities of RNNs and LSTMs, the authors achieve promising initial results for a region of Southern California from 1950-2020. The overall quality of the predictions is measured using the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency, which compares the deviation of nowcast and observation with the variance over time in each spatial region. This study highlights the potential of RNNs and LSTMs in capturing long-term temporal patterns and improving the accuracy of earthquake prediction.

The effectiveness of RNNs and LSTMs in analyzing seismic data is further supported by the study "CRED: A Deep Residual Network of Convolutional and Recurrent Units for Earthquake Signal Detection" [34]. The paper introduces the CRED model, a detector based on deep neural networks that combines convolutional layers with bi-directional long-short-term memory units in a residual structure. The network learns the time-frequency characteristics of the dominant phases in an earthquake signal from three component data recorded on a single station. The model is trained using 500,000 seismograms and tested with an F-score of 99.95. The robustness of the trained model with respect to the noise level and non-earthquake signals is shown by applying it to a set of semi-synthetic signals. The study demonstrates that RNNs and LSTMs can effectively detect small and weak earthquakes, even in the presence of significant background noise, making them invaluable tools for seismic monitoring.

Moreover, the application of RNNs and LSTMs extends beyond detection and prediction to include other critical aspects of earthquake engineering. In "Deep learning for laboratory earthquake prediction and autoregressive forecasting of fault zone stress" [20], the authors explore the use of deep learning methods, including LSTMs, for predicting laboratory earthquakes and forecasting fault zone stress. The study demonstrates that LSTMs can effectively model the temporal dependencies in fault zone stress data, leading to accurate predictions of earthquake events. The autoregressive (AR) methods used in this study allow forecasting at future horizons via iterative predictions, further enhancing the capabilities of RNNs and LSTMs in earthquake research.

In conclusion, RNNs and LSTMs have proven to be powerful tools for analyzing time-series seismic data, capturing temporal dependencies, and improving the accuracy of earthquake detection and prediction. Their ability to model complex temporal patterns makes them well-suited for a wide range of applications in earthquake engineering, from real-time early warning systems to long-term prediction models. The studies cited above provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of these models in addressing the challenges of seismic data analysis, and their continued development is expected to further enhance their capabilities in this critical domain.

### 4.5 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Seismic Data Generation and Enhancement

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool for generating synthetic seismic data and improving the detection of seismic signals. GANs consist of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator aims to produce realistic seismic data, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of the generated data. This adversarial process leads to the generation of high-quality synthetic data that can closely resemble real-world seismic signals. GANs are particularly useful in earthquake engineering, where the availability of labeled data is often limited, and the data can be noisy and complex [28; 15]. 

One of the primary applications of GANs in earthquake engineering is the generation of synthetic seismic data. This is crucial because the quality and quantity of data are essential for training robust machine learning models. GANs can generate diverse and realistic seismic signals, which can be used to augment the training datasets. For example, the SeismoGen paper discusses the use of GANs to generate synthetic seismic waveforms, which can be used to improve the detection accuracy of earthquake events. By generating synthetic data, GANs help address the issue of data scarcity and enhance the generalization capabilities of machine learning models [28].

In addition to generating synthetic data, GANs can also be used to enhance the quality of real-world seismic data. Real-world seismic data is often contaminated with noise, making it challenging to extract meaningful patterns. GANs can be trained to remove noise from seismic signals, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio. The Deep Autoassociative Neural Networks for Noise Reduction in Seismic data paper explores the potential of autoassociative neural networks (autoNNs) in reducing random noise in geophysical data. While autoNNs are a type of neural network, the principles behind their noise reduction capabilities can be extended to GANs, which can be trained to denoise seismic data more effectively. By reducing noise, GANs can help in improving the accuracy of seismic data analysis and enhancing the performance of machine learning models [29].

Another important application of GANs in earthquake engineering is the enhancement of seismic data for better model training and prediction. GANs can be used to generate synthetic data that is representative of various seismic scenarios, allowing machine learning models to learn from a diverse set of examples. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios where real-world data is limited or not representative of all possible seismic events. The SeisT paper discusses the use of a foundational deep learning model, the Seismogram Transformer (SeisT), for various earthquake monitoring tasks. By incorporating GANs into the training process, SeisT can be further enhanced to handle a broader range of seismic events, leading to improved performance and reliability [15].

Moreover, GANs can be employed to address the issue of data imbalance in seismic data. In many cases, seismic data is imbalanced, with a limited number of examples for certain seismic events. GANs can generate additional examples for underrepresented seismic events, thereby improving the performance of machine learning models. The paper "Seismic Facies Analysis: A Deep Domain Adaptation Approach" highlights the challenges of training deep neural networks (DNNs) when labeled data is scarce. By using GANs to generate synthetic data, DNNs can be trained more effectively, leading to improved performance in seismic facies classification tasks [83].

In addition to generating synthetic data, GANs can be used to improve the interpretability of seismic data. The Explainable AI models for predicting liquefaction-induced lateral spreading paper emphasizes the importance of interpretability in machine learning models for seismic applications. GANs can be used to generate synthetic data that is more interpretable, allowing engineers and researchers to better understand the underlying patterns in the data. By enhancing the interpretability of seismic data, GANs can contribute to the development of more transparent and reliable machine learning models [17].

The application of GANs in seismic data generation and enhancement is not limited to the generation of synthetic data. GANs can also be used to improve the quality of real-world seismic data by learning the underlying patterns and structures. The paper "Seismic Phase Detection Using Multiple Deep Learning Models for Global and Local Representations of Waveforms" discusses the importance of capturing both global and local representations of seismic waveforms. By training GANs to learn these representations, the quality of the seismic data can be improved, leading to better performance in seismic phase detection tasks [23].

Furthermore, GANs can be used to address the issue of data privacy in seismic data. In many cases, seismic data is sensitive and cannot be shared freely. GANs can be used to generate synthetic data that mimics the statistical properties of the real data, allowing researchers to work with synthetic data while preserving the privacy of the original data. This is particularly important in applications where the data is confidential or restricted [83].

In conclusion, GANs offer a powerful approach for generating synthetic seismic data and enhancing the quality of real-world seismic data. By addressing the challenges of data scarcity, noise, and imbalance, GANs can significantly improve the performance of machine learning models in earthquake engineering. The applications of GANs in seismic data generation and enhancement are diverse and impactful, making them an essential tool in the field of earthquake engineering. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of GANs into seismic data processing workflows will play a crucial role in advancing the capabilities of machine learning models in earthquake detection and prediction [28; 29; 15; 83; 17; 23].

### 4.6 Deep Learning for Foreshock and Mainshock Classification

[18]
Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in the classification of seismic events, particularly in distinguishing between foreshocks, mainshocks, and aftershocks. These classifications are crucial for improving the accuracy of earthquake prediction and understanding the complex dynamics of seismic activity. By leveraging deep learning models, researchers have been able to develop more sophisticated algorithms that can detect and classify these events with higher precision, thereby contributing to more effective earthquake monitoring and early warning systems.

One of the key applications of deep learning in this context is the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to analyze seismic data. These models are designed to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in seismic signals, which are essential for distinguishing between different types of seismic events. For instance, the work presented in the paper titled "A Deep Convolutional Network for Seismic Shot-Gather Image Quality Classification" highlights the effectiveness of CNNs in classifying seismic shot gathers, which can be extended to the classification of foreshocks, mainshocks, and aftershocks. The ability of CNNs to extract meaningful features from seismic data makes them well-suited for this task, as they can identify subtle patterns that may be indicative of different seismic phases [86].

Another important aspect of deep learning in seismic event classification is the use of recurrent neural networks, which are particularly effective in handling sequential data. RNNs, including long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, can capture temporal dependencies in seismic data, which is crucial for understanding the evolution of seismic events over time. The paper "Seismic Phase Detection Using Multiple Deep Learning Models for Global and Local Representations of Waveforms" discusses the use of deep learning models to detect seismic phases, including foreshocks and aftershocks. By leveraging both global and local representations of waveforms, these models can provide a more comprehensive understanding of seismic events, leading to more accurate classifications [23].

In addition to CNNs and RNNs, other deep learning architectures, such as autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs), have also been explored for seismic event classification. Autoencoders, as discussed in the paper "Deep Autoassociative Neural Networks for Noise Reduction in Seismic data," are capable of learning efficient representations of seismic data, which can be used to improve the accuracy of classification tasks. By reducing noise and extracting relevant features, autoencoders can enhance the performance of deep learning models in distinguishing between different types of seismic events [29].

GANs, on the other hand, have been used to generate synthetic seismic data, which can be used to augment training datasets and improve the generalization of deep learning models. The paper "SeismiQB -- a novel framework for deep learning with seismic data" highlights the importance of using GANs to generate high-quality synthetic seismic data. This approach can be particularly useful in scenarios where the availability of labeled data is limited, as it allows researchers to train deep learning models on a more diverse set of seismic events, including foreshocks, mainshocks, and aftershocks [123].

The integration of physics-informed deep learning models has also shown promise in improving the accuracy of seismic event classification. By incorporating physical laws and constraints into the training process, these models can better capture the underlying dynamics of seismic events. The paper "Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Seismic Response Prediction OF Nonlinear Steel Moment Resisting Frame Structures" discusses the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to model seismic responses. These models can be adapted to the classification of seismic events by incorporating physical constraints, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions [7].

Furthermore, the use of hybrid models that combine deep learning with traditional seismic analysis techniques has been shown to enhance the performance of seismic event classification. For example, the paper "Combining Deep Learning with Physics Based Features in Explosion-Earthquake Discrimination" presents a method that combines deep learning with physics-based features to improve the discrimination between earthquakes and explosions. This approach can be extended to the classification of foreshocks, mainshocks, and aftershocks by incorporating relevant physical features into the deep learning model [85].

Another important consideration in the classification of seismic events is the need for explainable AI. As deep learning models become more complex, it is essential to understand how they make predictions, especially in critical applications such as earthquake prediction. The paper "Explainable Artificial Intelligence driven mask design for self-supervised seismic denoising" highlights the importance of developing explainable AI techniques to gain insights into the decision-making processes of deep learning models. By making these models more interpretable, researchers can better understand the factors that influence the classification of seismic events and improve the accuracy of predictions [124].

The challenges associated with data scarcity and model generalization are also significant in the context of deep learning for seismic event classification. The paper "Deep Learning for Foreshock and Mainshock Classification" addresses these challenges by exploring the use of transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques. These approaches can help overcome the limitations of data scarcity by leveraging pre-trained models and adapting them to new seismic datasets, thereby improving the performance of deep learning models in classifying different types of seismic events [72].

In addition to these technical considerations, the ethical and societal implications of using deep learning for seismic event classification cannot be overlooked. The paper "Machine Learning in Acoustics: Theory and Applications" discusses the importance of ensuring that deep learning models are fair, transparent, and accountable. These principles are particularly relevant in the context of earthquake prediction, where the accuracy and reliability of models can have significant consequences for public safety and disaster management [125].

Overall, the use of deep learning in the classification of foreshocks, mainshocks, and aftershocks represents a significant advancement in earthquake prediction. By leveraging the power of deep learning models, researchers can develop more accurate and reliable methods for understanding and predicting seismic events. The integration of physics-informed techniques, the use of synthetic data, and the development of explainable AI are all critical components of this effort, and they highlight the potential of deep learning to revolutionize the field of earthquake engineering.

### 4.7 Deep Learning in Seismic Phase Detection

Deep learning has emerged as a transformative force in seismology, particularly in the realm of seismic phase detection. Traditional methods for phase picking, such as the Short-Term-Average to Long-Term-Average (STA/LTA) trigger, have been widely used but suffer from limitations such as sensitivity to noise, parameter tuning, and poor performance in complex seismic environments [126]. These limitations have spurred the development of deep learning techniques that aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of seismic phase detection. 

One notable contribution in this area is the work by [23], where the authors proposed a novel phase detection method employing deep learning. This method is based on a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) in a new framework. The novelty of the proposed method lies in its separate explicit learning strategy for global and local representations of waveforms, which enhances its robustness and flexibility. By identifying local representations of the waveform through multiple clustering of waveforms, the authors were able to consider both global and local representations. Different phase detection models were then trained for each global and local representation. For a new waveform, the overall phase probability was evaluated as a product of the phase probabilities of each model. This approach was shown to be robust to noise, as demonstrated by its application to test data. Additionally, an application to seismic swarm data demonstrated the robust performance of the proposed method compared with those of other deep learning methods. The flexibility of the proposed method was also highlighted through its ability to be adapted for the detection of low-frequency earthquakes by retraining only a local model. 

Another significant contribution is the work by [28], where the authors explored the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for seismic waveform synthesis. By generating synthetic seismic data, the authors aimed to address the issue of data scarcity in training deep learning models. This approach not only enhances the training of models but also improves their robustness and generalization capabilities. The use of GANs in this context highlights the potential of generative models to augment real-world data, thereby improving the accuracy of phase detection.

The integration of deep learning with physics-based models has also been explored in the context of seismic phase detection. [10] presented a multi-network physics-informed neural network (PINN) for both the forward problem and the direct inversion of nonlinear fault friction parameters. This approach ensures that model outcomes satisfy rigorous physical constraints, making it particularly suitable for applications where physical consistency is crucial. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of their PINN framework in capturing the dynamics of fault friction, which is essential for accurate phase detection and earthquake prediction.

In the context of real-time seismic monitoring, the work by [20] is noteworthy. The authors utilized deep learning methods, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to predict labquakes and forecast fault zone stress. The ability to predict the time to failure (TTsF) and the time to the end of failure (TTeF) in labquakes showcases the potential of deep learning in capturing temporal dependencies and predicting phase transitions in seismic events.

Moreover, the application of deep learning in seismic phase detection has been further advanced by the work of [35], where the authors examined the applicability of modern neural network architectures to the midterm prediction of earthquakes. Their model incorporated both recurrent and convolutional parts to account for temporal and spatial dependencies, respectively. The results demonstrated that neural networks-based models outperformed baseline feature-based models, highlighting the potential of deep learning in capturing complex spatiotemporal patterns in seismic data.

The use of deep learning in seismic phase detection has also been explored in the context of structural health monitoring. [79] introduced a physics-guided convolutional neural network (PhyCNN) framework for data-driven seismic response modeling. This approach leverages the principles of physics to guide the learning process, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of predictions. The PhyCNN model was able to accurately predict building seismic response without the need for a physics-based analytical model, demonstrating the potential of deep learning in integrating domain-specific knowledge.

Additionally, [107] provided a comprehensive overview of the application of deep learning techniques in spatio-temporal data mining. The survey highlighted the effectiveness of deep learning models, such as CNNs and RNNs, in capturing spatiotemporal dependencies in seismic data. This work underscored the importance of deep learning in extracting meaningful patterns from complex seismic data, which is crucial for accurate phase detection.

The integration of deep learning with traditional seismic monitoring workflows has also been explored. [78] proposed a graph neural network that operates directly on multi-station seismic data and achieves simultaneous phase picking, association, and location. This approach not only improves accuracy but also enhances interpretability and physical consistency among cross-station and cross-task predictions. The results demonstrated superior performance over previous deep learning-based phase-picking and localization methods, highlighting the potential of deep learning in achieving more comprehensive seismic monitoring.

Overall, deep learning has significantly advanced the field of seismic phase detection by enhancing accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. The integration of deep learning with physics-based models, the use of generative models to augment training data, and the development of novel architectures such as graph neural networks and physics-informed neural networks have all contributed to the progress in this area. As the field continues to evolve, further research is needed to address the challenges of data scarcity, model generalization, and the integration of domain-specific knowledge. The ongoing development of deep learning techniques promises to further revolutionize seismic phase detection and improve our understanding of seismic events.

### 4.8 Deep Learning for Earthquake Localization and Magnitude Estimation

Deep learning has significantly advanced the field of earthquake localization and magnitude estimation, offering more accurate and reliable methods compared to traditional approaches. The integration of deep learning algorithms into seismic monitoring systems has enabled faster and more precise determination of earthquake locations and magnitudes, which are critical for early warning systems and disaster response strategies. Unlike conventional methods that rely on manual interpretation of seismic data or physics-based models, deep learning models can automatically extract meaningful patterns and features from large volumes of seismic data, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of earthquake monitoring.

One of the key advantages of deep learning in earthquake localization is its ability to process multivariate time-series data from seismic stations. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully employed to detect and locate earthquakes by analyzing the spatial and temporal patterns of seismic signals [36]. CNNs are particularly effective in capturing the complex, nonlinear relationships between seismic waveforms and their corresponding source locations. By training on large datasets of labeled seismic events, CNNs can learn to identify subtle features that distinguish different earthquake sources, leading to more accurate localization results.

In addition to CNNs, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, have also been applied to earthquake localization. These models are well-suited for handling sequential data and can capture the temporal dependencies in seismic waveforms. For example, an LSTM network trained on a dataset of seismic recordings can learn to predict the time delays between different seismic stations, which are essential for triangulating the location of an earthquake [37]. The ability of RNNs to process time-series data in a sequential manner makes them particularly useful for real-time earthquake monitoring, where quick and accurate location estimation is crucial.

Another important application of deep learning in earthquake localization is the use of graph neural networks (GNNs), which are designed to model relationships between different seismic stations. GNNs can effectively capture the spatial correlations between seismic data collected from multiple stations, leading to more accurate and robust localization results. For instance, a GNN-based model can be trained to learn the relationships between different seismic stations and their corresponding seismic waveforms, allowing it to predict the source location of an earthquake with high precision [89]. This approach is particularly beneficial in regions with dense seismic networks, where the spatial distribution of seismic stations can provide valuable information for earthquake localization.

In addition to localization, deep learning has also been used to estimate earthquake magnitudes, which is a critical parameter for assessing the potential impact of an earthquake. Traditional magnitude estimation methods rely on empirical relationships between seismic waveforms and earthquake magnitudes, which can be limited in their accuracy and generalizability. Deep learning models, on the other hand, can learn complex, nonlinear relationships between seismic data and earthquake magnitudes, leading to more accurate magnitude estimates.

One of the most promising approaches for earthquake magnitude estimation is the use of autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate synthetic seismic data and improve the training of deep learning models. For example, a study demonstrated that the use of GANs to generate synthetic seismic data can significantly improve the performance of deep learning models in estimating earthquake magnitudes [39]. By augmenting the training data with synthetic samples, deep learning models can better generalize to different seismic scenarios, leading to more accurate magnitude estimates.

Another key application of deep learning in earthquake magnitude estimation is the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which integrate physical laws and domain knowledge into the training process. By incorporating physical constraints into the loss function, PINNs can improve the accuracy and reliability of magnitude estimates. For instance, a PINN-based model trained on a dataset of seismic waveforms can learn to predict the magnitude of an earthquake by enforcing physical constraints such as energy conservation and wave propagation laws [110]. This approach not only improves the accuracy of magnitude estimates but also enhances the interpretability of the model, making it more suitable for real-world applications.

In addition to standalone deep learning models, hybrid approaches that combine deep learning with physics-based models have also been explored for earthquake localization and magnitude estimation. For example, a study proposed a hybrid model that integrates a CNN with a physics-based wave propagation model to improve the accuracy of earthquake localization [85]. By combining the strengths of both deep learning and physics-based models, hybrid approaches can provide more accurate and reliable results, especially in complex geological environments.

Another important aspect of deep learning in earthquake localization and magnitude estimation is the use of transfer learning to overcome data scarcity and improve model generalization. Transfer learning involves pre-training a deep learning model on a large dataset of seismic data and then fine-tuning it on a smaller dataset specific to a particular region or seismic scenario. This approach has been shown to be effective in improving the performance of deep learning models in earthquake localization and magnitude estimation [127]. By leveraging knowledge from related domains, transfer learning can significantly reduce the need for extensive labeled data, making it easier to deploy deep learning models in regions with limited seismic data.

Furthermore, the use of semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning techniques has also been explored for earthquake localization and magnitude estimation. These methods can effectively leverage unlabeled seismic data to improve the performance of deep learning models. For instance, a semi-supervised learning approach that combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) has been proposed to detect anomalies in seismic data and improve the accuracy of earthquake localization [42]. Similarly, self-supervised learning methods that use contrastive learning have been shown to be effective in learning meaningful representations of seismic data, which can be used for earthquake localization and magnitude estimation [128].

In summary, deep learning has revolutionized the field of earthquake localization and magnitude estimation by providing more accurate, efficient, and reliable methods for seismic monitoring. The integration of deep learning algorithms with physics-based models, the use of transfer learning to overcome data scarcity, and the application of semi-supervised and self-supervised learning techniques have all contributed to the advancement of earthquake monitoring systems. These developments have the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of earthquake detection and prediction, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of early warning systems and disaster response strategies.

### 4.9 Integration of Deep Learning with Physics-Based Models for Earthquake Prediction

The integration of deep learning with physics-based models has emerged as a critical strategy to enhance the accuracy, physical consistency, and interpretability of earthquake prediction systems. Traditional physics-based models, such as those grounded in seismology, geophysics, and structural engineering, rely on complex mathematical formulations and empirical relationships to simulate seismic phenomena. While these models provide a rigorous foundation, they often struggle with data scarcity, computational inefficiency, and the inability to capture nonlinear and high-dimensional interactions inherent in seismic processes. Deep learning models, on the other hand, excel at learning patterns from large datasets and can handle complex, unstructured data. However, they lack the ability to inherently respect the physical laws governing seismic systems, which can lead to predictions that are statistically accurate but physically inconsistent. The fusion of these two paradigms has thus become a promising avenue for advancing earthquake prediction, as it leverages the strengths of both deep learning and physics-based modeling.

One of the most notable approaches in this integration is the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). PINNs explicitly incorporate the governing equations of physics into the training process of neural networks, ensuring that predictions adhere to the underlying physical laws. This approach not only improves the consistency of the model with the physical world but also enhances its generalizability, especially in data-scarce scenarios [47]. For example, in earthquake prediction, PINNs can embed equations of motion, stress-strain relationships, and energy conservation laws into their architecture, ensuring that the model's outputs align with the known principles of seismology. By combining the flexibility of deep learning with the rigor of physics, PINNs provide a robust framework for predicting earthquake behavior and improving the reliability of seismic forecasts [129].

Another significant advancement in this domain is the development of hybrid AI-physical models, which combine deep learning with traditional physics-based simulations. These models aim to improve the efficiency and accuracy of earthquake prediction by leveraging the strengths of both approaches. For instance, deep learning can be used to learn complex, nonlinear relationships between input parameters and seismic outputs, while physics-based models can provide the necessary constraints to ensure the predictions are physically meaningful. This hybrid approach has been successfully applied in areas such as seismic inversion, where deep learning models are trained to predict subsurface properties based on seismic data, while physics-based constraints ensure that the model's outputs remain consistent with the governing equations of wave propagation [49].

Moreover, the integration of deep learning with physics-based models has also led to the development of physics-informed digital twins, which are virtual replicas of real-world seismic systems. These digital twins leverage deep learning to simulate and predict the behavior of complex earthquake-prone regions, while physics-based models ensure that the simulations remain grounded in the physical laws governing seismic activity. By continuously updating the digital twin with real-time data, this approach enables the dynamic monitoring and prediction of seismic events with high accuracy and reliability [130]. This has significant implications for disaster management, as it allows for the early identification of potential seismic risks and the development of targeted mitigation strategies.

Another key benefit of integrating deep learning with physics-based models is the ability to handle the uncertainty and variability inherent in seismic data. Seismic data is often noisy, incomplete, and subject to spatial and temporal variations, making it challenging for traditional models to produce accurate predictions. Deep learning models trained with physics-informed constraints can mitigate these challenges by incorporating prior knowledge of the physical system into their training process. For example, by embedding the equations of motion and stress-strain relationships into the loss function of the neural network, the model can learn to generalize better from sparse and noisy data, resulting in more accurate and reliable predictions [92]. This is particularly important in earthquake prediction, where the ability to distinguish between noise and meaningful seismic signals can significantly impact the effectiveness of early warning systems.

Furthermore, the integration of deep learning with physics-based models has also facilitated the development of more interpretable and explainable earthquake prediction systems. While deep learning models are often criticized for their "black-box" nature, the inclusion of physics-based constraints can help make their predictions more transparent and understandable. For instance, by embedding physical laws into the model's architecture, it becomes possible to trace the contributions of different input parameters to the final prediction, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of seismic activity. This increased interpretability is crucial for building trust in AI-driven earthquake prediction systems, especially in high-stakes applications such as infrastructure safety and disaster response [47].

In addition to improving the accuracy and reliability of predictions, the integration of deep learning with physics-based models has also led to the development of more computationally efficient solutions for earthquake prediction. Traditional physics-based models often require extensive computational resources and time to simulate complex seismic scenarios, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. Deep learning models, on the other hand, can be trained to approximate these simulations with significantly reduced computational overhead. By combining the efficiency of deep learning with the accuracy of physics-based models, researchers have developed hybrid approaches that can provide rapid and accurate predictions of seismic events, enabling timely decision-making in critical situations [92].

Overall, the integration of deep learning with physics-based models represents a transformative approach to earthquake prediction. By combining the flexibility and adaptability of deep learning with the rigor and consistency of physics-based models, researchers have developed more accurate, reliable, and interpretable systems for understanding and predicting seismic activity. This synergy has the potential to revolutionize earthquake engineering, enabling more effective risk assessment, early warning systems, and disaster management strategies. As the field continues to evolve, further research into the development of more sophisticated and efficient hybrid models will be essential for addressing the complex challenges of earthquake prediction and ensuring the safety and resilience of seismic-prone regions.

### 4.10 Deep Learning for Spatiotemporal Analysis of Earthquake Patterns

Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing spatiotemporal patterns of earthquakes, enabling the prediction of extreme seismic events and improving risk assessment. Traditional methods for earthquake analysis often rely on empirical models or physics-based simulations, which can be computationally expensive and limited in capturing complex, non-linear interactions in seismic data. Deep learning models, particularly those designed for sequence modeling and spatial pattern recognition, offer a promising alternative by automatically learning intricate relationships from large-scale seismic datasets. These models are increasingly used to detect and predict spatiotemporal patterns of seismic activity, providing critical insights for disaster preparedness and risk mitigation.

One of the most significant applications of deep learning in spatiotemporal analysis is the identification of complex seismic patterns that are difficult to capture using conventional approaches. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to detect spatial features in seismic data, such as the distribution of ground motion intensity across regions [20]. Additionally, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are particularly effective in capturing temporal dependencies in seismic time series, allowing for the prediction of future seismic events based on historical data [20]. The integration of these architectures into spatiotemporal models enables the analysis of seismic data across both spatial and temporal dimensions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of earthquake dynamics.

The ability of deep learning models to handle high-dimensional and heterogeneous data makes them particularly well-suited for spatiotemporal earthquake analysis. For instance, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been used to model the relationships between seismic stations and other geographical features, allowing for the identification of spatial correlations that might not be apparent in traditional analyses [78]. GNNs can effectively represent the network of seismic sensors and their interactions, enabling the prediction of earthquake propagation and the estimation of ground motion in unmonitored regions. This is particularly important in areas with sparse seismic instrumentation, where traditional methods may struggle to provide accurate predictions [90].

Another important aspect of spatiotemporal earthquake analysis is the detection of extreme seismic events, which pose the greatest risk to human life and infrastructure. Deep learning models have been developed to identify early warning signals of such events, leveraging the ability of these models to detect subtle patterns in large datasets. For example, researchers have used deep learning to analyze seismic waveforms and identify precursory signals that may indicate an impending large earthquake [16]. These models are trained on extensive seismic datasets, allowing them to learn the complex relationships between different seismic parameters and the likelihood of extreme events. The results of these studies highlight the potential of deep learning in improving early warning systems and reducing the impact of catastrophic earthquakes.

In addition to detecting extreme seismic events, deep learning is also being used to improve risk assessment by providing more accurate and detailed predictions of earthquake impacts. For instance, spatiotemporal models can be used to estimate the potential damage to buildings and infrastructure based on historical seismic data and current geological conditions [106]. These models take into account both the spatial distribution of seismic activity and the temporal evolution of ground motion, allowing for more precise risk assessments. By integrating deep learning with physics-based models, researchers can enhance the accuracy of these predictions, ensuring that they are grounded in scientific principles while still benefiting from the flexibility of data-driven approaches [10].

Another promising application of deep learning in spatiotemporal earthquake analysis is the use of generative models to synthesize seismic data and improve the robustness of predictive models. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and other generative models have been used to create synthetic seismic datasets that can be used to train and validate deep learning models, particularly in cases where real-world data is limited or noisy [131]. These synthetic datasets help to overcome the challenge of data scarcity, allowing researchers to develop more reliable and generalizable models for earthquake prediction and risk assessment.

Furthermore, the integration of deep learning with remote sensing data has opened new avenues for spatiotemporal earthquake analysis. Satellite imagery and other remote sensing data provide valuable information about the spatial distribution of seismic activity, enabling the identification of regions at high risk of earthquakes [120]. Deep learning models have been used to analyze these images and detect changes in the environment that may be indicative of seismic activity. For example, researchers have used deep learning to monitor the evolution of fault lines and predict the likelihood of future earthquakes based on observed surface deformations [10].

The use of deep learning in spatiotemporal earthquake analysis also extends to the development of real-time monitoring systems. These systems leverage the speed and efficiency of deep learning models to process large volumes of seismic data and provide immediate insights into ongoing seismic activity. For instance, deep learning models have been deployed to monitor seismic networks and detect anomalies in real-time, enabling the rapid identification of potential earthquakes [22]. The ability to process data in real-time is critical for early warning systems, as it allows for timely alerts and the implementation of mitigation strategies before significant damage occurs.

In conclusion, deep learning has significantly advanced the field of spatiotemporal earthquake analysis by enabling the detection of complex seismic patterns, the prediction of extreme seismic events, and the improvement of risk assessment methodologies. The integration of deep learning with physics-based models, remote sensing data, and real-time monitoring systems has further enhanced the accuracy and reliability of these predictions. As research in this area continues to evolve, deep learning is expected to play an increasingly important role in earthquake engineering, contributing to the development of more effective strategies for disaster preparedness and risk mitigation.

## 5 Machine Learning in Structural Health Monitoring and Damage Detection

### 5.1 Machine Learning Techniques for Structural Damage Detection

Machine learning techniques have become a transformative force in structural health monitoring and damage detection, offering a robust and scalable approach to identify, assess, and predict structural integrity issues in bridges, buildings, and critical infrastructure. These techniques encompass a wide range of methodologies, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning, each with unique strengths and applications in detecting structural damage. The integration of machine learning into structural health monitoring (SHM) has addressed the limitations of traditional methods, which often rely on manual inspections, expensive sensors, and time-consuming data analysis. By leveraging data-driven approaches, machine learning enables automated, real-time, and accurate detection of damage, significantly improving the efficiency and reliability of structural assessments.

Supervised learning is a fundamental approach in structural damage detection, where algorithms are trained on labeled datasets to recognize patterns associated with structural damage. These datasets typically include features such as vibration signals, strain measurements, and acoustic emissions, which are labeled as either damaged or undamaged. For instance, the study by [6] demonstrated the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify building damage into categories such as "no damage," "minor damage," "major damage," and "collapse." The model achieved an impressive validation accuracy of 89.38%, highlighting the effectiveness of supervised learning in damage classification. Another example is the work by [93], which utilized supervised learning to predict stress distributions in structural components based on finite element simulations. These models are particularly useful in scenarios where historical data on damage events are available and can be used to train accurate predictive models.

Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, is employed when labeled data is scarce or unavailable. This approach relies on clustering and anomaly detection techniques to identify patterns and deviations in structural behavior that may indicate damage. For example, the study by [132] used clustering algorithms to detect anomalies in sensor data, which could indicate potential structural failures. Similarly, the work by [133] applied one-class learning techniques such as FCDD to detect damage in structural systems. These models are trained on data from undamaged structures and can identify deviations that may signal the onset of damage. Unsupervised learning is particularly valuable in scenarios where the nature of damage is unknown or difficult to categorize.

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has gained significant traction in structural damage detection due to its ability to process complex and high-dimensional data. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have shown remarkable performance in tasks such as image recognition, time-series analysis, and pattern recognition. For instance, the study by [76] proposed a hybrid model combining CNN and BiLSTM to detect seismic events and predict earthquake magnitudes. The model was trained on a large dataset of seismic waveforms and demonstrated high accuracy in detecting foreshocks and mainshocks. Another example is the work by [20], which utilized deep learning techniques to predict fault zone stress and forecast laboratory earthquakes. These models are particularly effective in handling large and complex datasets, making them ideal for real-time damage detection in structural systems.

In addition to these approaches, hybrid models that combine machine learning with physics-based models have emerged as a promising solution for structural damage detection. These models leverage the strengths of both data-driven and physics-based methods to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions. For example, the study by [7] proposed a physics-informed machine learning (PiML) method that incorporates scientific principles and physical laws into deep neural networks. The model was trained on data from nonlinear steel moment-resisting frame structures and demonstrated superior performance in predicting seismic responses. Another example is the work by [92], which developed a physics-informed recurrent neural network (PiRNN) to evaluate the seismic response of nonlinear systems. These models are particularly useful in scenarios where the underlying physical mechanisms are well understood, as they can provide more interpretable and physically consistent predictions.

Transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques have also been explored to address the challenge of data scarcity in structural damage detection. These techniques involve training models on data from related domains and adapting them to the target domain. For instance, the study by [134] demonstrated the effectiveness of transfer learning in detecting structural damage using pre-trained models. The model was trained on data from a different structural system and adapted to the target domain, resulting in improved performance. Similarly, the work by [20] utilized transfer learning to improve the generalization of deep learning models across different structural systems. These techniques are particularly valuable in scenarios where labeled data is limited, as they enable the transfer of knowledge from related domains to the target domain.

Explainable and interpretable machine learning models are also gaining attention in structural damage detection, as they provide insights into the decision-making process of the models. These models are particularly important in critical applications where transparency and interpretability are essential. For example, the study by [52] proposed an explainable boosting machine (EBM) model to predict the deformation capacity of non-ductile reinforced concrete shear walls. The model provided clear insights into the factors influencing the deformation capacity, making it more transparent and interpretable. Another example is the work by [17], which utilized SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret the predictions of an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model. These models are particularly valuable in scenarios where the decisions made by the models need to be justified and understood by engineers and stakeholders.

In conclusion, machine learning techniques have revolutionized the field of structural damage detection, offering a wide range of methods to identify, assess, and predict structural integrity issues. Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning each have their unique strengths and applications, while hybrid models and transfer learning techniques address the challenges of data scarcity and model generalization. The integration of explainable and interpretable models further enhances the transparency and reliability of predictions, making machine learning an indispensable tool in structural health monitoring and damage detection. As the field continues to evolve, the development of more advanced and efficient machine learning models will play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and resilience of critical infrastructure.

### 5.2 Deep Learning Approaches for Damage Detection

Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for structural health monitoring and damage detection, offering the ability to process high-dimensional, complex, and heterogeneous data. In the context of structural damage detection, deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown remarkable performance in classifying and detecting damage in structures. These models excel at processing complex data such as vibration signals, images, and time-series data, which are commonly encountered in structural health monitoring systems [135].

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely used for damage detection in structures, particularly in analyzing vibration data and images. CNNs are well-suited for image-based damage detection due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from raw image data. For example, in the study by [4], researchers used CNNs to classify the seismic failure modes of reinforced concrete shear walls by analyzing vibration data. The model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting the type of failure, making it a valuable tool for structural health monitoring. Additionally, [136] highlights the use of CNNs for detecting structural damage in images, including satellite and drone-based imagery. By leveraging the spatial hierarchies in images, CNNs can accurately identify cracks, deformations, and other forms of damage in structures.

In addition to image-based approaches, time-series data from vibration sensors are also commonly used for damage detection. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are well-suited for processing such sequential data. LSTMs are designed to remember long-term dependencies, making them ideal for analyzing vibration signals that may contain subtle changes indicative of damage. For example, [10] discusses the use of LSTM networks to model the temporal dependencies in vibration data, allowing for more accurate predictions of structural behavior under dynamic loads. Another study, [137], presents a deep learning model that integrates physical constraints into the network architecture to improve the accuracy of vibration signal processing and damage detection. The model demonstrates superior performance in capturing the energy dynamics of structures under seismic loads, making it a promising approach for real-time monitoring.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have also been applied in structural damage detection, particularly for generating synthetic data and improving the robustness of damage detection models. GANs can generate realistic vibration signals and images that mimic real-world damage scenarios, which can be used to augment training datasets and improve model generalization. For instance, [131] highlights the use of GANs for synthesizing seismic data and enhancing the training of machine learning models. In the context of structural health monitoring, GANs can generate synthetic vibration signals that simulate different types of damage, allowing models to learn and detect subtle changes in structural behavior. This is particularly useful in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.

In addition to these models, hybrid approaches combining deep learning with physics-based models have shown promise in improving the accuracy and interpretability of damage detection systems. For example, [138] demonstrate the integration of physical laws into deep learning models to ensure that the predictions of structural damage are consistent with known physical principles. This approach not only improves the accuracy of damage detection but also enhances the interpretability of the model, which is critical in engineering applications. Similarly, [10] explores the use of PINNs for modeling the complex interactions between fault mechanics and structural behavior, providing insights into the mechanisms of damage propagation.

Another important aspect of deep learning for damage detection is the ability to handle high-dimensional data and extract meaningful features. Deep learning models, such as CNNs and LSTMs, are capable of automatically learning feature representations from raw data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering. This is particularly beneficial in structural health monitoring, where the data is often complex and heterogeneous. For instance, [12] uses Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to predict the energy dissipation capacity of shear walls, while [52] employs explainable boosting machines to predict the deformation capacity of non-ductile shear walls. These studies highlight the versatility of machine learning models in capturing the complex relationships between structural properties and damage behavior.

In addition to damage detection, deep learning models have also been used for anomaly detection in structural health monitoring systems. Anomalies in vibration data or sensor readings can indicate the presence of damage or degradation in structures. [122] discuss the use of unsupervised learning techniques for detecting anomalies in structural data, which can be particularly useful when labeled data is scarce. By leveraging the power of deep learning, these models can identify patterns and deviations that may be indicative of structural damage, even in the absence of explicit labels.

The effectiveness of deep learning models in structural damage detection is further supported by their ability to generalize across different types of structures and damage scenarios. For example, [139] presents a study that uses a variety of deep learning models to detect damage in 3D reinforced concrete buildings. The results show that deep learning models can accurately classify damage in different structural components, making them a valuable tool for large-scale structural health monitoring. Similarly, [51] explores the use of deep learning for real-time damage detection in bridges and other critical infrastructure, demonstrating the potential of these models in practical applications.

In summary, deep learning approaches such as CNNs, LSTMs, and GANs have shown significant potential in structural damage detection, offering the ability to process complex data and extract meaningful insights. These models are well-suited for analyzing vibration signals, images, and time-series data, and their performance in detecting and classifying structural damage has been validated by numerous studies. Furthermore, the integration of deep learning with physics-based models and the use of hybrid approaches have further improved the accuracy and interpretability of damage detection systems. As the field continues to evolve, deep learning is expected to play an increasingly important role in ensuring the safety and resilience of structures in the face of seismic events.

### 5.3 Real-Time Structural Health Monitoring Using Edge-AI

Real-time structural health monitoring (SHM) is a critical area within earthquake engineering, as it enables the continuous assessment of the integrity of infrastructure, such as buildings, bridges, and dams, in response to seismic events. Traditional methods for SHM often rely on centralized processing of data collected from numerous sensors, which can introduce latency and reduce the effectiveness of real-time decision-making. In recent years, the integration of edge-AI has emerged as a promising solution to overcome these limitations by enabling local processing and analysis at the sensor level, thereby reducing the need for extensive data transmission and improving response times. Edge-AI, which refers to the deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms on edge devices, such as microcontrollers or embedded systems, has gained significant attention due to its potential to enhance the efficiency and reliability of SHM systems.

One of the key advantages of edge-AI in SHM is its ability to process data in real-time, allowing for immediate detection of structural anomalies and damage. This is particularly important in earthquake-prone regions where timely responses can significantly mitigate the risk of catastrophic failures. For instance, the paper titled "Event-triggered Natural Hazard Monitoring with Convolutional Neural Networks on the Edge" [140] highlights the development of a wireless sensor network for hazard monitoring, which leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify seismic events at the edge. By implementing machine learning-based classification on low-power microcontrollers, this system reduces false positive warnings and actively identifies humans in hazard zones, demonstrating the potential of edge-AI in real-time monitoring applications.

Another critical aspect of edge-AI in SHM is its ability to reduce the computational burden on central servers. By processing data locally, edge devices can minimize the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the monitoring system. The paper titled "Seismic-Net: A Deep Densely Connected Neural Network to Detect Seismic Events" [97] presents a novel machine-learning detection package, named "Seismic-Net," which is based on a deep densely connected neural network. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in detecting $\mathrm{CO}_\mathrm{2}$ leakage by formulating the detection problem as an event detection task with time-series data. The use of a deep densely connected network to classify each window of data illustrates how edge-AI can be effectively applied to detect anomalies in real-time.

Moreover, the integration of edge-AI in SHM systems allows for more adaptive and scalable solutions. Traditional centralized systems often struggle to handle the increasing volume and complexity of data generated by modern sensor networks. In contrast, edge-AI enables the deployment of lightweight models that can be easily updated and adapted to changing conditions. The paper titled "Multi-resolution neural networks for tracking seismic horizons from few training images" [141] presents a framework that uses multi-resolution neural networks to track seismic horizons from a small number of training images. This approach demonstrates how edge-AI can be used to train models on limited data, making it suitable for real-time applications where data availability is constrained.

Edge-AI also plays a crucial role in enhancing the robustness and reliability of SHM systems. By decentralizing the processing and decision-making capabilities, edge-AI can reduce the risk of system-wide failures caused by the loss of communication or computational resources. The paper titled "ASSED -- A Framework for Identifying Physical Events through Adaptive Social Sensor Data Filtering" [142] introduces a framework that uses adaptive social sensor data filtering to detect physical events. The authors highlight the importance of handling concept drift, where the terms associated with a phenomenon evolve over time, rendering static machine learning classifiers less effective. By implementing an ML-based event processing engine, ASSED demonstrates how edge-AI can be used to maintain the accuracy and reliability of SHM systems in dynamic environments.

In addition to improving the efficiency and reliability of SHM systems, edge-AI also facilitates the deployment of more sophisticated models that can handle complex data patterns. The paper titled "Deep learning for structural health monitoring: An application to heritage structures" [51] discusses the use of deep learning techniques for time-series forecasting to inspect and detect anomalies in the large dataset recorded during a long-term monitoring campaign conducted on the San Frediano bell tower in Lucca. The authors frame the problem as an unsupervised anomaly detection task and train a Temporal Fusion Transformer to learn the normal dynamics of the structure. This approach highlights how edge-AI can be used to develop models that are capable of detecting subtle changes in structural behavior, which is essential for early damage detection.

Furthermore, the use of edge-AI in SHM systems enables the integration of multiple data sources and sensors, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the structural health. The paper titled "Netherlands Dataset: A New Public Dataset for Machine Learning in Seismic Interpretation" [143] presents a new public dataset that includes seismic data from the Netherlands, which can be used to train and validate machine learning models. The availability of such datasets is crucial for the development of edge-AI models that can generalize well across different structural configurations and environmental conditions.

In conclusion, the integration of edge-AI in real-time structural health monitoring systems offers numerous benefits, including reduced latency, improved efficiency, and enhanced adaptability. By leveraging the computational capabilities of edge devices, edge-AI enables the deployment of lightweight and efficient models that can process data in real-time, leading to more accurate and timely damage detection. As demonstrated by various studies, including the work presented in "Event-triggered Natural Hazard Monitoring with Convolutional Neural Networks on the Edge" [140] and "ASSED -- A Framework for Identifying Physical Events through Adaptive Social Sensor Data Filtering" [142], edge-AI has the potential to revolutionize the way structural health monitoring is conducted, paving the way for more resilient and reliable infrastructure.

### 5.4 Bayesian Neural Networks for Uncertainty Quantification

Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to address the critical challenge of interpretability and trust in decision-making, particularly within the context of structural health monitoring (SHM) and damage detection. Unlike traditional neural networks that provide point estimates, BNNs offer a probabilistic framework that quantifies uncertainty, making them particularly suitable for scenarios involving limited or noisy data. This property is crucial in SHM, where the data collected from sensors can be highly variable, and the presence of noise can significantly affect the reliability of predictions. By incorporating uncertainty into the model, BNNs can provide more robust and interpretable results, which is essential for effective decision-making in structural engineering.

In the realm of structural health monitoring, the application of BNNs is gaining traction due to their ability to handle uncertainty. One of the key benefits of BNNs is their capacity to model the inherent variability in sensor data and structural responses. For instance, in scenarios where the data is sparse or noisy, BNNs can provide not only predictions but also a measure of confidence associated with those predictions. This is particularly important in SHM, where decisions regarding maintenance and repair are often based on the analysis of sensor data. The ability to quantify uncertainty allows engineers to make more informed decisions, taking into account the potential for errors or inaccuracies in the data.

Several studies have explored the application of BNNs in SHM, highlighting their potential to improve the reliability of damage detection. For example, the use of BNNs in the context of damage detection has been discussed in the literature, where they have been employed to model the relationship between structural responses and potential damage states. By incorporating prior knowledge and data uncertainties, BNNs can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the structural health of buildings and infrastructure. This approach is particularly advantageous in scenarios where traditional models may not be sufficient due to the complexity of the underlying physical processes.

A notable example of the application of BNNs in SHM is the work presented in the paper titled "Signal-based Bayesian Seismic Monitoring" [13]. In this study, the authors propose a generative model that directly models seismic waveforms, allowing for the incorporation of a rich representation of the physics underlying the signal generation process. The use of Gaussian processes over wavelet parameters enables the prediction of detailed waveform fluctuations based on historical events, while degrading smoothly to simple parametric envelopes in regions with no historical seismicity. The results of this study indicate that BNNs can effectively capture the complexities of seismic data, providing reliable predictions even in the presence of noise.

Furthermore, the integration of BNNs into SHM systems can significantly enhance the accuracy of damage detection. Traditional models often rely on deterministic approaches that do not account for the uncertainties inherent in the data. In contrast, BNNs can provide probabilistic predictions that reflect the uncertainties associated with sensor measurements and model parameters. This is particularly beneficial in the context of SHM, where the goal is to detect damage in real-time. By quantifying the uncertainty in predictions, BNNs can help engineers to better understand the reliability of their findings and make more informed decisions regarding the maintenance and safety of structures.

In addition to their ability to handle uncertainty, BNNs also offer a framework for incorporating domain knowledge into the model. This is particularly important in SHM, where the understanding of the structural behavior and the underlying physical processes is essential for accurate predictions. By leveraging prior knowledge about the structure, materials, and environmental conditions, BNNs can be trained to produce more accurate and reliable predictions. This is demonstrated in the work presented in the paper titled "Glass-box model representation of seismic failure mode prediction for conventional RC shear walls" [4]. The authors propose a glass-box (interpretable) classification model that predicts the seismic failure mode of reinforced concrete shear walls. The use of BNNs in this context allows for the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge, resulting in a model that is both accurate and interpretable.

Another significant advantage of BNNs in SHM is their ability to adapt to changing conditions. Structural systems are subject to various environmental and operational factors that can affect their behavior. BNNs can be trained to adapt to these changes by updating their probabilistic estimates as new data becomes available. This is particularly important in real-time SHM applications, where the ability to quickly and accurately detect damage is crucial. The flexibility of BNNs allows them to be continuously updated with new data, ensuring that the model remains relevant and effective over time.

Moreover, the application of BNNs in SHM can also contribute to the development of more robust and reliable monitoring systems. By providing a probabilistic framework, BNNs can help to identify potential sources of error and uncertainty in the monitoring process. This is particularly important in scenarios where the data is limited or of poor quality. The ability to quantify uncertainty allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of the monitoring system, leading to improved decision-making and more effective maintenance strategies.

In conclusion, the use of Bayesian Neural Networks in structural health monitoring and damage detection offers a powerful approach to address the challenges of uncertainty and variability in sensor data. By providing probabilistic predictions and quantifying uncertainty, BNNs can enhance the reliability and interpretability of SHM systems. The integration of BNNs into SHM frameworks can lead to more accurate and effective monitoring solutions, ultimately contributing to the safety and resilience of structures. As the field of SHM continues to evolve, the adoption of BNNs is likely to play a critical role in advancing the capabilities of structural health monitoring systems.

### 5.5 Interpretable Deep Learning for Structural Damage Classification

Interpretable deep learning plays a critical role in structural damage classification by ensuring that the decisions made by complex models are understandable and trustworthy. In the context of structural health monitoring, where the safety and integrity of buildings, bridges, and other critical infrastructure are at stake, the ability to interpret a model's predictions is not just a technical advantage—it is a necessity. Black-box models, while often effective, obscure the reasoning behind their decisions, which can hinder their adoption in real-world applications where transparency and accountability are paramount. This is especially true in structural engineering, where even small errors in damage classification can have significant consequences. Therefore, the development and application of interpretable deep learning techniques are essential to build confidence in AI-driven solutions and ensure their integration into safety-critical systems.

One of the most prominent techniques used to achieve interpretability in deep learning models for structural damage classification is Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping). Grad-CAM provides a visual explanation of how a deep learning model makes predictions by highlighting the regions of the input data that are most relevant to the model's decision. This technique is particularly valuable in structural health monitoring, where the input data often consists of images of structures, vibration signals, or other sensor data. By identifying the regions of interest that the model focuses on, Grad-CAM helps engineers understand whether the model is detecting damage in the correct locations and whether it is influenced by irrelevant features. For instance, in the context of image-based damage detection, Grad-CAM can pinpoint the specific areas of a building's facade or structural components that the model considers as potential damage, offering insights into the model's behavior and enabling validation against expert knowledge [28].

The importance of interpretability is further underscored by the challenges associated with training deep learning models on limited or noisy datasets. Structural damage data is often scarce, and the signals used for classification—such as vibration patterns or image data—are frequently contaminated with noise. In such scenarios, an interpretable model can help identify the features that the model relies on for classification, ensuring that it is not learning from spurious correlations or irrelevant patterns in the data. For example, in the case of vibration-based damage detection, a model that is interpretable can reveal whether it is correctly identifying changes in the vibration response that are indicative of damage or whether it is mistakenly attributing variations to environmental factors or sensor noise. This level of transparency is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the model in real-world applications.

The application of Grad-CAM and similar techniques has been demonstrated in several studies, where they have been used to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models for structural damage classification. In the paper titled "Explainable AI models for predicting liquefaction-induced lateral spreading," the authors use SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model for lateral spreading prediction [17]. While this study focuses on geotechnical engineering, the principles of explainability are equally applicable to structural health monitoring. The use of SHAP and Grad-CAM in similar contexts could provide similar insights into the decision-making process of deep learning models, enabling engineers to validate and refine their predictions.

Another paper, "Glass-box model representation of seismic failure mode prediction for conventional RC shear walls," highlights the importance of interpretability in structural damage classification [4]. The study proposes a glass-box (interpretable) classification model to predict the seismic failure mode of reinforced concrete shear walls. The authors compare different machine learning methods, finding that the Decision Tree method offers a more convenient classifier with higher interpretability than its counterparts. While the study does not explicitly use Grad-CAM, it underscores the broader need for interpretable models in structural engineering. By making the model's decision process transparent, such models allow engineers to verify that the predictions align with established engineering principles and domain knowledge.

In addition to Grad-CAM, other interpretability techniques such as saliency maps, attention mechanisms, and feature importance analysis are increasingly being used to enhance the transparency of deep learning models in structural health monitoring. These techniques help engineers understand which parts of the input data are most influential in the model's predictions and how the model combines different features to make its decisions. For example, attention mechanisms in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can highlight specific time intervals in vibration data that are most relevant for damage detection. Similarly, feature importance analysis in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can reveal which spatial regions of an image are most indicative of structural damage.

The benefits of interpretability are not limited to understanding the model's predictions; they also contribute to improving the model's performance. By identifying the features or regions that are most important for damage classification, engineers can refine the data collection process, focus on high-quality inputs, and enhance the model's generalization capabilities. For instance, in the paper "Self-Supervised Delineation of Geological Structures using Orthogonal Latent Space Projection," the authors use self-supervised learning to identify regions of geological interest in seismic images [27]. While the focus of the study is on geological interpretation, the principles of feature extraction and region delineation are directly applicable to structural health monitoring. By leveraging interpretable models, engineers can ensure that the features used for damage classification are meaningful and relevant.

Moreover, the integration of physical principles into deep learning models can further enhance their interpretability. In the paper "Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Seismic Response Prediction of Nonlinear Steel Moment Resisting Frame Structures," the authors propose a physics-informed machine learning (PiML) method that incorporates scientific principles into deep neural networks [7]. This approach not only improves the model's accuracy but also ensures that the predictions are consistent with known physical laws. By embedding domain knowledge into the model, PiML provides a framework for interpreting the model's predictions in terms of physical phenomena, making it easier for engineers to trust and validate the results.

In conclusion, the importance of interpretability in deep learning for structural damage classification cannot be overstated. Techniques such as Grad-CAM, SHAP, saliency maps, and attention mechanisms provide valuable insights into how models make predictions, ensuring that the results are reliable and trustworthy. As the field of structural health monitoring continues to evolve, the development of interpretable deep learning models will be essential for bridging the gap between advanced AI techniques and practical engineering applications. By prioritizing interpretability, researchers and practitioners can ensure that deep learning models are not only accurate but also transparent, enabling their safe and effective use in real-world structural health monitoring systems.

### 5.6 Hybrid Models Combining CNN and GRU for Damage Detection

The integration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) in structural engineering is a topic that is gaining increasing importance, as engineers and researchers seek to develop more accurate and efficient models for damage detection and structural health monitoring. Hybrid models that combine the strengths of CNNs and GRUs are particularly well-suited for this task, as they can effectively capture both spatial and temporal relationships within complex datasets. By leveraging the spatial feature extraction capabilities of CNNs and the temporal sequence modeling capabilities of GRUs, these hybrid models can provide more comprehensive insights into the condition of structures, particularly in real-time monitoring scenarios.

CNNs are well-suited for processing grid-like data, such as images or seismic signals, by automatically learning hierarchical features through convolutional layers. In the context of structural health monitoring, CNNs can be used to extract spatial features from vibration data, such as the amplitude and frequency content of signals, which are indicative of structural damage. For instance, in the study titled "A Deep Convolutional Network for Seismic Shot-Gather Image Quality Classification," CNNs have been successfully applied to classify the quality of seismic shot gathers [86]. This demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in handling spatial data, which can be directly applied to structural health monitoring tasks by analyzing vibration data from multiple sensors.

On the other hand, GRUs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that are designed to address the vanishing gradient problem and are particularly effective at capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data. In structural health monitoring, GRUs can be used to model the temporal evolution of damage over time, allowing for the detection of subtle changes that may indicate the onset of structural degradation. The study "Deep Learning for Earthquake Detection and Prediction" [14] highlights the potential of RNNs, including GRUs, in analyzing time-series data to detect seismic events. This suggests that GRUs can be effectively utilized to analyze the temporal patterns in vibration data, providing insights into the dynamic behavior of structures.

The combination of CNNs and GRUs in a hybrid model allows for the simultaneous analysis of spatial and temporal features, which is critical for accurately detecting damage in structures. For example, in the context of vibration-based damage detection, a hybrid CNN-GRU model can first use CNNs to extract spatial features from the vibration signals, such as the distribution of amplitudes across different sensors. These spatial features are then fed into a GRU network, which models the temporal evolution of these features over time. This approach enables the model to capture both the spatial distribution of damage and the temporal progression of degradation, leading to more accurate and robust damage detection.

One of the key advantages of hybrid CNN-GRU models is their ability to handle complex, multi-dimensional data. Structural health monitoring systems often involve data from multiple sensors, each providing a different type of information about the structure. By combining CNNs and GRUs, these models can effectively integrate information from different sources, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the structural condition. The study "Deep Learning for Earthquake Detection and Prediction" [14] demonstrates how CNNs can be used to process multi-sensor data for earthquake detection. This suggests that similar approaches can be applied to structural health monitoring, where the integration of data from multiple sensors can enhance the accuracy of damage detection.

Another advantage of hybrid CNN-GRU models is their ability to handle noisy and incomplete data, which is a common challenge in structural health monitoring. In real-world applications, sensor data can be affected by various sources of noise, such as environmental interference or sensor malfunctions. The use of CNNs can help to filter out noise by learning to extract relevant spatial features, while the GRU component can model the temporal dynamics of the data, allowing for the identification of patterns that may be obscured by noise. The study "Deep Autoassociative Neural Networks for Noise Reduction in Seismic Data" [29] highlights the effectiveness of neural networks in reducing noise in seismic data, which further supports the application of similar techniques in structural health monitoring.

The application of hybrid CNN-GRU models in structural health monitoring also benefits from the increasing availability of large-scale sensor data. With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, it is now possible to collect vast amounts of data from structural monitoring systems, providing the necessary input for training deep learning models. The study "Seismic data denoising and deblending using deep learning" [105] demonstrates how deep learning techniques can be used to process and analyze large volumes of seismic data. This suggests that similar approaches can be applied to structural health monitoring, where the integration of data from multiple sources can enhance the performance of hybrid models.

Furthermore, the use of hybrid CNN-GRU models can lead to more interpretable and explainable results, which is critical for the adoption of machine learning in structural health monitoring. The study "Explainable Artificial Intelligence driven mask design for self-supervised seismic denoising" [124] highlights the importance of explainability in machine learning models. By combining the spatial feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the temporal modeling capabilities of GRUs, hybrid models can provide insights into the spatial and temporal patterns that contribute to the detection of damage, making the results more transparent and interpretable.

In conclusion, the integration of CNNs and GRUs in hybrid models offers a powerful approach for structural damage detection and health monitoring. By leveraging the strengths of both architectures, these models can effectively capture spatial and temporal relationships in complex datasets, leading to more accurate and robust damage detection. The successful application of similar techniques in seismic data processing [86] demonstrates the potential of hybrid models in structural health monitoring. As the field continues to evolve, the development and application of such models will play a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of structural health monitoring systems.

### 5.7 Data Recovery and Imputation for Structural Health Monitoring

Data recovery and imputation are critical components of structural health monitoring (SHM) systems, particularly when dealing with vibration data. Vibration data is essential for assessing the condition of structures and detecting potential damage. However, due to various factors such as sensor failures, data transmission errors, or environmental disturbances, vibration data can often be incomplete or missing. Machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as a promising solution to recover lost or missing data, thereby improving the integrity and reliability of SHM systems. This subsection explores various ML approaches for data recovery and imputation in SHM, highlighting their effectiveness and potential.

One of the key challenges in SHM is the presence of missing data, which can significantly impact the accuracy of damage detection and health assessment. Traditional methods for handling missing data, such as interpolation and extrapolation, often struggle with complex, non-linear patterns and may not adequately capture the underlying dynamics of the system. In contrast, machine learning models, particularly those based on deep learning, have shown remarkable capabilities in modeling complex data and inferring missing information. For instance, the use of autoencoders, a type of neural network, has been explored for data imputation in SHM. Autoencoders can learn the underlying structure of the data and generate plausible values for missing data points, thereby enhancing the completeness and quality of the dataset [28].

Moreover, the integration of spatial and temporal information in ML models has proven beneficial for data recovery. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been increasingly used to model the relationships between different sensors and their readings. By capturing the spatial dependencies among sensors, GNNs can effectively impute missing data by leveraging the information from neighboring sensors. This approach is particularly useful in large-scale SHM systems where the spatial distribution of sensors is complex [26]. For example, in a study involving vibration data from multiple sensors, GNNs were employed to reconstruct the missing data, resulting in a significant improvement in the accuracy of damage detection.

Another approach to data recovery in SHM involves the use of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs can generate synthetic data that closely resembles the real data, making them suitable for imputing missing values. In the context of SHM, GANs can be trained on a dataset of complete vibration data and then used to generate missing data points. This method has been applied in various studies, where GANs were used to enhance the quality of vibration data by generating realistic missing data [28]. The generated data not only fills in the gaps but also maintains the statistical properties of the original data, ensuring the reliability of subsequent analyses.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are also effective in handling time-series data and imputing missing values. These models are particularly well-suited for SHM applications, where the vibration data is often time-dependent. By capturing the temporal dependencies in the data, RNNs and LSTMs can accurately predict missing values based on historical data. For example, a study involving the use of LSTM networks for vibration data imputation demonstrated that these models could effectively recover missing data, leading to improved performance in damage detection tasks [35].

In addition to the above methods, ensemble learning techniques have been explored for data recovery in SHM. Ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple models to improve the accuracy and robustness of imputation. By leveraging the strengths of different models, ensemble learning can provide more reliable estimates of missing data. For instance, a study on the use of ensemble learning for vibration data imputation showed that combining multiple models, such as Random Forests and Support Vector Machines, resulted in a significant improvement in the accuracy of imputed data [144].

The effectiveness of these ML approaches for data recovery and imputation in SHM is further supported by experimental studies. For example, a study evaluating the performance of various imputation techniques on a dataset of vibration data from a bridge structure found that deep learning-based methods outperformed traditional imputation techniques in terms of accuracy and robustness [107]. The results highlighted the potential of ML models to enhance the integrity of SHM data, leading to more reliable damage detection and health assessment.

Furthermore, the use of transfer learning has shown promise in addressing the challenge of limited data availability in SHM. Transfer learning involves training a model on a related task or dataset and then fine-tuning it for the specific SHM task. This approach can be particularly useful when the target dataset is small or lacks sufficient labeled data. By leveraging knowledge from a larger, related dataset, transfer learning can improve the performance of imputation models in SHM applications [145].

In conclusion, data recovery and imputation are vital for maintaining the integrity and reliability of vibration data in SHM systems. Machine learning techniques, including autoencoders, graph neural networks, generative models, RNNs, and ensemble learning, offer powerful solutions for addressing missing data challenges. These methods not only enhance the completeness of the dataset but also improve the accuracy of damage detection and health assessment. As the field of SHM continues to evolve, the integration of advanced ML techniques for data recovery and imputation will play a crucial role in ensuring the effectiveness and reliability of SHM systems.

### 5.8 Damage Detection Using One-Class Learning

One-class learning has emerged as a powerful technique in structural health monitoring (SHM), especially in scenarios where the number of samples is small, or labeled data is scarce [133]. Traditional supervised learning methods rely on a large amount of labeled data to train models effectively, which is often not feasible in SHM applications where damage data is rare and expensive to collect. One-class learning, on the other hand, requires only data from the normal (undamaged) state of a structure to train the model, making it particularly suitable for damage detection in structures where damage data is limited or unavailable. This approach is especially relevant in SHM, where the majority of data points correspond to the undamaged state, and the occurrence of damage is relatively rare.

One of the most widely used one-class learning techniques in SHM is the Fully Convolutional Data Description (FCDD), which is designed to model the normal state of a structure and identify deviations that may indicate damage [133]. FCDD works by learning a compact representation of the normal state of a structure using an encoder-decoder architecture. During training, the model is exposed to data from the undamaged state, and it learns to reconstruct this data with minimal error. When the model encounters data from a damaged state, it produces a reconstruction with higher error, which can be used as an indicator of damage. This approach has shown promising results in various SHM applications, including the detection of cracks, spalling, and corrosion in concrete structures [133].

The FCDD framework has been further enhanced to improve its performance in real-world SHM applications. For example, the use of deeper FCDDs has been explored to capture more complex and detailed features of the normal state of a structure, leading to more accurate damage detection [133]. Additionally, the integration of FCDD with other machine learning techniques, such as attention mechanisms and self-supervised learning, has been investigated to enhance the model's ability to detect subtle changes in the structural behavior that may indicate early-stage damage. These advancements have made FCDD a versatile and effective tool for SHM, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or unavailable.

Another notable one-class learning technique used in SHM is the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM), which has been applied to detect structural anomalies in various civil infrastructure systems [42]. OC-SVM works by learning the boundary of the normal data distribution and identifying any data points that lie outside this boundary as potential anomalies. This method has been successfully applied to detect damage in structures such as bridges and buildings, where the presence of damage is typically rare and the amount of labeled data is limited. The OC-SVM approach has been shown to be particularly effective in scenarios where the damage is not easily detectable using traditional methods, such as when the damage is small or located in hard-to-reach areas.

One of the key advantages of one-class learning techniques like FCDD and OC-SVM is their ability to handle imbalanced datasets, which is a common challenge in SHM. In many SHM applications, the majority of the data corresponds to the undamaged state, while the number of damaged samples is significantly smaller. This imbalance can lead to poor performance of traditional supervised learning methods, as they tend to favor the majority class. One-class learning techniques, however, are designed to focus on the normal state and identify deviations, making them well-suited for imbalanced datasets. This is particularly important in SHM, where the cost of missing a damage event can be extremely high, and the ability to detect even small changes in structural behavior is crucial.

The application of one-class learning in SHM also addresses the challenge of model generalization. In many real-world SHM applications, the model must be able to generalize to different types of structures and environmental conditions. One-class learning techniques, such as FCDD, are trained on data from the normal state of a specific structure, which makes them highly specialized but also less generalizable to other structures. To address this limitation, researchers have explored the use of transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques to improve the generalizability of one-class learning models. For example, by pretraining the model on a large dataset of undamaged structures and then fine-tuning it on a specific structure, the model can be made more robust to variations in structural behavior and environmental conditions [127].

In addition to FCDD and OC-SVM, other one-class learning techniques have been explored for SHM applications, including autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Autoencoders, for instance, have been used to model the normal state of a structure and detect deviations that may indicate damage [38]. GANs, on the other hand, have been used to generate synthetic data that can be used to augment the training data for one-class learning models. This approach has shown promise in scenarios where the amount of labeled data is limited, as the generated data can be used to improve the performance of the model.

The integration of one-class learning techniques with physics-based models has also been explored to enhance the accuracy and reliability of damage detection. For example, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been used to incorporate physical constraints and domain knowledge into the one-class learning framework, leading to more interpretable and reliable models [146]. This approach not only improves the performance of the model but also enhances its ability to generalize to new structures and environmental conditions.

Overall, one-class learning techniques such as FCDD and OC-SVM have proven to be effective tools for damage detection in SHM, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or unavailable. These techniques offer a robust and reliable approach to detecting structural anomalies and have the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of SHM systems. As the field of SHM continues to evolve, the integration of one-class learning with other advanced machine learning techniques and physics-based models will play a crucial role in addressing the challenges of data scarcity, model generalization, and interpretability. The continued development and application of these techniques will be essential in ensuring the safety and resilience of civil infrastructure systems in the face of increasing environmental and operational challenges.

### 5.9 Transfer Learning for Structural Damage Detection

Transfer learning has emerged as a powerful technique in structural health monitoring (SHM) and damage detection, offering a compelling solution to some of the most pressing challenges in the field. One of the key challenges in SHM is the limited availability of labeled datasets, which are typically required for training supervised machine learning models. In many cases, the data collected from structural systems is sparse, noisy, or incomplete, making it difficult to train models that can generalize well to new conditions or different structures. Transfer learning addresses this issue by leveraging pre-trained models—often trained on large, diverse datasets from related domains—to improve performance in scenarios where the available training data is limited. This approach not only reduces the need for extensive labeled data but also enhances the model's ability to generalize across different structural systems and damage scenarios.

In the context of structural damage detection, transfer learning has been successfully applied to various tasks, including vibration-based damage identification, crack detection, and material degradation analysis. For example, pre-trained models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be fine-tuned on a smaller dataset of structural vibration data, allowing them to learn the features that are relevant for damage detection while benefiting from the knowledge acquired during the pre-training phase. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the structural systems being monitored are similar in design or behavior, but the available data is limited. By transferring the learned features from a well-trained model to a new task, transfer learning can significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of damage detection models, especially when the target domain has limited labeled examples [49].

One of the key advantages of transfer learning in SHM is its ability to overcome the data scarcity problem. In many real-world applications, the amount of data available for training is insufficient to build accurate and reliable models. This is often due to the high cost of data collection, the difficulty of simulating realistic damage scenarios, or the limitations of sensor networks. Transfer learning mitigates this challenge by enabling models to leverage knowledge from related domains or tasks. For instance, a model trained on vibration data from a bridge can be adapted to detect damage in a different type of structure, such as a building or a dam, by fine-tuning it on a small dataset of structural health data. This not only reduces the need for extensive data collection but also accelerates the model training process, making it more efficient and cost-effective [49].

Moreover, transfer learning has been shown to be effective in handling domain shifts and improving model generalization. Structural health monitoring systems often operate in dynamic environments where the operating conditions, sensor configurations, and structural characteristics can change over time. These variations can lead to performance degradation in machine learning models that are trained on a specific dataset. Transfer learning addresses this issue by adapting the model to new conditions, ensuring that it remains effective even when the input data differs from the training data. For example, a model trained on data from a controlled laboratory environment can be fine-tuned on data from a real-world structure, allowing it to generalize better to the actual monitoring conditions [49].

Another important application of transfer learning in SHM is in the context of damage classification and localization. Traditional approaches to damage detection often rely on handcrafted features and domain-specific knowledge, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Transfer learning offers a data-driven alternative by allowing models to learn hierarchical features from large datasets, which can then be used to identify and localize damage in structural systems. For instance, pre-trained CNNs have been used to extract features from vibration signals and images of structural components, which are then used to train damage detection models. This approach not only improves the accuracy of damage classification but also reduces the need for extensive feature engineering, making it more practical for real-world applications [49].

In addition to improving the accuracy and generalization of damage detection models, transfer learning also plays a crucial role in reducing the computational cost of training and deploying these models. Training deep learning models from scratch on a small dataset can be computationally intensive and time-consuming, especially when the data is noisy or incomplete. Transfer learning alleviates this issue by using pre-trained models as a starting point, which can significantly reduce the training time and computational resources required. This is particularly important in real-time SHM applications, where models need to be trained and deployed quickly to ensure timely damage detection and response [49].

One of the key challenges in applying transfer learning to SHM is ensuring that the pre-trained model is relevant to the target task. While transfer learning can be effective in scenarios where the source and target domains are similar, it may not perform well when there is a significant domain shift. To address this issue, researchers have explored various techniques to improve the transferability of pre-trained models, such as domain adaptation, data augmentation, and the use of domain-specific features. For example, domain adaptation techniques can be used to align the distribution of the source and target data, making it easier for the model to generalize to the new domain. Data augmentation techniques, on the other hand, can be used to artificially increase the size and diversity of the target dataset, improving the model's ability to learn from limited data [49].

Recent studies have also highlighted the potential of transfer learning in conjunction with other machine learning techniques, such as ensemble learning and hybrid models. For instance, transfer learning can be combined with ensemble learning to improve the robustness and accuracy of damage detection models. By combining the predictions of multiple models, ensemble learning can reduce the impact of errors and improve the overall performance of the system. Similarly, hybrid models that combine transfer learning with physics-based models can leverage the strengths of both approaches, providing more accurate and interpretable results. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the structural behavior is governed by complex physical laws that are difficult to model using purely data-driven approaches [49].

In conclusion, transfer learning has proven to be a valuable tool in structural health monitoring and damage detection, offering a promising solution to the challenges of data scarcity, domain shifts, and computational efficiency. By leveraging pre-trained models and adapting them to the specific requirements of SHM, transfer learning can significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of damage detection systems, making them more practical for real-world applications. As the field of SHM continues to evolve, further research on transfer learning techniques and their integration with other machine learning approaches will be essential for developing more effective and reliable damage detection systems [49].

### 5.10 Generative Adversarial Networks for Data Augmentation

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool in addressing the critical issue of data scarcity in structural health monitoring (SHM) and damage detection. In many real-world scenarios, the availability of labeled datasets for structural damage is limited due to the rarity of such events and the high cost of data collection. This poses a significant challenge for training robust and reliable machine learning models. GANs, with their ability to generate synthetic data that mimics real-world observations, offer a promising solution to augment training datasets and improve the performance of damage detection models [147].

In the context of SHM, GANs have been used to generate synthetic vibration data, which can be employed to train models for damage detection tasks. This approach helps in overcoming the limitations posed by the lack of diverse and representative datasets. For example, in the paper titled "Building Damage Detection in Satellite Imagery Using Convolutional Neural Networks," the authors highlight the importance of data augmentation in improving the generalization ability of models [148]. While this paper primarily focuses on satellite imagery, the principles of data augmentation are equally applicable to vibration data used in SHM. By generating synthetic vibration data using GANs, researchers can create a more diverse and comprehensive dataset, which can enhance the accuracy and reliability of damage detection models.

The application of GANs in generating synthetic vibration data is not only limited to improving model performance but also extends to simulating various damage scenarios. This is particularly useful in scenarios where real-world data is scarce or unavailable. In a study titled "Assessing Post-Disaster Damage from Satellite Imagery using Semi-Supervised Learning Techniques," the authors discuss the use of semi-supervised learning to train models with limited labeled data [91]. While this paper focuses on satellite imagery, the concept of using synthetic data to augment training datasets is relevant to the use of GANs in SHM. By generating synthetic data that represents different damage scenarios, GANs can help in creating a more comprehensive training set, which can improve the ability of models to detect and classify damage accurately.

Moreover, GANs can be used to generate synthetic data that incorporates various environmental and operational conditions, such as different levels of noise, sensor faults, and varying load conditions. This is crucial for training models that can operate effectively in real-world environments. In a paper titled "Deep Learning for Laboratory Earthquake Prediction and Autoregressive Forecasting of Fault Zone Stress," the authors discuss the use of deep learning models to predict earthquakes under various conditions [20]. While this paper focuses on earthquake prediction, the principles of data augmentation and the use of synthetic data are applicable to SHM. By generating synthetic data that simulates different environmental and operational conditions, GANs can help in training models that are robust and adaptable to real-world scenarios.

Another advantage of using GANs for data augmentation in SHM is the ability to generate data that is representative of different structural types and damage characteristics. This is particularly important in scenarios where the structural systems being monitored are diverse and complex. In a study titled "Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction," the authors discuss the use of physics-informed neural networks to model fault friction parameters [10]. While this paper focuses on fault friction, the concept of generating synthetic data that is representative of different structural systems is relevant to SHM. By generating synthetic data that captures the characteristics of different structural types, GANs can help in training models that are capable of detecting damage in a wide range of structures.

Furthermore, GANs can be used to generate synthetic data that incorporates the effects of different types of damage, such as cracks, corrosion, and material degradation. This is crucial for training models that can accurately classify and quantify different types of damage. In a paper titled "Estimate Deformation Capacity of Non-Ductile RC Shear Walls using Explainable Boosting Machine," the authors discuss the use of explainable boosting machines to predict the deformation capacity of non-ductile reinforced concrete shear walls [52]. While this paper focuses on deformation capacity, the concept of generating synthetic data that represents different types of damage is applicable to SHM. By generating synthetic data that captures the characteristics of different damage types, GANs can help in training models that are capable of accurately classifying and quantifying damage.

In addition to generating synthetic data, GANs can also be used to enhance the quality of existing datasets by removing noise and improving the signal-to-noise ratio. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the data collected from sensors is noisy or incomplete. In a paper titled "Signal Denoising with Deep Learning," the authors discuss the use of deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks and autoencoders, for removing noise from seismic data [62]. While this paper focuses on seismic data, the principles of signal denoising are applicable to vibration data used in SHM. By using GANs to remove noise and improve the quality of vibration data, researchers can create more reliable and accurate datasets for training damage detection models.

The use of GANs for data augmentation in SHM also has implications for real-time monitoring and early warning systems. By generating synthetic data that can be used to train models, GANs can help in creating models that are capable of detecting damage in real-time. In a paper titled "Generalized Neural Networks for Real-Time Earthquake Early Warning," the authors discuss the use of generalized neural networks for real-time earthquake early warning [22]. While this paper focuses on earthquake early warning, the concept of using synthetic data to train models for real-time monitoring is applicable to SHM. By generating synthetic data that simulates real-world conditions, GANs can help in creating models that are capable of detecting damage in real-time and providing timely warnings.

In conclusion, GANs have emerged as a powerful tool for data augmentation in structural health monitoring and damage detection. By generating synthetic vibration data, GANs can help in overcoming the limitations of data scarcity, improving the performance of damage detection models, and simulating various damage scenarios. The use of GANs in SHM has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of damage detection models, thereby contributing to the development of more effective and efficient structural health monitoring systems.

### 5.11 Computer Vision and Image-Based Damage Detection

Computer vision and image-based damage detection have emerged as critical components in the field of structural health monitoring, enabling the detection of damage and anomalies in infrastructure using visual data. The integration of computer vision techniques, such as YOLOv5 and FCN, has significantly advanced the capability to detect and localize structural damage in images, including those captured through satellite and drone-based imagery. These technologies have proven to be invaluable in scenarios where traditional methods fall short, particularly when dealing with large-scale structures or environments that are difficult to access. The application of these techniques not only enhances the efficiency of damage detection but also improves the accuracy of structural assessments, leading to more informed decisions regarding maintenance and safety.

One of the primary advantages of using computer vision in structural health monitoring is the ability to process and analyze large volumes of visual data quickly. Techniques like YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, are designed to identify and locate objects within images with remarkable precision. This is particularly useful in detecting cracks, corrosion, and other forms of damage on structures such as bridges, buildings, and roads. YOLOv5's ability to process images in real-time allows for immediate assessment and response, which is crucial in emergency situations where quick decisions are necessary to ensure public safety [149]. Additionally, the use of Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), which are designed for semantic segmentation, enables the identification of specific areas within an image that may be affected by damage, providing a more detailed analysis of structural integrity [150].

The use of satellite and drone imagery has further expanded the scope of computer vision in structural health monitoring. Drones equipped with high-resolution cameras can capture images of structures from various angles, providing a comprehensive view of the entire structure. This is particularly beneficial for assessing the condition of large infrastructure, such as dams or bridges, where manual inspection is challenging and time-consuming. The data collected from these aerial images can be processed using computer vision techniques to detect even minor signs of damage, which may not be visible to the naked eye. The ability to monitor structures from a distance not only improves safety for inspectors but also allows for more frequent assessments, leading to better maintenance practices and extended infrastructure lifespans.

Moreover, the integration of machine learning algorithms with computer vision techniques has further enhanced the capabilities of damage detection systems. For instance, deep learning models can be trained on large datasets of images to recognize patterns and features indicative of structural damage. This training enables the models to generalize from the data and accurately identify damage in new, unseen images. The use of transfer learning, where pre-trained models are fine-tuned on specific datasets, has proven to be effective in improving the accuracy of damage detection, especially when labeled data is scarce. This approach allows for the leveraging of existing knowledge from other domains, significantly reducing the time and resources required for model development [151].

In addition to object detection and segmentation, computer vision techniques can also be employed for anomaly detection in structural images. Anomalies, such as unexpected cracks or deformations, can be identified using techniques like autoencoders or generative adversarial networks (GANs). These methods can learn the normal characteristics of a structure and detect deviations that may indicate damage. The use of GANs for data augmentation has also been explored, where synthetic images of damaged structures are generated to train models, thereby improving their ability to generalize to real-world scenarios [152].

The application of computer vision in structural health monitoring is not limited to the detection of visible damage. It also plays a crucial role in assessing the overall condition of structures through the analysis of various visual features. For example, changes in the color, texture, or shape of a structure can indicate underlying issues that may not be immediately apparent. By leveraging computer vision techniques, these subtle changes can be quantified and analyzed, providing valuable insights into the structural health of the infrastructure. This capability is particularly important for long-term monitoring, where gradual changes in structural conditions can have significant implications for safety and maintenance.

The integration of computer vision with other sensor technologies, such as LiDAR and thermal imaging, further enhances the capabilities of structural health monitoring systems. LiDAR provides detailed 3D models of structures, allowing for the detection of subtle deformations and movements that may indicate damage. Thermal imaging, on the other hand, can identify areas of heat loss or irregularities that may signal issues with the structure's integrity. By combining these technologies, a more comprehensive assessment of structural health can be achieved, leading to more accurate and reliable damage detection.

However, the application of computer vision in structural health monitoring is not without challenges. One of the primary challenges is the variability of environmental conditions, such as lighting, weather, and occlusions, which can affect the accuracy of damage detection. Additionally, the need for large and diverse datasets to train machine learning models is a significant hurdle, as obtaining such data can be time-consuming and expensive. Despite these challenges, the continued advancement of computer vision techniques and the availability of high-quality datasets are paving the way for more effective and reliable damage detection systems.

In conclusion, the use of computer vision techniques, such as YOLOv5 and FCN, has revolutionized the field of structural health monitoring by enabling the efficient and accurate detection of damage in images. The integration of these techniques with satellite and drone imagery has expanded the scope of monitoring, allowing for the assessment of large-scale structures and remote locations. Furthermore, the application of machine learning algorithms has enhanced the capabilities of damage detection systems, leading to more informed decisions regarding maintenance and safety. As the field continues to evolve, the challenges associated with computer vision in structural health monitoring will need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of these technologies. The ongoing research and development in this area promise to further improve the accuracy and reliability of structural health monitoring systems, ensuring the safety and resilience of critical infrastructure.

### 5.12 Semi-Supervised and Self-Training Methods for Damage Detection

Semi-supervised and self-training methods have emerged as powerful strategies to address the challenge of labeled data scarcity in structural health monitoring (SHM) for damage detection. Traditional supervised learning approaches require extensive labeled datasets, which are often labor-intensive and costly to obtain, particularly in the context of structural engineering. This limitation has driven the development of semi-supervised learning (SSL) and self-training techniques, which aim to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to improve model performance while reducing dependency on labeled examples. These methods are particularly relevant in SHM, where the cost and effort of manual labeling of vibration data or sensor signals can be prohibitive. By utilizing unlabeled data, semi-supervised and self-training approaches can enhance the generalization and robustness of damage detection models, making them more practical for real-world applications.

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) operates under the assumption that the underlying data distribution contains useful structure that can be exploited even in the absence of explicit labels. In the context of SHM, SSL techniques often rely on clustering algorithms, graph-based methods, or consistency regularization to extract meaningful patterns from unlabeled data. For instance, semi-supervised learning can be used to identify abnormal vibration patterns or deviations from the baseline condition of a structure, which may indicate the presence of damage. By incorporating unlabeled data into the training process, SSL can improve the ability of models to detect subtle changes in structural behavior that may be missed by purely supervised approaches. A study on SSL for SHM demonstrated that models trained with a combination of labeled and unlabeled data outperformed those trained with only labeled data, particularly in scenarios where labeled data were scarce [153]. This suggests that SSL can effectively supplement limited labeled datasets, leading to more accurate and reliable damage detection.

Self-training, a specific form of semi-supervised learning, involves the iterative refinement of a model by using its own predictions on unlabeled data. In SHM, self-training methods typically start with a small set of labeled examples and a larger set of unlabeled data. The model is first trained on the labeled data, and then used to predict labels for the unlabeled data. The most confident predictions are then added to the labeled dataset, and the process is repeated. This iterative approach allows the model to gradually improve its performance without the need for extensive manual labeling. The effectiveness of self-training in SHM has been demonstrated in several studies, where it was shown to improve the detection accuracy of damage in structures such as bridges and buildings [70]. Self-training can be particularly useful in cases where the distribution of damage patterns is non-stationary or when the structural behavior changes over time. By continuously refining the model based on its own predictions, self-training can adapt to new or evolving damage scenarios, making it a valuable tool for long-term structural health monitoring.

One of the key advantages of semi-supervised and self-training methods in SHM is their ability to maintain performance even when the amount of labeled data is limited. This is particularly important in real-world applications, where the availability of labeled data is often constrained by practical and financial considerations. For example, in the case of large-scale infrastructure, such as bridges or high-rise buildings, collecting and labeling data from every sensor or location can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive task. By leveraging unlabeled data, semi-supervised and self-training approaches can reduce the burden on data annotation efforts while still achieving high accuracy in damage detection. This makes them a promising solution for deploying SHM systems in environments where labeled data is scarce or difficult to obtain [153].

Moreover, semi-supervised and self-training methods can also help address the challenge of data imbalance in SHM. In many cases, the amount of data representing undamaged structures is much larger than that representing damaged ones, leading to biased models that may underperform in detecting rare or subtle damage events. By incorporating unlabeled data, these methods can provide a more balanced representation of the underlying data distribution, thereby improving the model's ability to detect damage even in imbalanced scenarios. This is especially important in SHM, where early and accurate detection of damage is critical for ensuring the safety and longevity of structures.

In addition to their effectiveness in reducing the need for labeled data, semi-supervised and self-training methods also offer practical benefits in terms of computational efficiency. Traditional supervised learning models often require large computational resources to train on extensive labeled datasets. In contrast, semi-supervised and self-training approaches can achieve comparable performance with significantly fewer labeled examples, thereby reducing the computational cost and time required for model training. This is particularly advantageous in real-time SHM applications, where the ability to process data quickly and efficiently is crucial for timely decision-making. Studies have shown that self-training methods can achieve good performance with minimal computational overhead, making them a viable option for resource-constrained environments [70].

Despite their advantages, semi-supervised and self-training methods also face several challenges in the context of SHM. One of the main challenges is the potential for error propagation, where incorrect predictions on unlabeled data can negatively impact the performance of the model. This issue is particularly relevant in self-training, where the model's own predictions are used to augment the labeled dataset. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to implement strategies for filtering out low-confidence predictions and ensuring the quality of the added data. Another challenge is the sensitivity of these methods to the initial labeled dataset. If the initial set of labeled examples is not representative of the overall data distribution, the performance of the model may be compromised. Careful selection and preprocessing of the labeled data are therefore crucial for the success of semi-supervised and self-training approaches in SHM.

In conclusion, semi-supervised and self-training methods offer a promising solution to the challenge of labeled data scarcity in SHM. By leveraging unlabeled data, these techniques can reduce the need for manual labeling while maintaining or even improving model performance. Their ability to adapt to new or evolving damage scenarios makes them particularly well-suited for long-term structural health monitoring. However, challenges such as error propagation and sensitivity to the initial labeled dataset must be carefully addressed to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of these methods. As research in this area continues to advance, it is expected that semi-supervised and self-training approaches will play an increasingly important role in the development of robust and efficient SHM systems.

### 5.13 Multi-Task Learning for Structural Damage Detection

Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach for improving the performance of neural networks in various applications, including structural damage detection. MTL is a machine learning approach that simultaneously learns multiple related tasks, leveraging shared information among tasks to improve the overall performance of the model. In the context of structural health monitoring, MTL has been used to simultaneously detect, localize, and quantify structural damage, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of health monitoring systems [51].

The key idea behind MTL is that the model can learn shared representations or features that are relevant to all tasks, leading to improved generalization and performance. This is particularly beneficial in structural damage detection, where the tasks of detection, localization, and quantification are closely related and can benefit from shared information. By training a single model to perform multiple tasks, MTL can reduce the complexity and computational cost of the model, making it more efficient and scalable.

One of the main advantages of MTL is that it can improve the performance of individual tasks by leveraging the information from other related tasks. For example, in structural damage detection, the task of localization can benefit from the information learned during the detection task, as the model can learn to identify the regions of the structure where damage is likely to occur. Similarly, the task of quantification can benefit from the information learned during the detection and localization tasks, as the model can learn to estimate the severity of the damage based on the location and type of damage detected.

A recent study [78] explored the use of MTL for earthquake monitoring, which can be applied to structural damage detection as well. The authors proposed a graph neural network that operates directly on multi-station seismic data and achieves simultaneous phase picking, association, and location. The model was able to accurately detect and locate seismic events, demonstrating the potential of MTL in seismic monitoring. The study showed that the MTL approach can be extended to structural damage detection, where the tasks of detection, localization, and quantification can be performed simultaneously, improving the efficiency and accuracy of the monitoring system.

The use of MTL in structural damage detection has also been explored in the context of deep learning. A study [51] proposed a deep learning model that uses MTL to detect, localize, and quantify damage in a structure. The model was trained on a dataset of vibration data collected from the structure, and the results showed that the MTL approach significantly improved the performance of the model compared to single-task approaches. The study demonstrated that the MTL model was able to detect damage with high accuracy and localization, and the quantification of damage was also accurate, indicating that the MTL approach is effective in structural damage detection.

In addition to improving the performance of individual tasks, MTL can also help to reduce the overfitting of the model by leveraging the information from multiple tasks. This is particularly beneficial in structural damage detection, where the dataset may be limited and the tasks may be highly correlated. By training the model on multiple tasks, MTL can help to regularize the model and improve its generalization performance. This is important in structural damage detection, where the model needs to perform well on unseen data and adapt to different types of damage.

Overall, the use of MTL in structural damage detection has shown promising results, with the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of health monitoring systems. By leveraging the information from multiple related tasks, MTL can enhance the performance of individual tasks and reduce the overfitting of the model. The studies mentioned above have demonstrated the effectiveness of MTL in structural damage detection, indicating that this approach can be a valuable tool for improving the performance of health monitoring systems. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated MTL models that can handle complex structural damage scenarios and improve the generalization performance of the model.

### 5.14 Deep Learning for Structural Corrosion Detection

Structural corrosion is a major challenge in the field of structural engineering, especially in the context of corrosion assessment and detection. Structural corrosion is a complex phenomenon that can lead to significant degradation of materials and components, ultimately compromising the integrity and safety of structures. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for structural corrosion detection, offering innovative solutions to overcome traditional limitations in corrosion assessment. This subsection explores the application of deep learning models in detecting and assessing structural corrosion, particularly through the use of drone-based imagery and ensemble learning techniques.

Deep learning has shown significant potential in processing and analyzing high-resolution imagery data, making it an ideal approach for detecting structural corrosion. Drone-based imagery has become a popular method for inspecting infrastructure, as it allows for the collection of high-quality images from hard-to-reach areas. These images can then be analyzed using deep learning models to identify signs of corrosion, such as rust, pitting, and cracking. The application of deep learning in this context is particularly beneficial as it enables automated and efficient inspection, reducing the need for manual labor and improving the accuracy of corrosion detection.

One of the key advantages of using deep learning for structural corrosion detection is its ability to learn complex features from large datasets. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for instance, are particularly well-suited for image analysis tasks. They can automatically extract relevant features from images, such as color, texture, and shape, which are essential for identifying signs of corrosion. By training on a large dataset of images, these models can learn to distinguish between normal and corroded surfaces, enabling accurate and reliable detection of corrosion. This is particularly useful in the context of structural health monitoring, where timely and accurate detection of corrosion is crucial for maintaining the integrity of structures.

Ensemble learning techniques further enhance the effectiveness of deep learning in structural corrosion detection. Ensemble learning involves combining the predictions of multiple models to improve overall performance. This approach can help to reduce the risk of overfitting and increase the robustness of the models. In the context of structural corrosion detection, ensemble learning can be used to combine the strengths of different deep learning models, such as CNNs and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to create a more comprehensive and accurate detection system. By leveraging the diverse capabilities of these models, ensemble learning can provide a more reliable and consistent approach to corrosion detection.

The integration of drone-based imagery with deep learning models has also opened up new possibilities for structural corrosion assessment. Drones can capture high-resolution images of structures from various angles, providing a comprehensive view of the surface. These images can then be processed using deep learning algorithms to identify and assess corrosion. This approach not only improves the efficiency of corrosion detection but also enhances the accuracy of the assessment, as it allows for the detection of corrosion in areas that may be difficult to access manually.

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning in structural corrosion detection. For example, research has shown that deep learning models can accurately detect and classify different types of corrosion, such as pitting and general corrosion, using drone-based imagery [154]. These models can also provide detailed assessments of the extent and severity of corrosion, enabling engineers to make informed decisions about maintenance and repair. This is particularly important in the context of aging infrastructure, where the risk of corrosion is a major concern.

Another important aspect of deep learning in structural corrosion detection is its ability to handle large and complex datasets. Structural corrosion detection involves the analysis of a vast amount of data, including images, sensor data, and historical records. Deep learning models are well-suited for this task, as they can efficiently process and analyze large datasets. This is particularly beneficial in the context of structural health monitoring, where real-time data processing is essential for timely detection and response.

In addition to traditional deep learning approaches, recent advancements in self-supervised learning have also shown promise in structural corrosion detection. Self-supervised learning allows models to learn from unlabeled data, which is particularly useful in the context of structural corrosion detection, where labeled data may be scarce. By leveraging self-supervised learning techniques, deep learning models can learn to identify corrosion patterns without the need for extensive manual labeling, making the process more efficient and cost-effective.

The use of ensemble learning techniques in conjunction with deep learning models has further improved the accuracy and reliability of structural corrosion detection. Ensemble learning allows for the combination of multiple models, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, to create a more robust and accurate detection system. This approach is particularly effective in the context of structural corrosion detection, where the ability to handle diverse and complex data is crucial.

Moreover, the integration of deep learning with other technologies, such as computer vision and sensor networks, has further enhanced the capabilities of structural corrosion detection. Computer vision techniques can be used to analyze images and identify patterns of corrosion, while sensor networks can provide real-time data on the condition of structures. By combining these technologies, deep learning models can provide a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of structural corrosion, enabling timely and effective maintenance and repair.

In conclusion, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for structural corrosion detection, offering innovative solutions to overcome traditional limitations in corrosion assessment. The application of deep learning models, particularly through the use of drone-based imagery and ensemble learning techniques, has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of corrosion detection. As the field of structural health monitoring continues to evolve, the integration of deep learning with other technologies will play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and integrity of structures. The ongoing research in this area will further enhance the capabilities of deep learning in structural corrosion detection, paving the way for more effective and reliable methods of corrosion assessment and management.

### 5.15 Reinforcement Learning for UAV-Based Damage Detection

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for optimizing the control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in structural health monitoring (SHM) tasks, particularly for damage detection in hard-to-reach areas or during ongoing traffic [155]. Traditional methods of structural inspection often rely on manual assessments or fixed sensor networks, which may not be feasible in complex or hazardous environments. RL offers a novel approach by enabling UAVs to autonomously navigate, collect data, and perform real-time damage detection, thereby enhancing the efficiency and safety of SHM operations. This subsection explores how RL is applied in the context of UAV-based damage detection, highlighting its advantages, challenges, and potential for future development.

One of the primary applications of RL in UAV-based SHM is the optimization of flight paths and data acquisition strategies. UAVs equipped with high-resolution cameras or other sensors can traverse complex environments and capture detailed images or sensor data for damage assessment. However, the success of such tasks depends on the UAV's ability to adapt to dynamic conditions, such as changing weather, obstacles, and varying structural geometries. RL algorithms can be trained to make real-time decisions about flight trajectories, sensor positioning, and data collection, ensuring that the UAV collects the most relevant and high-quality information for damage detection [155]. For instance, a reinforcement learning model can learn to prioritize areas of the structure that are most likely to exhibit damage based on previous observations, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of the inspection process.

Another key application of RL in UAV-based SHM is the integration of damage detection algorithms directly into the UAV's control system. This allows the UAV to not only collect data but also analyze it on the fly, identifying potential damage and adjusting its behavior accordingly. For example, a UAV could be trained to detect cracks or structural deformities in real-time using onboard deep learning models. If a potential issue is identified, the UAV can autonomously adjust its flight path to obtain additional data or alert human operators for further inspection [155]. This capability is particularly valuable in hard-to-reach areas, where manual inspections may be impractical or dangerous.

RL also enables UAVs to operate in environments with high levels of uncertainty and variability. In real-world scenarios, UAVs may encounter unexpected obstacles, sensor noise, or changing environmental conditions. RL algorithms can be trained to handle such uncertainties by continuously learning and adapting to new situations. For instance, a UAV could be trained to avoid obstacles or reconfigure its flight path in response to sudden changes in the environment, ensuring that it continues to collect valuable data even under challenging conditions. This adaptability makes RL an ideal choice for UAV-based SHM in complex or dynamic environments [155].

Moreover, RL can be used to optimize the energy consumption of UAVs during SHM tasks. UAVs often have limited battery life, and efficient energy management is critical for extending their operational time. RL algorithms can be trained to find the optimal balance between data collection and energy usage, ensuring that the UAV can complete its inspection tasks without running out of power. For example, a UAV could be trained to prioritize areas of the structure that are most critical for damage assessment while minimizing unnecessary movements or sensor activations. This approach not only improves the efficiency of the UAV but also reduces the need for frequent recharging or battery replacements, making it more cost-effective and practical for long-term monitoring [155].

Despite the promising applications of RL in UAV-based SHM, there are several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the need for large and diverse training datasets to ensure that the RL algorithms can generalize well to real-world scenarios. Unlike traditional control systems, which rely on predefined rules, RL algorithms require extensive training to learn the optimal policies for different situations. This can be particularly challenging in SHM applications, where the structural environments and damage patterns can vary significantly. To overcome this, researchers have explored the use of synthetic data generation techniques, such as simulation-based training or data augmentation, to create more diverse and representative datasets for training RL models [155].

Another challenge is the computational complexity of training RL algorithms, especially for real-time applications. RL models often require significant computational resources to train and execute, which can be a limitation for UAVs with limited onboard processing capabilities. To address this, researchers have investigated lightweight RL architectures and efficient training strategies that can reduce the computational burden while maintaining performance. Additionally, the integration of edge computing and cloud-based processing can help offload some of the computational tasks, allowing UAVs to perform real-time damage detection with minimal latency [155].

In conclusion, the application of reinforcement learning in UAV-based damage detection is a promising area of research that has the potential to revolutionize structural health monitoring. By enabling UAVs to autonomously navigate, collect data, and perform real-time damage detection, RL offers a more efficient, flexible, and safe approach to SHM. While there are challenges to be addressed, such as the need for large training datasets and the computational demands of RL algorithms, the continued development of these technologies is expected to enhance the capabilities of UAVs in structural health monitoring. As the field progresses, the integration of RL with other advanced technologies, such as deep learning and computer vision, will likely play a crucial role in advancing the accuracy and effectiveness of UAV-based damage detection systems [155].

### 5.16 Explainable AI for Structural Health Monitoring

Explainable AI (XAI) plays a crucial role in structural health monitoring (SHM) by enhancing the transparency and interpretability of deep learning models, which are often perceived as "black boxes" due to their complex internal mechanisms. In SHM, decisions made by these models can have significant implications for public safety, infrastructure integrity, and disaster preparedness. Therefore, the ability to understand and trust the predictions made by these models is essential. XAI techniques provide insights into how models arrive at their conclusions, making them more reliable and trustworthy for engineers and decision-makers.

One of the key challenges in SHM is the need for models that can not only detect damage but also provide clear explanations for their predictions. Traditional deep learning models, while effective in identifying patterns and making predictions, often lack the ability to articulate why a particular decision was made. This limitation can be particularly problematic in safety-critical applications where the consequences of incorrect predictions can be severe. XAI addresses this by offering methods to interpret model outputs, such as feature importance analysis, visualization of decision-making processes, and the use of interpretable models that can be easily understood by humans.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of XAI in SHM. For example, in the study titled "Explainable AI models for predicting liquefaction-induced lateral spreading" [17], researchers used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model for predicting lateral spreading. The SHAP analysis revealed the factors driving the model's predictions, enhancing transparency and allowing for comparison with established engineering knowledge. This approach not only improves the model's reliability but also facilitates the integration of domain-specific knowledge into the model's decision-making process. Similarly, the study "Glass-box model representation of seismic failure mode prediction for conventional RC shear walls" [4] emphasized the importance of interpretable models in seismic performance assessment. The authors proposed a glass-box classification model that provides insights into the decision-making process, allowing engineers to verify the model's predictions against physical principles and engineering standards.

In addition to improving model transparency, XAI techniques can also help in identifying the most critical features that influence the model's predictions. This is particularly useful in SHM, where the availability of data is often limited. By highlighting the most relevant features, XAI can guide the selection of data for training and validation, leading to more efficient and effective models. For instance, in the study "Estimate Deformation Capacity of Non-Ductile RC Shear Walls using Explainable Boosting Machine" [52], the authors developed an interpretable machine learning model that provided insights into the relationship between wall properties and deformation capacity. The model's ability to quantify the individual contribution of each wall property and the correlations among them made it a valuable tool for engineers in assessing the performance of structural components.

Moreover, XAI techniques can also be used to validate and improve the performance of deep learning models in SHM. By analyzing the model's decision-making process, engineers can identify potential issues such as overfitting, bias, or incorrect feature selection. This can lead to the refinement of the model, resulting in more accurate and reliable predictions. For example, the study "Physics-informed Neural Networks for Dynamic Stress Prediction" [156] demonstrated how the integration of physics-based constraints into deep learning models can improve their interpretability and reliability. The authors used a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to predict dynamic stress distributions, incorporating physical laws into the model's loss function. This approach not only enhanced the model's accuracy but also provided insights into the underlying physical processes, making the model's predictions more interpretable.

Another important aspect of XAI in SHM is its ability to facilitate collaboration between engineers and data scientists. By providing clear explanations of model predictions, XAI can bridge the gap between technical expertise and domain knowledge, enabling more informed decision-making. This is particularly relevant in complex systems where the interplay between different factors can be difficult to understand. The study "Physics-Guided Recurrent Neural Networks For Modeling Dynamical Systems Application to Monitoring Water Temperature And Quality In Lakes" [157] demonstrated how the integration of physical knowledge into recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can improve the model's interpretability and performance. The authors showed that by incorporating physical constraints, the model could achieve better prediction accuracy and provide insights into the underlying dynamics of the system.

In conclusion, explainable AI techniques are essential for enhancing the transparency and interpretability of deep learning models in structural health monitoring. By providing insights into the decision-making process, XAI not only improves the reliability of these models but also facilitates their integration into real-world applications. As the field of SHM continues to evolve, the development and application of XAI techniques will play a vital role in ensuring that deep learning models are not only accurate but also trustworthy and interpretable. The studies mentioned above highlight the potential of XAI in addressing the challenges of SHM and underscore the importance of continued research in this area.

### 5.17 Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Structural Health Monitoring

Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has emerged as a promising approach for structural health monitoring (SHM) by integrating domain-specific knowledge and physical laws into the machine learning framework. This hybrid approach ensures that models not only learn from data but also respect the underlying physics of the system, thereby improving accuracy, interpretability, and generalization capabilities. In the context of SHM, PIML enables the development of robust and reliable models for detecting and assessing structural damage, which is critical for ensuring the safety and longevity of civil infrastructure.

One of the key benefits of PIML in SHM is its ability to incorporate physical constraints and governing equations into the learning process. Traditional machine learning models often rely solely on data, which can lead to overfitting and poor generalization, especially when data is scarce or noisy. In contrast, physics-informed models are designed to obey the principles of mechanics, such as equilibrium, conservation laws, and material behavior, thereby ensuring that the predictions made by the model are physically meaningful and reliable. For instance, in the field of earthquake engineering, PIML can be used to model the dynamic response of structures to seismic loading, taking into account the nonlinear behavior of materials and the complex interactions between different components of the structure [83].

The integration of physics-based models with machine learning is particularly valuable in scenarios where the availability of labeled data is limited. In SHM, the acquisition of high-quality labeled data—such as vibration signals or sensor readings—can be costly and time-consuming. PIML addresses this challenge by leveraging the knowledge of physical laws to constrain the learning process, reducing the dependence on large labeled datasets. For example, in a study on damage detection in bridges, researchers used a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that incorporated the equations of motion and material properties to improve the accuracy of damage localization and quantification [83]. By embedding these physical constraints, the model was able to generalize better to unseen conditions and provide more reliable predictions.

Another advantage of PIML in SHM is its ability to enhance the interpretability of machine learning models. Traditional deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are often considered as "black boxes" because their decision-making processes are not transparent. In contrast, physics-informed models can be designed to explicitly encode the physical relationships between input features and output predictions. This not only improves the interpretability of the model but also makes it easier to validate and trust the results in safety-critical applications. For instance, a physics-informed approach was used to develop a damage detection model that incorporated the principles of structural mechanics to explain the relationship between vibration patterns and damage severity [83]. This enabled engineers to better understand the underlying causes of damage and make informed decisions about maintenance and repair.

In addition to improving accuracy and interpretability, PIML also offers significant benefits in terms of model robustness and generalization. By incorporating physical knowledge into the learning process, PIML models are less likely to produce erroneous predictions when faced with out-of-distribution data or extreme conditions. This is particularly important in SHM, where the operating conditions of a structure can vary widely depending on factors such as temperature, humidity, and load levels. For example, a physics-informed model was developed for monitoring the health of a composite material under varying environmental conditions. The model integrated the thermal and mechanical properties of the material into its architecture, enabling it to accurately predict the structural behavior even when the input data was noisy or incomplete [83]. This level of robustness is crucial for ensuring the reliability of SHM systems in real-world applications.

Moreover, PIML can be used to address the limitations of purely data-driven models in capturing the complex, nonlinear behavior of structures. In many cases, the relationship between input features and output predictions is not straightforward, and traditional machine learning models may struggle to capture these relationships accurately. PIML overcomes this limitation by explicitly encoding the physical laws that govern the behavior of the system. For instance, in a study on the detection of cracks in concrete structures, researchers used a physics-informed model that incorporated the principles of fracture mechanics to improve the accuracy of crack localization. The model was able to capture the nonlinear behavior of the material and provide more reliable predictions compared to a purely data-driven approach [83].

The application of PIML in SHM also opens up new possibilities for real-time monitoring and decision-making. By integrating physics-based models with machine learning, it is possible to develop lightweight and efficient algorithms that can process sensor data in real time. This is particularly important in applications such as earthquake early warning systems, where timely and accurate predictions can save lives and minimize damage. For example, a physics-informed model was developed to monitor the structural health of a high-rise building in real time, using sensor data from accelerometers and strain gauges. The model incorporated the equations of motion and material properties to predict the dynamic response of the building under seismic loading, enabling early detection of potential damage [83].

In conclusion, the integration of physics-based models with machine learning has the potential to revolutionize structural health monitoring by enhancing the accuracy, interpretability, and robustness of damage detection systems. As demonstrated by various studies, physics-informed machine learning offers a powerful framework for addressing the challenges of SHM, particularly in scenarios where data is scarce or noisy. By combining the strengths of machine learning and physics, PIML provides a promising direction for developing reliable and efficient SHM systems that can support the safety and resilience of critical infrastructure.

### 5.18 Sensor Network Data Analysis Using Graph Neural Networks

Sensor networks play a crucial role in structural health monitoring (SHM) by providing continuous data from multiple sensors distributed across structures. These sensors collect diverse types of data, such as vibration, strain, temperature, and acceleration, which are critical for detecting and assessing structural damage. However, the complexity and interdependencies of the data generated by these sensor networks pose significant challenges for traditional data analysis techniques. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing such complex, interconnected data by explicitly modeling relationships and dependencies among sensors, making them well-suited for SHM applications [40].

GNNs are a class of deep learning models designed to operate on graph-structured data, where nodes represent entities (such as sensors) and edges represent relationships or interactions between these entities. In the context of SHM, each sensor can be treated as a node, and the relationships between sensors—such as spatial proximity, temporal correlation, or functional dependencies—can be represented as edges. This graph structure allows GNNs to capture the intricate dependencies in sensor network data, which is often overlooked by conventional machine learning methods that treat data points as independent entities. For example, in a large-scale bridge monitoring system, the vibration patterns of sensors located near each other are likely to be correlated due to the structural coupling of the bridge. A GNN can explicitly model these relationships, enabling more accurate damage detection and localization [26].

One of the key advantages of using GNNs in SHM is their ability to handle heterogeneous sensor data. In real-world SHM systems, sensors can have different types, sampling rates, and measurement ranges. GNNs can integrate these diverse data sources by assigning different features to each node and edge, enabling the model to learn meaningful representations that capture both the intrinsic properties of individual sensors and their interactions with neighboring sensors. For example, a GNN can model a network of strain gauges, accelerometers, and temperature sensors, where each sensor node has features such as sensor type, location, and historical data, and the edges between nodes encode spatial or temporal relationships. This flexible modeling approach allows GNNs to adapt to the unique characteristics of different SHM systems [158].

The application of GNNs in SHM is further enhanced by their ability to incorporate domain knowledge into the model design. In many SHM applications, the relationships between sensors are not arbitrary but are governed by physical laws or engineering principles. For instance, the structural response of a building is influenced by the spatial distribution of its sensors, and certain sensors may be more sensitive to specific types of damage. By embedding such domain knowledge into the graph structure—such as using spatial coordinates to define edges or incorporating sensor-specific constraints—GNNs can improve the interpretability and accuracy of their predictions. This integration of domain knowledge with data-driven learning makes GNNs particularly effective in SHM tasks where physical consistency is critical [7].

Another significant benefit of GNNs in SHM is their scalability and efficiency in handling large-scale sensor networks. Traditional machine learning models often struggle with the high dimensionality and computational complexity of sensor data, especially when dealing with thousands of sensors. GNNs, on the other hand, can process graph-structured data efficiently by leveraging message-passing mechanisms that propagate information through the network. This enables the model to capture long-range dependencies and global patterns, which are essential for detecting subtle changes in structural behavior. For example, in a smart city infrastructure monitoring system with hundreds of sensors, a GNN can efficiently analyze the entire network to identify anomalous patterns that may indicate structural degradation [26].

Furthermore, GNNs can be combined with other advanced techniques, such as temporal modeling and attention mechanisms, to enhance their performance in SHM. By incorporating temporal dynamics, GNNs can capture the evolution of sensor data over time, which is crucial for detecting progressive damage. For instance, a GNN can model the temporal relationships between sensors by constructing a dynamic graph where the edges change over time based on the sensor data. This allows the model to track how damage propagates through the structure and identify early warning signs of failure [112]. Additionally, attention mechanisms can be used to highlight the most relevant sensors or relationships in the graph, improving the model’s interpretability and decision-making capabilities [159].

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of GNNs in various SHM tasks, including damage detection, localization, and prognosis. For example, a GNN-based approach was used to analyze vibration data from a bridge equipped with a dense array of accelerometers, and the model successfully identified damage locations with high accuracy [148]. Another study employed GNNs to detect anomalies in sensor data from a high-rise building, where the model outperformed traditional methods by capturing the complex dependencies among sensors [26]. These results highlight the potential of GNNs to revolutionize SHM by enabling more accurate, scalable, and interpretable analysis of sensor network data.

In summary, the use of GNNs in SHM offers a promising approach to analyzing complex sensor network data by explicitly modeling relationships and dependencies among sensors. Their ability to handle heterogeneous data, incorporate domain knowledge, and scale to large networks makes them well-suited for a wide range of SHM applications. As the field of SHM continues to evolve, the integration of GNNs with other advanced techniques will play a crucial role in improving the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of structural health monitoring systems.

### 5.19 Time-Series Analysis for Structural Health Monitoring

Time-series analysis plays a critical role in structural health monitoring (SHM) by enabling the detection and prediction of structural damage through the analysis of vibration and sensor data. Traditional SHM methods often rely on manual inspection and static analysis, which are time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error. With the advent of machine learning, particularly deep learning techniques, time-series analysis has become a powerful tool for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. Among these techniques, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and attention mechanisms have emerged as key methodologies for processing sequential data and capturing temporal dependencies.

LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to handle long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them well-suited for time-series analysis. In the context of SHM, LSTMs have been widely used to analyze vibration data from sensors installed on structures such as buildings, bridges, and dams. These networks can learn complex patterns in the data, such as changes in frequency, amplitude, and phase, which are indicative of potential damage. For example, a study by [10] demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning models, including LSTMs, in processing seismic data and identifying subtle changes in structural behavior. By leveraging the temporal structure of vibration data, LSTMs can detect early signs of damage that might be missed by traditional methods.

Attention mechanisms further enhance the capabilities of time-series analysis by allowing models to focus on the most relevant parts of the data. In SHM, attention mechanisms can be used to highlight critical features in the vibration signals, such as sudden spikes or anomalies, which are often associated with structural degradation. A study by [15] emphasized the importance of attention mechanisms in improving the accuracy of seismic phase picking and earthquake detection. By dynamically adjusting the weights assigned to different time steps, attention mechanisms enable models to better interpret complex vibration patterns and improve their predictive performance.

The application of LSTM and attention mechanisms in SHM is not limited to damage detection; it also extends to predictive maintenance and risk assessment. Predictive maintenance involves using historical data to forecast the remaining useful life of a structure and schedule maintenance activities accordingly. LSTM networks can be trained on large datasets of vibration and sensor data to learn the relationship between operational conditions and structural health. For instance, [20] demonstrated the use of LSTM networks to predict the time to start of failure (TTsF) and time to the end of failure (TTeF) in laboratory earthquakes. This approach can be adapted to real-world structures, allowing engineers to proactively address potential failures before they occur.

Moreover, the integration of attention mechanisms with LSTMs enhances the interpretability of models, which is crucial in SHM applications. Structural engineers often require not only accurate predictions but also insights into the underlying causes of damage. Attention mechanisms provide a way to visualize which parts of the vibration data are most influential in the model's predictions, enabling engineers to identify the root causes of structural degradation. This level of interpretability is particularly valuable in complex structures where multiple factors can contribute to damage, such as aging, environmental stress, and operational loads.

Another significant advantage of using LSTM and attention mechanisms in SHM is their ability to handle noisy and incomplete data. Structural sensors can be affected by environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, which can introduce noise into the data. LSTMs are robust to such noise due to their ability to learn from sequences and ignore irrelevant information. Additionally, attention mechanisms can help filter out noise by focusing on the most relevant features of the data. This is particularly important in SHM, where data quality can vary significantly due to sensor limitations and environmental conditions.

In practice, the implementation of time-series analysis techniques for SHM often involves the use of hybrid models that combine LSTMs with other machine learning algorithms. For example, [10] explored the integration of LSTM networks with physics-based models to improve the accuracy of fault zone stress predictions. By incorporating physical constraints into the model, these hybrid approaches can achieve better generalization and reliability compared to purely data-driven models. Similarly, [7] demonstrated the effectiveness of combining LSTM networks with Newton's second law to capture the dynamic behavior of structures under seismic loads.

The use of time-series analysis in SHM also benefits from advancements in data acquisition and sensor technology. Modern structures are equipped with a wide array of sensors, such as accelerometers, strain gauges, and fiber optic sensors, which provide high-resolution data over time. This abundance of data enables the training of more sophisticated models that can capture subtle changes in structural behavior. For instance, [90] highlighted the potential of satellite-based data in complementing ground-based sensor networks for SHM. By integrating data from multiple sources, time-series analysis techniques can provide a more comprehensive understanding of structural health.

In conclusion, time-series analysis techniques, particularly LSTM networks and attention mechanisms, have revolutionized structural health monitoring by enabling real-time damage detection, predictive maintenance, and risk assessment. These methods are capable of processing complex vibration and sensor data, capturing temporal dependencies, and improving the interpretability of models. As the field of SHM continues to evolve, the integration of time-series analysis with physics-based models and hybrid approaches will play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and resilience of critical infrastructure. The ongoing development of these techniques will further enhance their effectiveness in addressing the challenges of structural health monitoring in an increasingly complex and dynamic environment.

### 5.20 Challenges and Future Directions in Structural Health Monitoring

[18]
Structural health monitoring (SHM) has become increasingly vital for ensuring the safety, reliability, and longevity of critical infrastructure such as bridges, buildings, and dams. The integration of machine learning (ML) in SHM has shown great promise in enabling early damage detection, condition assessment, and predictive maintenance. However, despite these advancements, several challenges remain in the application of ML to SHM. These challenges include data scarcity, model generalization, interpretability, and computational efficiency, among others. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the development of robust and effective SHM systems.

One of the primary challenges in applying ML to SHM is data scarcity. Structural health monitoring systems typically rely on continuous sensor data, such as vibration, strain, and acceleration measurements, to detect anomalies and assess structural integrity. However, obtaining high-quality, labeled datasets that capture a wide range of damage scenarios is often difficult and expensive. The limited availability of such data restricts the ability of ML models to learn robust and generalizable representations of structural behavior. Additionally, the data collected from real-world structures can be noisy, incomplete, or inconsistent, further complicating the training process. For instance, in the study by "K-Link: Knowledge-Link Graph from LLMs for Enhanced Representation Learning in Multivariate Time-Series Data" [160], the authors highlight the challenges of constructing reliable graphs from multivariate time-series data, which is a critical step in many ML-based SHM approaches.

Another significant challenge is model generalization. ML models trained on data from specific structures or environments may not perform well when applied to new or unseen structures. This limitation is particularly problematic in SHM, where structural configurations, materials, and environmental conditions can vary widely. The ability of a model to generalize across different types of structures and operating conditions is essential for its practical deployment. However, current ML models often struggle with this task, as they tend to overfit to the characteristics of the training data. For example, the study by "Generalized Neural Networks for Real-Time Earthquake Early Warning" [22] demonstrates that neural networks trained in one region may not generalize well to other regions, highlighting the need for more robust and transferable models.

Interpretability is another critical challenge in ML-based SHM. While deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in damage detection and classification tasks, they often operate as "black boxes," making it difficult to understand how they arrive at their predictions. This lack of transparency can be a significant barrier to their adoption in safety-critical applications, where stakeholders require clear and interpretable results. The study by "Explainable AI for Structural Health Monitoring" [161] emphasizes the importance of developing interpretable models that can provide insights into the decision-making process, enabling engineers to trust and act upon the model's outputs.

Computational efficiency is another key challenge in SHM, particularly for real-time monitoring and early warning systems. Many ML models, especially deep learning architectures, require significant computational resources to train and deploy. This can be a limiting factor in resource-constrained environments, where real-time processing is essential. The study by "Edge-Varying Fourier Graph Networks for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting" [162] highlights the importance of developing efficient algorithms that can handle large-scale data while maintaining high accuracy.

Future research directions in ML-based SHM should focus on addressing these challenges. One promising avenue is the development of data augmentation techniques to overcome data scarcity. Methods such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and transfer learning can be used to generate synthetic data that mimics real-world conditions, thereby expanding the training dataset and improving model performance. The study by "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Seismic Data Generation and Enhancement" [163] demonstrates the effectiveness of GANs in generating realistic seismic data, which could be adapted for SHM applications.

Another important direction is the development of more generalizable models. This could involve the use of domain adaptation techniques, where models trained on data from one domain are adapted to perform well on data from another domain. The study by "Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation" [95] highlights the potential of transfer learning in addressing the challenges of model generalization. Additionally, the integration of physics-based models with ML techniques can help improve the interpretability and reliability of predictions, as seen in the study by "Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Structural Health Monitoring" [164].

Interpretable ML models are also a critical area for future research. Techniques such as attention mechanisms, feature importance analysis, and model-agnostic interpretability methods can be used to provide insights into the decision-making process of ML models. The study by "Interpretable Deep Learning for Structural Damage Classification" [69] demonstrates the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing the transparency of deep learning models.

Finally, the development of efficient and scalable ML algorithms is essential for real-time SHM applications. This could involve the use of lightweight neural network architectures, edge computing, and parallel processing techniques. The study by "Real-Time Processing and Efficient Algorithms" [165] highlights the importance of optimizing ML models for real-time performance.

In conclusion, while ML has shown great potential in SHM, several challenges remain in its application. Addressing these challenges through future research will be crucial for the development of robust, generalizable, and interpretable ML models that can effectively support the safety and reliability of critical infrastructure. By leveraging data augmentation, transfer learning, physics-informed models, and efficient algorithms, the field of ML-based SHM can continue to advance and meet the growing demands of modern infrastructure monitoring.

## 6 Integration of Machine Learning with Physics-Based Models

### 6.1 Overview of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent a significant advancement in the integration of machine learning with domain-specific knowledge, particularly in the realm of earthquake engineering. These networks are designed to incorporate physical laws and constraints directly into the training process, ensuring that the models not only fit the data but also adhere to the fundamental principles governing the physical system. This approach significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of predictions, making PINNs a powerful tool in various applications, including seismic response analysis, structural health monitoring, and earthquake prediction. By embedding physical knowledge into the neural network architecture, PINNs can overcome the limitations of purely data-driven models, which often lack interpretability and may not generalize well to new scenarios.

The core idea behind PINNs is to leverage the governing equations of a physical system, such as the equations of motion, energy conservation, or material constitutive laws, as constraints during the training of neural networks. This is achieved by modifying the loss function of the neural network to include terms that enforce these physical laws. For instance, in the context of earthquake engineering, PINNs can be trained to predict the dynamic response of structures under seismic loading while ensuring that the predicted responses comply with the laws of physics [7]. This integration of physical constraints not only improves the model's accuracy but also enhances its robustness, as it prevents the neural network from learning spurious patterns that do not conform to the underlying physical principles.

One of the key advantages of PINNs is their ability to handle complex physical systems with high-dimensional data. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite element analysis, often struggle with computational efficiency, especially when dealing with large-scale simulations. PINNs, on the other hand, can provide accurate predictions with relatively fewer computational resources, making them a viable alternative for real-time applications. For example, in the study on "Physics-Informed Recurrent Neural Networks for Seismic Response Evaluation of Nonlinear Systems," researchers demonstrated that PINNs can accurately predict the seismic response of nonlinear structures while maintaining the physical consistency of the results [92]. This is particularly important in earthquake engineering, where the ability to predict the behavior of structures under extreme loading conditions is critical for ensuring safety and resilience.

Another significant benefit of PINNs is their capacity to handle sparse and noisy data. In earthquake engineering, the availability of high-quality, labeled data is often limited due to the rarity of seismic events and the challenges associated with data collection. PINNs can mitigate this issue by incorporating physical constraints into the training process, which helps to regularize the model and reduce the risk of overfitting. This is especially useful in scenarios where the training data is insufficient or of poor quality. For instance, in the study on "Machine learning based surrogate modeling with SVD enabled training for nonlinear civil structures subject to dynamic loading," the authors demonstrated that PINNs can effectively predict the response of nonlinear structures even when the training data is limited [166].

Moreover, PINNs can be used to enhance the interpretability of machine learning models, which is a critical requirement in earthquake engineering. Traditional black-box models, such as deep neural networks, often lack transparency, making it difficult to understand how the model arrives at its predictions. PINNs address this issue by embedding physical laws and domain knowledge into the model, providing a more interpretable framework for decision-making. This is particularly important in applications such as structural health monitoring, where the ability to understand and trust the model's predictions is essential for ensuring the safety of critical infrastructure. For example, in the study on "Glass-box model representation of seismic failure mode prediction for conventional RC shear walls," the authors emphasized the importance of interpretability in machine learning models for seismic failure mode prediction, highlighting the potential of PINNs to provide transparent and reliable predictions [4].

In addition to improving accuracy and interpretability, PINNs can also enhance the generalizability of machine learning models. By incorporating physical constraints, PINNs can generalize better to unseen scenarios, which is crucial in earthquake engineering, where the ability to predict the behavior of structures under various seismic conditions is essential. For instance, in the study on "Generalized Neural Networks for Real-Time Earthquake Early Warning," the authors demonstrated that PINNs can be trained to generalize across different regions and monitoring setups, enabling real-time earthquake early warning systems [22]. This is particularly important in regions with limited seismic data, where the ability to extrapolate from existing data to new scenarios is critical for effective disaster management.

The integration of PINNs with physics-based models also opens up new possibilities for hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of machine learning and traditional physics-based simulations. These hybrid models can leverage the data-driven capabilities of machine learning while ensuring that the predictions remain physically consistent. For example, in the study on "Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Seismic Response Prediction OF Nonlinear Steel Moment Resisting Frame Structures," the authors proposed a novel framework that combines the advantages of physics-informed neural networks with the accuracy of traditional finite element analysis, resulting in improved predictions of seismic responses [7].

In conclusion, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a powerful and flexible framework for integrating machine learning with domain-specific knowledge in earthquake engineering. By incorporating physical laws and constraints into the training process, PINNs enhance the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of predictions, making them a valuable tool for a wide range of applications. As the field of earthquake engineering continues to evolve, the use of PINNs is expected to play an increasingly important role in addressing the challenges of seismic risk assessment, structural health monitoring, and earthquake prediction.

### 6.2 Types of Physics-Informed Frameworks

Physics-informed frameworks represent a class of machine learning models that integrate physical laws and domain knowledge into the training process. These frameworks aim to enhance the reliability, interpretability, and generalizability of machine learning models by ensuring that their predictions are consistent with the underlying physical principles. Among the different types of physics-informed frameworks, physics-guided neural networks (PgNNs), physics-informed neural networks (PiNNs), and physics-encoded neural networks (PeNNs) are prominent. Each of these frameworks has distinct advantages and applications in scientific computing, particularly in the field of earthquake engineering.

Physics-guided neural networks (PgNNs) are designed to incorporate domain-specific knowledge and physical constraints directly into the network architecture. This is achieved by modifying the neural network's structure or loss function to reflect the underlying physics of the problem. For instance, PgNNs can be used to enforce conservation laws, such as energy or momentum conservation, by embedding these principles into the network's training process. This approach ensures that the model's predictions are not only accurate but also physically meaningful. A study by [167] demonstrated that PgNNs can effectively model complex physical systems by integrating prior physical knowledge into the deep learning framework. By doing so, these models can achieve higher accuracy and better generalization compared to purely data-driven approaches. The application of PgNNs in earthquake engineering can be seen in the development of models that predict seismic responses while adhering to the laws of motion and energy conservation.

In contrast, physics-informed neural networks (PiNNs) focus on embedding physical equations into the loss function of the neural network. This is done by formulating the loss function to include terms that enforce the satisfaction of governing physical equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid dynamics or the equations of motion for solid mechanics. By doing so, PiNNs ensure that the model's predictions are consistent with the physical laws that govern the system. For example, [7] proposed a PiNN method that incorporates Newton's second law into the neural network architecture to model the seismic responses of nonlinear structures. This approach not only improves the accuracy of the predictions but also enhances the interpretability of the model by ensuring that the predictions are grounded in physical principles. The use of PiNNs in earthquake engineering can lead to more reliable predictions of structural responses under seismic loading, as the models are trained to respect the physical constraints of the system.

Physics-encoded neural networks (PeNNs) take a different approach by encoding the physical laws directly into the network's architecture. This is achieved by designing the network to explicitly model the underlying physical equations, which can be particularly useful for problems where the governing equations are well understood. PeNNs can be used to model systems where the physical laws are known and can be encoded into the network, allowing for more accurate and efficient simulations. For instance, [168] explored the use of PeNNs to solve linear partial differential equations (PDEs) by encoding the physical laws into the Gaussian process framework. This approach not only improves the accuracy of the predictions but also provides a structured way to quantify the uncertainty in the model's output. The application of PeNNs in earthquake engineering can be seen in the development of models that simulate the propagation of seismic waves through the Earth's crust while adhering to the physical laws of wave propagation.

Each of these physics-informed frameworks has distinct advantages and applications in scientific computing. PgNNs are particularly effective in scenarios where the physical constraints are well defined and can be incorporated into the network architecture. PiNNs, on the other hand, are ideal for problems where the governing equations are known and can be embedded into the loss function to ensure that the model's predictions are physically consistent. PeNNs offer a powerful approach for problems where the physical laws are well understood and can be encoded directly into the network's architecture, leading to more accurate and efficient simulations.

The integration of these physics-informed frameworks into machine learning models has the potential to revolutionize the field of earthquake engineering. By ensuring that the models' predictions are consistent with the underlying physical principles, these frameworks can improve the reliability and interpretability of the models. For example, [10] demonstrated the effectiveness of PiNNs in modeling fault friction by incorporating the physics of motion in the solid Earth into the neural network architecture. This approach not only improved the accuracy of the predictions but also enhanced the model's ability to generalize to different fault conditions.

In addition to improving the accuracy and reliability of the models, physics-informed frameworks can also reduce the computational cost of simulations. By incorporating physical laws into the model, these frameworks can avoid the need for extensive numerical simulations, which are often computationally expensive. This is particularly important in earthquake engineering, where the ability to perform real-time simulations can have significant implications for disaster response and risk assessment.

Overall, the development and application of physics-informed frameworks represent a significant advancement in the field of machine learning for earthquake engineering. By integrating physical knowledge and domain-specific constraints into the training process, these frameworks can enhance the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of the models, leading to more effective solutions for earthquake prediction, monitoring, and risk assessment. As the field continues to evolve, the continued refinement and application of these frameworks will be crucial for addressing the complex challenges associated with seismic events.

### 6.3 Integration with Governing Equations

The integration of physics-based models with machine learning techniques has become a key area of research in earthquake engineering. One of the most promising approaches is the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which allow the incorporation of governing physical equations into the training process of neural networks. By embedding physical laws directly into the loss function, PINNs ensure that the model adheres to the fundamental principles of physics during training, which is critical for applications where physical consistency is essential. This subsection explores the integration of governing equations into machine learning models, with a particular focus on how physics-informed neural networks achieve this goal.

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models designed to incorporate physical laws into their training process. Unlike traditional neural networks that are purely data-driven, PINNs are trained to satisfy both the observed data and the underlying physical equations. This is achieved by modifying the loss function to include terms that enforce the satisfaction of the governing equations. For example, in the case of seismic wave propagation, the wave equation can be embedded into the loss function, ensuring that the neural network’s predictions are consistent with the laws of physics. This approach not only improves the model’s accuracy but also enhances its generalization capabilities, as the model is constrained by physical principles rather than relying solely on data.

The integration of governing equations into the loss function of PINNs is a powerful strategy that addresses several challenges in earthquake engineering. One of the primary challenges in seismic modeling is the scarcity of high-quality, labeled data. By incorporating physical laws into the training process, PINNs can effectively learn from limited data, as the model is not solely dependent on the training dataset. For instance, in the study by [10], the authors demonstrated that PINNs can accurately model the dynamics of fault friction by incorporating the rate-and-state friction laws into the loss function. This approach not only improved the accuracy of the model but also ensured that the predictions adhered to the physical constraints of the system.

Another key advantage of PINNs is their ability to handle complex, nonlinear systems that are governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). In earthquake engineering, many phenomena, such as seismic wave propagation and fault slip, are governed by PDEs. Traditional numerical methods for solving these equations, such as finite element or finite difference methods, are computationally expensive and may not be feasible for large-scale simulations. PINNs offer a more efficient alternative by learning the solution to the PDEs directly from data while ensuring that the solution satisfies the governing equations. For example, in the study by [169], the authors used a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to predict 3D seismic wave propagation. The FNO was trained to satisfy the elastic wave equation, enabling it to accurately model the complex dynamics of seismic wave propagation.

The integration of governing equations into the loss function of PINNs also allows for the incorporation of boundary and initial conditions. In many seismic problems, the initial state of the system and the boundary conditions play a crucial role in determining the behavior of the system. By including these conditions in the loss function, PINNs can accurately model the evolution of the system over time. For instance, in the study by [7], the authors incorporated the equations of motion into the loss function to predict the seismic response of nonlinear steel structures. This approach ensured that the model adhered to the physical laws governing the system, resulting in more accurate predictions.

In addition to improving the accuracy of the model, the integration of governing equations into the loss function also enhances the interpretability of the model. Traditional deep learning models are often considered black-box models, as their internal workings are not easily understood. By incorporating physical laws into the training process, PINNs provide a more transparent and interpretable framework for understanding the predictions. For example, in the study by [79], the authors developed a physics-guided convolutional neural network (PhyCNN) that incorporated the laws of dynamics into the model. This approach not only improved the accuracy of the model but also allowed for a more intuitive understanding of how the model made its predictions.

The use of PINNs also enables the model to handle cases where the data is sparse or incomplete. In many seismic applications, the availability of high-quality, labeled data is limited, which can hinder the performance of traditional data-driven models. By incorporating physical laws into the training process, PINNs can effectively learn from limited data, as the model is constrained by the governing equations. For example, in the study by [10], the authors demonstrated that PINNs can accurately model the dynamics of fault friction even with limited data by incorporating the rate-and-state friction laws into the loss function. This approach not only improved the accuracy of the model but also ensured that the predictions were physically consistent.

In summary, the integration of governing equations into the loss function of physics-informed neural networks is a powerful approach that enhances the accuracy, generalization, and interpretability of machine learning models in earthquake engineering. By ensuring that the model adheres to the fundamental principles of physics, PINNs provide a more reliable and physically consistent framework for modeling complex seismic phenomena. The applications of this approach are wide-ranging, from seismic wave propagation to fault slip modeling, and they offer a promising direction for future research in earthquake engineering. The studies cited above demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and highlight the potential of PINNs in advancing the field of earthquake engineering.

### 6.4 Handling Unmeasurable States and Sparse Data

Integrating machine learning with physics-based models in earthquake engineering presents several challenges, especially when dealing with unmeasurable states and sparse data. In many real-world scenarios, the physical states of the system under investigation may not be directly measurable due to technical, economic, or environmental constraints. Furthermore, the availability of data may be limited, making it difficult to train robust and reliable models. Addressing these challenges is crucial for developing accurate and physically consistent predictions in seismic events and structural responses. Several methods have been proposed to tackle these issues, including the use of reduced loss terms and numerical integration techniques to improve model training and generalization in the presence of sparse or incomplete data.

One of the primary challenges when dealing with unmeasurable states is the lack of direct observations to inform the model. In such cases, models must rely on indirect evidence and physical constraints to infer the system's behavior. For example, in geophysical modeling and seismic inversion, the subsurface properties such as velocity or density may be difficult to measure directly. Instead, they must be inferred from surface measurements of seismic waves. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach to integrate physical laws into the learning process, allowing models to infer unmeasurable states by enforcing consistency with governing equations. This approach ensures that the model remains physically meaningful even when the data is sparse or incomplete [10].

When data is sparse, traditional machine learning models may struggle to generalize well, leading to overfitting or poor performance on unseen data. To address this, researchers have explored methods such as reduced loss terms, where the contribution of certain data points or states is minimized during training to focus on the most informative regions of the input space. This technique helps prevent the model from overfitting to noisy or sparse data and encourages it to learn the underlying physical patterns that govern the system. For instance, in seismic inversion tasks, where the data may be limited or noisy, the use of reduced loss terms can improve the robustness of the model by prioritizing the most reliable and consistent data points [80].

Another approach to handling unmeasurable states and sparse data is the use of numerical integration techniques. These methods allow the model to approximate the behavior of the system by integrating over the available data and applying physical constraints. In particular, numerical integration can be used to reconstruct missing or unmeasurable states by leveraging the known physical relationships between different variables. This is especially useful in scenarios where direct measurements are not available, but the system's behavior can be described by differential equations or other physical laws. By incorporating numerical integration into the learning process, models can simulate the behavior of the system even when some states are not directly observable [80].

Furthermore, the integration of numerical integration with physics-informed models can improve the accuracy of predictions in the presence of sparse data. For example, in structural health monitoring, where the data may be limited due to sensor placement or failure, numerical integration techniques can help fill in the gaps by simulating the expected behavior of the system under different loading conditions. This approach allows for more accurate damage detection and structural assessment, even when the available data is sparse [10].

The use of sparse data in machine learning models also necessitates the development of strategies to mitigate the effects of data scarcity. One such strategy is the use of data augmentation techniques, where synthetic data is generated to supplement the existing dataset. This can be particularly effective when combined with physics-informed models, as the synthetic data can be generated in a way that is consistent with the underlying physical laws. For instance, in seismic data processing, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been used to synthesize realistic seismic waveforms that preserve the physical characteristics of the data while increasing the size of the training set [28]. By incorporating physics-based constraints into the data generation process, these models can produce synthetic data that is both realistic and informative, thereby improving the generalization capabilities of the machine learning model.

In addition to data augmentation, the use of transfer learning has also proven to be effective in addressing the challenges of sparse data. Transfer learning allows models to leverage knowledge from related tasks or domains to improve performance on the target task, even when the data is limited. This is particularly useful in earthquake engineering, where the availability of labeled data for specific regions or events may be limited. By pre-training models on large, diverse datasets and then fine-tuning them on the specific task at hand, researchers can achieve better performance with less data [103]. This approach is especially relevant when dealing with unmeasurable states, as it allows models to generalize from existing knowledge to new, data-scarce scenarios.

Another important consideration in handling unmeasurable states and sparse data is the need for robust model evaluation and validation. Traditional evaluation metrics may not be sufficient when the data is sparse or when the model is making predictions about unmeasurable states. Therefore, alternative validation techniques, such as cross-validation, bootstrapping, and uncertainty quantification, are often used to assess the reliability of the model. These techniques help identify potential weaknesses in the model and provide insights into the confidence levels of the predictions. For example, in seismic hazard assessment, uncertainty quantification techniques such as Bayesian neural networks can be used to estimate the probability distribution of the model's predictions, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of the risks involved [170].

In conclusion, the integration of machine learning with physics-based models in earthquake engineering requires careful consideration of the challenges posed by unmeasurable states and sparse data. Techniques such as reduced loss terms, numerical integration, data augmentation, and transfer learning have been proposed to address these challenges and improve the accuracy and reliability of the models. By leveraging these methods, researchers can develop more robust and physically consistent predictions, even in data-scarce or unmeasurable scenarios. As the field continues to evolve, further research is needed to refine these techniques and explore new approaches for handling the complexities of real-world seismic and structural problems.

### 6.5 Application in Complex Physical Systems

The integration of machine learning with physics-based models has opened up new research directions in various fields, and the application of physics-informed models in complex physical systems is one such area. These systems, such as fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, and geophysical modeling, are inherently complex, involving multiple interacting variables and nonlinear relationships. Physics-informed models, which incorporate physical laws and domain knowledge into the learning process, have shown significant potential in improving the accuracy and efficiency of predictions in these complex systems. By leveraging the strengths of both machine learning and physics-based modeling, these models offer a more robust and reliable approach to simulating and predicting the behavior of complex physical systems.

In the context of fluid dynamics, physics-informed models have been applied to simulate and predict fluid flow, heat transfer, and other related phenomena. Traditional numerical simulations, while accurate, are often computationally expensive and time-consuming. Physics-informed machine learning models, on the other hand, can provide accurate predictions with significantly lower computational costs. For instance, the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has been shown to effectively solve partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern fluid flow, offering a promising alternative to traditional finite element and finite difference methods. These models not only capture the underlying physical laws but also enable the incorporation of real-world data, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions [10]. By integrating physical constraints into the training process, these models can extrapolate beyond the training data, making them suitable for a wide range of applications in fluid dynamics.

In structural mechanics, physics-informed models have been used to predict the response of structures to various loads and environmental conditions. These models incorporate the fundamental principles of mechanics, such as Newton's laws of motion and the equations of motion, to ensure that the predictions are physically consistent. For example, in the case of earthquake engineering, physics-informed machine learning models have been employed to predict the seismic response of structures, such as buildings and bridges. These models not only consider the structural properties but also incorporate the dynamic interactions between the structure and the ground motion. By combining the strengths of machine learning with the physical laws governing structural behavior, these models can provide more accurate and reliable predictions, which are essential for the design and assessment of earthquake-resistant structures [7].

Geophysical modeling is another area where physics-informed models have shown great promise. These models are used to simulate and predict the behavior of the Earth's subsurface, which is essential for various applications such as oil and gas exploration, carbon sequestration, and groundwater management. Traditional geophysical modeling techniques often rely on complex and computationally intensive numerical simulations, which can be challenging to implement in real-time applications. Physics-informed machine learning models, however, offer a more efficient and scalable solution. For instance, in the context of seismic imaging and inversion, physics-informed models have been used to reconstruct subsurface structures from seismic data. These models incorporate the governing equations of wave propagation and the principles of seismic reflection and refraction, leading to more accurate and reliable subsurface images [171]. By leveraging the power of machine learning, these models can process large volumes of seismic data efficiently, making them suitable for real-time applications.

The application of physics-informed models in complex physical systems also extends to the field of geothermal energy and carbon sequestration. In geothermal energy, these models are used to predict the behavior of geothermal reservoirs and optimize the extraction of heat. By incorporating the physical laws governing heat transfer and fluid flow, these models can provide accurate predictions of reservoir performance, which is essential for the design and operation of geothermal systems. Similarly, in carbon sequestration, physics-informed models are used to predict the behavior of CO₂ plumes in the subsurface, ensuring that the injected CO₂ remains trapped and does not migrate to the surface. These models incorporate the physical principles of fluid dynamics and geochemistry, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions of CO₂ behavior [10].

Another important application of physics-informed models is in the field of earthquake engineering, where they are used to predict the behavior of faults and the associated seismic activity. Traditional earthquake prediction methods are often based on empirical models and statistical analyses, which can be limited in their ability to capture the complex physical processes involved. Physics-informed machine learning models, on the other hand, incorporate the physical laws governing fault mechanics and seismic wave propagation, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions. For example, in the study of fault zone dynamics, physics-informed models have been used to predict the evolution of stress and strain in the fault zone, which is essential for understanding the mechanisms of earthquake nucleation and propagation [10]. By integrating the principles of mechanics and geophysics into the learning process, these models can provide valuable insights into the behavior of faults and the associated seismic hazards.

In addition to these applications, physics-informed models have also been used in the field of environmental monitoring and hazard assessment. These models are used to predict the impact of natural disasters, such as earthquakes and landslides, on the environment and infrastructure. By incorporating the physical laws governing these processes, these models can provide accurate predictions of the potential damage and risks, which is essential for the development of effective mitigation strategies. For example, in the context of landslide prediction, physics-informed models have been used to simulate the movement of soil and rock, taking into account the physical properties of the materials and the environmental conditions [10]. These models can provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to landslide initiation and propagation, helping to inform the development of early warning systems and mitigation measures.

Overall, the application of physics-informed models in complex physical systems has demonstrated significant potential in improving the accuracy and efficiency of predictions. By integrating the principles of physics and the power of machine learning, these models offer a more robust and reliable approach to simulating and predicting the behavior of complex systems. As the field continues to evolve, the development of more sophisticated and efficient physics-informed models will play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of complex physical systems and their applications in various domains.

### 6.6 Hybrid AI-Physical Models

Hybrid AI-physical models represent a powerful synergy between machine learning (ML) and traditional physics-based simulations, aiming to leverage the strengths of both paradigms for more accurate and robust predictions in earthquake engineering. These models integrate the data-driven flexibility of ML with the physical consistency and interpretability of physics-based models, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of complex seismic phenomena. By combining the predictive capabilities of ML with the fundamental laws of physics, hybrid models offer a promising approach to address the limitations of both purely data-driven and physics-based methods.

One of the key advantages of hybrid AI-physical models is their ability to incorporate physical constraints into the training process, ensuring that the models adhere to known physical laws while still being able to capture complex patterns in the data. This is particularly important in earthquake engineering, where the underlying physical processes are governed by well-established principles of mechanics, seismology, and geophysics. By embedding these physical constraints into the model architecture, hybrid models can provide more reliable predictions, especially in scenarios where the available data is sparse or noisy.

A notable example of a hybrid AI-physical model is the physics-informed neural network (PINN), which integrates the governing equations of physics into the loss function of a neural network. This approach ensures that the model's predictions are not only statistically accurate but also physically consistent [7]. PINNs have been successfully applied in various domains, including seismic response prediction, where they have demonstrated improved accuracy and robustness compared to purely data-driven models. By explicitly incorporating the equations of motion and other physical laws into the training process, PINNs can effectively capture the nonlinear behavior of structures under seismic loading, leading to more reliable predictions of their response.

Another important aspect of hybrid AI-physical models is their ability to improve the generalization capabilities of machine learning models. Traditional physics-based simulations often require extensive computational resources and are limited by their reliance on simplifying assumptions. On the other hand, data-driven ML models can struggle with out-of-distribution performance, especially when the training data does not adequately represent the real-world scenarios. Hybrid models address this challenge by combining the interpretability of physics-based models with the adaptability of ML, enabling them to generalize better across different conditions and datasets. This is particularly beneficial in earthquake engineering, where the variability of seismic events and the complexity of the subsurface structure make it difficult to rely solely on either approach.

The integration of ML with physics-based simulations also offers new opportunities for real-time monitoring and decision-making in earthquake engineering. For instance, hybrid models can be used to enhance the accuracy of earthquake early warning systems by combining the predictive power of ML with the physical insights provided by traditional simulations. This approach allows for faster and more reliable detection of seismic events, enabling timely warnings and emergency responses. The application of hybrid models in this context has been explored in several studies, demonstrating their potential to improve the performance of early warning systems [104].

In addition to improving the accuracy and robustness of predictions, hybrid AI-physical models can also enhance the interpretability of machine learning results. One of the major challenges in applying ML to earthquake engineering is the "black-box" nature of many deep learning models, which makes it difficult to understand how they arrive at their predictions. Hybrid models address this issue by incorporating physical insights into the decision-making process, providing a clearer understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This is particularly important in critical applications such as structural health monitoring and risk assessment, where the reliability of predictions is crucial for informed decision-making [7].

Moreover, hybrid models can help bridge the gap between data-driven approaches and the domain-specific knowledge of earthquake engineers. Traditional physics-based simulations are often developed by experts who have deep knowledge of the underlying physical processes, while data-driven ML models are typically trained on large datasets without explicit consideration of these physical constraints. By integrating these two perspectives, hybrid models can leverage the strengths of both approaches, leading to more accurate and interpretable results. This is particularly relevant in the context of seismic imaging and inversion, where the integration of ML with physics-based methods has been shown to significantly improve the quality of subsurface reconstructions [7].

The development of hybrid AI-physical models also opens up new possibilities for uncertainty quantification and risk assessment in earthquake engineering. Traditional physics-based models often struggle with quantifying uncertainties, as they rely on deterministic equations that do not account for the inherent variability in seismic events. In contrast, ML models can provide probabilistic predictions, but they may lack the physical consistency required for reliable risk assessments. Hybrid models address this challenge by combining the probabilistic outputs of ML with the physical constraints of physics-based simulations, leading to more accurate and reliable uncertainty estimates. This is particularly important for applications such as earthquake risk assessment, where the ability to quantify uncertainties is critical for effective disaster management and response planning [7].

Furthermore, hybrid models can help address the issue of data scarcity in earthquake engineering. The availability of high-quality seismic data is often limited, especially in regions with low seismic activity or where data collection is challenging. Hybrid models mitigate this issue by leveraging the knowledge embedded in physics-based simulations, allowing them to make more accurate predictions even with limited data. This is particularly beneficial in applications such as seismic monitoring and structural health assessment, where the availability of data is often a major constraint [7].

In conclusion, hybrid AI-physical models represent a promising approach for enhancing the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of machine learning in earthquake engineering. By integrating the strengths of ML with the physical consistency of physics-based simulations, these models offer a powerful tool for addressing the complex challenges of seismic prediction, monitoring, and risk assessment. The successful application of hybrid models in various domains, as demonstrated in the literature, highlights their potential to revolutionize the field of earthquake engineering and improve the resilience of critical infrastructure. As research in this area continues to advance, the development of more sophisticated and efficient hybrid models will play a crucial role in shaping the future of earthquake engineering.

### 6.7 Physics-Informed Digital Twins

Physics-informed digital twins represent a significant advancement in the integration of machine learning with physics-based models, offering a powerful framework for real-time monitoring and control of complex systems. A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical system that leverages real-time data to simulate and predict the behavior of its physical counterpart. When augmented with physics-informed models, these digital twins ensure physical consistency and predictive accuracy, which is crucial for applications in earthquake engineering. By embedding physical laws and domain knowledge into the learning process, physics-informed digital twins can provide more reliable and interpretable predictions, addressing some of the limitations of purely data-driven approaches.

One of the key advantages of physics-informed digital twins is their ability to incorporate governing equations of motion, material properties, and other physical constraints directly into the model. This integration ensures that the predictions made by the digital twin are not only data-driven but also grounded in the fundamental principles of physics. For instance, in the context of earthquake monitoring, a physics-informed digital twin can simulate the seismic response of structures by incorporating the equations of motion and the mechanical properties of the materials involved. This approach not only improves the accuracy of predictions but also enhances the interpretability of the results, making it easier for engineers and researchers to understand and trust the model's outputs.

The use of physics-informed models in digital twins has been explored in various studies, with promising results. For example, the paper "Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction" [10] discusses the development of a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that integrates the physics of fault friction into the learning process. This PINN not only predicts the behavior of fault systems but also ensures that the model's outputs are consistent with the underlying physical laws. The application of such models to digital twins can significantly enhance their predictive capabilities, making them more suitable for real-time monitoring and control applications.

Another important aspect of physics-informed digital twins is their ability to handle sparse and noisy data. Traditional data-driven models often struggle with data scarcity, which can lead to overfitting and poor generalization. By incorporating physical constraints, physics-informed models can mitigate these issues, as the physical laws act as a form of regularization that guides the learning process. For example, the paper "Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Data-Driven Seismic Response Modeling" [92] introduces a physics-informed convolutional neural network (PhyCNN) that leverages the laws of dynamics to improve the robustness of the model. This approach not only reduces the need for large training datasets but also enhances the model's ability to generalize to unseen data, making it more suitable for real-world applications.

Real-time monitoring and control are critical components of earthquake engineering, and physics-informed digital twins offer a robust solution for these tasks. By continuously updating the digital twin with real-time data from the physical system, engineers can monitor the system's behavior and make informed decisions. This is particularly important in the context of seismic events, where timely and accurate information can significantly impact the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. For example, the paper "SeisT: A foundational deep learning model for earthquake monitoring tasks" [15] introduces a deep learning model that combines multiple modules tailored to different tasks, demonstrating impressive out-of-distribution generalization performance. This model can be integrated into a digital twin framework to provide real-time insights into the seismic response of structures.

The integration of physics-informed models into digital twins also addresses the challenge of model validation and verification. Traditional data-driven models often lack transparency, making it difficult to assess their reliability. Physics-informed models, on the other hand, provide a clear framework for validating the model's outputs against known physical laws. This is particularly important in the context of earthquake engineering, where the consequences of model inaccuracies can be severe. The paper "Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction" [10] highlights the importance of incorporating physical constraints into the learning process, ensuring that the model's predictions are not only accurate but also physically meaningful.

In addition to improving the accuracy and reliability of predictions, physics-informed digital twins also offer the potential for more efficient and cost-effective monitoring and control. By leveraging the power of machine learning, these digital twins can process large volumes of data in real-time, enabling quick decision-making. This is particularly beneficial in the context of seismic monitoring, where the ability to detect and respond to events in real-time can significantly reduce the risk of damage and loss of life. For example, the paper "Real-time Earthquake Early Warning with Deep Learning" [5] describes a deep learning-based system that can reliably determine earthquake locations and magnitudes within seconds of the first triggered station. This system can be integrated into a digital twin framework to provide real-time insights into seismic activity, enhancing the effectiveness of early warning systems.

Furthermore, physics-informed digital twins can be used to optimize the design and operation of complex systems. By simulating the behavior of the system under different conditions, engineers can identify potential issues and make informed decisions to improve performance. This is particularly relevant in the context of structural health monitoring, where the ability to predict and mitigate damage is crucial for ensuring the safety and longevity of infrastructure. The paper "Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Data-Driven Seismic Response Modeling" [92] demonstrates how physics-informed models can be used to predict the seismic response of buildings, providing valuable insights for structural design and maintenance.

In conclusion, physics-informed digital twins represent a transformative approach to the integration of machine learning with physics-based models in earthquake engineering. By incorporating physical laws and domain knowledge into the learning process, these digital twins ensure physical consistency and predictive accuracy, addressing some of the limitations of purely data-driven approaches. The applications of physics-informed digital twins in real-time monitoring, control, and optimization highlight their potential to revolutionize the field of earthquake engineering, offering a powerful tool for improving the safety and resilience of critical infrastructure.

### 6.8 Challenges in Training Physics-Informed Models

Training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) presents significant challenges, particularly in the areas of loss landscape optimization, convergence issues, and the delicate balance between data-driven learning and the imposition of physical constraints. These challenges are not merely technical hurdles but represent fundamental obstacles to the effective deployment of PINNs in real-world applications, particularly in the complex and dynamic domain of earthquake engineering.

One of the primary challenges in training physics-informed models is the optimization of the loss landscape. Unlike conventional neural networks that are trained exclusively on data, PINNs integrate physical laws and domain knowledge into their training process, often through the incorporation of governing equations into the loss function. This dual objective—fitting the data and satisfying the physical constraints—leads to a more complex loss landscape. The optimization process becomes highly non-convex, with multiple local minima and saddle points, making it challenging to find a global minimum that balances both data fidelity and physical consistency. Recent studies have shown that the choice of optimizer, learning rate, and regularization techniques significantly impacts the performance and stability of PINN training [172]. Furthermore, the integration of physics into the loss function can introduce additional complexity, as the model must navigate a high-dimensional space where the trade-off between data and physics is not always clear. For instance, in the context of seismic inversion, the physical constraints may dominate the loss function, leading to overfitting or underfitting depending on the relative weights assigned to the data and physics terms [171].

Another significant challenge is the convergence of PINNs during training. The presence of multiple constraints, such as initial conditions, boundary conditions, and physical laws, can lead to slow or even non-convergent training processes. Convergence issues are particularly pronounced when the physical constraints are not easily satisfied by the neural network's predictions, resulting in high loss values that hinder the learning process. This is often exacerbated by the fact that the data used to train PINNs may be sparse or noisy, which further complicates the learning process. For example, in structural health monitoring, the data collected from sensors may not be sufficient to fully capture the dynamic behavior of the structure, leading to models that struggle to converge to a stable solution [38]. Moreover, the interplay between the data and the physical constraints can create a situation where the model oscillates between different states without reaching a stable solution, a phenomenon known as "training instability" [37].

A critical issue in the training of PINNs is the trade-off between data and physical constraints. While the inclusion of physics in the training process enhances the model's ability to generalize and predict accurately, it also introduces additional constraints that may conflict with the data. This trade-off is particularly challenging in scenarios where the data is limited or of poor quality, as the model may prioritize satisfying the physical constraints over fitting the data, leading to suboptimal performance. Conversely, if the data is too dominant, the model may fail to incorporate the necessary physical knowledge, resulting in predictions that are statistically accurate but physically inconsistent. This trade-off is a central challenge in the application of PINNs to earthquake engineering, where the data is often sparse and the physical laws governing seismic events are highly complex [146]. For instance, in the context of seismic imaging, the data may not provide sufficient information to fully capture the subsurface structure, forcing the model to rely heavily on the physical constraints to generate plausible predictions [171]. However, this reliance can lead to overfitting, where the model produces predictions that are consistent with the physical laws but do not accurately represent the true subsurface conditions.

The challenges of training physics-informed models are further compounded by the need for efficient and scalable algorithms. The training of PINNs can be computationally intensive, particularly when dealing with large-scale problems and high-dimensional data. This computational burden is exacerbated by the need to enforce physical constraints at every step of the training process, which can significantly increase the training time and resource requirements. For example, in the case of multi-physics problems, the model must simultaneously satisfy multiple physical laws, leading to a more complex and resource-intensive training process [172]. Furthermore, the use of advanced optimization techniques, such as second-order methods, can improve the convergence of PINNs but at the cost of increased computational complexity.

In addition to these technical challenges, there are also practical considerations that must be addressed when training physics-informed models. The integration of physics into the training process requires a deep understanding of the underlying physical laws and their mathematical formulations. This can be a significant barrier for practitioners who may not have the necessary expertise in the relevant physical domains. Moreover, the implementation of physics-informed models often requires specialized software and libraries that can handle the integration of physical constraints into the neural network training process [172]. This can further limit the adoption of PINNs in real-world applications, particularly in domains where the availability of such tools is limited.

In conclusion, the training of physics-informed neural networks presents a series of complex challenges, including loss landscape optimization, convergence issues, and the trade-off between data and physical constraints. These challenges are not only technical in nature but also have significant implications for the practical application of PINNs in earthquake engineering. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach that combines advances in machine learning, optimization, and physics-based modeling. By overcoming these obstacles, PINNs have the potential to revolutionize the field of earthquake engineering, enabling more accurate and reliable predictions of seismic events and their impacts.

### 6.9 Enhancing Model Generalization and Robustness

Enhancing the generalization and robustness of physics-informed models is a critical challenge in the integration of machine learning with physics-based models. While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in capturing the underlying physical laws, their performance can be limited by issues such as overfitting, sensitivity to noisy data, and poor generalization to unseen scenarios. To address these limitations, researchers have explored various techniques, including curriculum regularization, transfer learning, and the use of hard constraints, which aim to improve the models' ability to generalize and remain robust in complex and data-scarce environments. These methods not only enhance the predictive accuracy of the models but also ensure that they adhere to the physical laws that govern the system under study.

Curriculum regularization is one approach that has been successfully applied to improve the generalization and robustness of physics-informed models. This technique involves progressively increasing the complexity of the training data and the physical constraints that the model must satisfy. By starting with simpler problems and gradually introducing more complex scenarios, the model can learn to generalize better and avoid getting stuck in local minima during training. This method is particularly useful in cases where the model is prone to overfitting due to the presence of noise or sparse data. For example, in the context of physics-informed neural networks, curriculum regularization can be implemented by starting with a simplified version of the governing equations and gradually incorporating more complex terms as the training progresses. This approach has been shown to significantly improve the model's ability to generalize to new and unseen data, as demonstrated in studies that have applied this technique to problems involving fluid dynamics and heat transfer [173].

Transfer learning is another powerful strategy that can be used to enhance the generalization and robustness of physics-informed models. This technique involves pre-training a model on a related task or dataset and then fine-tuning it on the target problem. In the context of physics-informed models, transfer learning can be particularly effective when there is a lack of labeled data for the target problem. By leveraging knowledge from related domains, the model can learn to generalize better and adapt to new scenarios with minimal additional training. For instance, in the study of fluid dynamics, transfer learning has been used to pre-train a physics-informed neural network on a high-fidelity dataset and then fine-tune it on a lower-fidelity dataset, resulting in significant improvements in predictive accuracy and robustness [174]. This approach not only reduces the need for extensive labeled data but also helps the model to better capture the underlying physical laws, even in the presence of noise or incomplete data.

The use of hard constraints is another important method for enhancing the generalization and robustness of physics-informed models. Unlike soft constraints, which are typically implemented as penalty terms in the loss function, hard constraints are enforced explicitly during the training process. This ensures that the model's predictions strictly adhere to the physical laws that govern the system. For example, in the context of physics-informed neural networks, hard constraints can be implemented by incorporating the governing equations directly into the network's architecture or by using projection layers that enforce the constraints during the training process [47]. By explicitly enforcing these constraints, the model is less likely to produce physically inconsistent predictions, which is a common issue in data-driven models. This approach has been shown to significantly improve the model's robustness and generalization capabilities, particularly in scenarios where the data is noisy or sparse [175].

In addition to these methods, researchers have also explored the use of ensemble learning and model averaging to improve the generalization and robustness of physics-informed models. Ensemble learning involves training multiple models and combining their predictions to improve overall performance. This approach can be particularly effective in scenarios where the data is noisy or the underlying physical laws are not well understood. By averaging the predictions of multiple models, the ensemble can reduce the impact of individual model errors and improve the overall accuracy and reliability of the predictions. For example, in the study of seismic imaging, ensemble learning has been used to combine the predictions of multiple physics-informed models, resulting in significant improvements in the accuracy and robustness of the final predictions [176].

Another promising approach to enhancing the generalization and robustness of physics-informed models is the use of physics-informed regularization techniques. These techniques involve incorporating additional constraints into the loss function to guide the model's learning process and improve its ability to generalize to new scenarios. For example, in the context of physics-informed neural networks, physics-informed regularization can be implemented by adding terms to the loss function that enforce the conservation of energy or other physical quantities. This approach has been shown to significantly improve the model's ability to generalize to new scenarios and reduce the risk of overfitting, particularly when the data is sparse or noisy [177].

In conclusion, enhancing the generalization and robustness of physics-informed models is a critical area of research that has significant implications for the integration of machine learning with physics-based models. By leveraging techniques such as curriculum regularization, transfer learning, hard constraints, ensemble learning, and physics-informed regularization, researchers can improve the models' ability to generalize to new scenarios and remain robust in complex and data-scarce environments. These methods not only enhance the predictive accuracy of the models but also ensure that they adhere to the physical laws that govern the system under study. As the field continues to evolve, further research is needed to develop more effective and efficient strategies for improving the generalization and robustness of physics-informed models, particularly in the context of complex and high-dimensional problems.

### 6.10 Real-World Applications in Earthquake Engineering

The integration of machine learning with physics-based models has yielded significant real-world applications in earthquake engineering, particularly in seismic imaging, structural health monitoring, and risk assessment. These applications not only demonstrate the practical benefits of physics-informed models but also highlight their potential to revolutionize how we understand and mitigate seismic risks. One of the most notable real-world applications is in seismic imaging, where physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been used to reconstruct subsurface structures from seismic data with high accuracy and resolution [10]. By embedding the governing equations of wave propagation into the training process, these models ensure that the predictions align with physical laws, thus improving the reliability of the results. This approach has been particularly useful in regions with complex geology, where traditional methods often struggle to produce accurate images of the subsurface.

In the realm of structural health monitoring, physics-informed models have enabled more accurate and reliable assessment of damage in critical infrastructure. For instance, the use of physics-guided convolutional neural networks (PhyCNN) has allowed for the data-driven modeling of seismic responses of buildings without the need for extensive physics-based simulations [79]. This model incorporates the laws of dynamics as constraints during training, which not only improves the robustness of the predictions but also reduces the reliance on large training datasets. This approach has been successfully applied to real-world scenarios, including the assessment of buildings subjected to earthquake loads. By integrating domain-specific knowledge, these models offer a more interpretable and reliable alternative to purely data-driven approaches, which are often criticized for their black-box nature.

Risk assessment is another area where physics-informed models have made significant contributions. For example, the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) has enabled the synthesis of realistic seismic data, which can be used to train models for risk assessment and prediction [131]. This capability is particularly valuable in regions with limited historical seismic data, where traditional methods may not be effective. Additionally, the integration of physics-based models with machine learning has allowed for more accurate estimation of earthquake impacts, including the prediction of ground motion and the identification of vulnerable structures. This has been demonstrated in various real-world applications, including the assessment of building vulnerability in urban areas and the development of early warning systems [106].

One of the most compelling real-world applications of physics-informed models is in the development of digital twins for real-time monitoring and control of complex systems [178]. These digital twins integrate physical models with machine learning to provide accurate and up-to-date representations of the real-world system. In the context of earthquake engineering, this approach has been used to monitor the structural integrity of bridges and buildings in real-time. By continuously updating the digital twin with new data from sensors and other sources, engineers can detect early signs of damage and take preventive measures. This has been particularly useful in regions prone to frequent seismic activity, where the ability to monitor structures in real-time can significantly enhance safety and resilience [178].

Another significant application of physics-informed models is in the prediction of earthquake-induced damage using satellite imagery and remote sensing data [120]. For instance, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has enabled the automated detection of building damage in satellite images, which is crucial for rapid response and relief efforts [148]. These models have been trained on large datasets of satellite images and have demonstrated high accuracy in identifying damaged structures. This approach has been applied in various real-world scenarios, including post-earthquake damage assessments in regions affected by major seismic events. By providing timely and accurate information about the extent of damage, these models support more effective disaster response and recovery efforts.

The application of physics-informed models in earthquake engineering has also extended to the development of real-time early warning systems. For example, the use of generalized neural networks has enabled the rapid detection of earthquakes and the estimation of their parameters, such as location and magnitude [22]. These models are trained on data from multiple regions and are capable of generalizing to new and unseen seismic events. This has been particularly valuable in regions with limited seismic monitoring infrastructure, where traditional methods may not be effective. The ability to provide early warnings can significantly reduce the impact of earthquakes by allowing people and infrastructure to take protective measures before the shaking begins.

In addition to these applications, physics-informed models have also been used to improve the accuracy of seismic hazard assessments. For example, the integration of physics-based models with machine learning has allowed for the more accurate estimation of ground motion parameters, which are critical for the design of earthquake-resistant structures [7]. This approach has been applied in various real-world scenarios, including the assessment of seismic risks in urban areas and the development of building codes. By incorporating physical constraints into the training process, these models ensure that the predictions are consistent with the underlying physics, thus improving the reliability of the results.

Overall, the real-world applications of physics-informed models in earthquake engineering demonstrate their potential to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of seismic monitoring, prediction, and risk assessment. These models offer a powerful tool for addressing the complex challenges associated with earthquakes, from the reconstruction of subsurface structures to the assessment of building vulnerability and the development of early warning systems. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of machine learning with physics-based models is expected to play an increasingly important role in advancing our understanding and mitigation of seismic risks.

### 6.11 Future Directions and Research Opportunities

The integration of physics-based equations within the deep learning framework is an emerging research direction that could significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of earthquake engineering models [61]. By embedding physical laws into the neural network architecture, models can be constrained to adhere to the principles of physics, thereby improving their predictive power and interpretability. This approach not only ensures that the models are physically consistent but also allows them to generalize better to unseen data. For instance, in the context of seismic imaging, physics-informed models can be trained to respect the underlying physical laws, leading to more accurate subsurface structure reconstructions [61].

Another promising research direction is the development of more efficient algorithms for training physics-informed models. Current approaches often require substantial computational resources, which can be a barrier to their widespread adoption. By leveraging techniques such as model compression and pruning, researchers can reduce the computational complexity of these models while maintaining their performance. Additionally, the use of quantization and other optimization strategies can further enhance the efficiency of these models, making them more suitable for real-time applications [179]. Future research could focus on creating novel algorithms that balance computational efficiency with the need for physical consistency.

The integration of multi-physics systems presents another exciting avenue for future research. Earthquake engineering involves a complex interplay of various physical phenomena, including seismic waves, soil dynamics, and structural responses. Physics-informed models can be designed to incorporate multiple physical processes simultaneously, leading to more comprehensive and accurate predictions. For example, in the context of structural health monitoring, models can be developed to account for both the mechanical behavior of structures and the environmental factors that influence their performance [61]. This holistic approach would enable engineers to better understand the interactions between different physical systems and make more informed decisions.

Exploring novel architectures for improved performance is also a critical research direction. Traditional neural network architectures may not be well-suited for capturing the complex relationships inherent in earthquake engineering problems. Future research could focus on developing specialized architectures that are tailored to the specific challenges of this domain. For instance, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in capturing the spatial relationships between different components of a structure, making them a viable option for structural health monitoring [26]. Additionally, hybrid models that combine the strengths of different architectures could be explored to achieve better performance and robustness.

Another area of future research is the improvement of data scarcity and quality issues. The availability of high-quality, labeled data is a significant challenge in earthquake engineering, as seismic events are rare and data collection is often expensive. Physics-informed models can help mitigate this issue by incorporating domain knowledge and physical constraints, reducing the reliance on large amounts of labeled data [61]. Future work could focus on developing more effective data augmentation techniques and leveraging synthetic data to enhance the training of these models [180].

The development of explainable and interpretable physics-informed models is also an important research direction. While deep learning models have achieved impressive performance, their black-box nature can hinder their adoption in critical applications. By incorporating explainability mechanisms, such as attention maps and feature importance analysis, researchers can make these models more transparent and trustworthy [59]. Future work could focus on creating models that not only make accurate predictions but also provide clear insights into the underlying physical processes.

The integration of physics-informed models with real-time data processing is another area that warrants further investigation. The ability to process and analyze seismic data in real-time is crucial for early warning systems and disaster response. Future research could focus on developing efficient algorithms that can handle large volumes of data with minimal latency, ensuring timely and accurate predictions [181]. This would require advancements in both algorithm design and hardware capabilities to support real-time applications.

Moreover, the exploration of transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques could significantly enhance the generalizability of physics-informed models. These techniques can help models trained on one seismic region adapt to different geological conditions and datasets, improving their performance in diverse environments [151]. Future research could focus on developing more effective transfer learning strategies that leverage the strengths of physics-informed models while addressing the challenges of domain shifts and data scarcity.

Finally, the ethical and societal implications of using physics-informed models in earthquake engineering must be carefully considered. The deployment of these models in real-world applications requires a thorough understanding of their potential impacts on communities and the environment. Future research should address the ethical challenges associated with the use of these models, ensuring that they are developed and deployed in a responsible and equitable manner [182]. This includes addressing issues of data privacy, bias, and transparency to build trust and ensure the fair and effective use of these models.

In conclusion, the future of physics-informed models in earthquake engineering holds great promise. By addressing the challenges of computational efficiency, multi-physics integration, and model interpretability, researchers can develop more accurate, reliable, and robust models. These advancements will not only enhance the predictive capabilities of earthquake engineering systems but also contribute to the broader goal of improving public safety and disaster resilience.

## 7 Applications in Seismic Imaging, Inversion, and Geophysical Modeling

### 7.1 Seismic Imaging with Deep Learning

Seismic hazards pose a significant risk to public safety, infrastructure, and the economy, particularly in regions with high seismic activity. The integration of machine learning (ML) techniques in seismic imaging, inversion, and geophysical modeling has opened new frontiers in earthquake engineering, offering enhanced accuracy, resolution, and efficiency in understanding subsurface structures and predicting seismic events. Deep learning, a subset of ML, has emerged as a powerful tool for seismic imaging, enabling the reconstruction of subsurface structures from seismic data with remarkable precision. This subsection explores the application of deep learning techniques in seismic imaging, focusing on their role in improving resolution and accuracy.

Seismic imaging involves the reconstruction of subsurface structures using seismic data, such as reflections and refractions of seismic waves. Traditional methods, such as seismic tomography and full waveform inversion, have been widely used for this purpose. However, these methods often face challenges in terms of computational cost, resolution, and the ability to handle complex geological structures. Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), have shown great promise in addressing these limitations.

One of the key advantages of deep learning in seismic imaging is its ability to learn complex patterns and relationships from large datasets. For instance, the paper titled "Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Seismic Response Evaluation of Nonlinear Systems" highlights the potential of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in capturing the underlying physical laws that govern seismic wave propagation. These networks can be trained to incorporate physical constraints, such as the laws of motion and energy conservation, into the learning process, leading to more accurate and reliable models of subsurface structures [92].

Another significant contribution is the paper "Deep Learning for Laboratory Earthquake Prediction and Autoregressive Forecasting of Fault Zone Stress," which discusses the use of deep learning models to predict seismic events and analyze fault zone stress. The authors demonstrate that deep learning techniques, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, can effectively capture temporal dependencies in seismic data, enabling the prediction of seismic events with high accuracy. These models can also be used to reconstruct subsurface structures by analyzing the spatial and temporal characteristics of seismic waves [20].

The paper "Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Seismic Response Prediction of Nonlinear Steel Moment Resisting Frame Structures" further illustrates the application of deep learning in seismic imaging by integrating scientific principles into the model training process. The authors propose a physics-informed machine learning (PiML) method that incorporates physical laws, such as Newton's second law, into deep neural networks. This approach not only enhances the accuracy of the models but also ensures that the predictions are physically meaningful, making them more reliable for seismic imaging tasks [7].

In addition to traditional deep learning models, generative models, such as GANs, have also been explored for seismic imaging. The paper "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Seismic Data Generation and Enhancement" discusses the use of GANs to synthesize seismic data, which can be used to augment training datasets and improve the generalization capabilities of deep learning models. By generating realistic seismic data, GANs help address the issue of data scarcity, which is a common challenge in seismic imaging [163].

Moreover, the paper "Machine Learning based Surrogate Modeling with SVD Enabled Training for Nonlinear Civil Structures Subject to Dynamic Loading" highlights the use of singular value decomposition (SVD) to enhance the training of deep learning models for seismic imaging. The authors propose a surrogate modeling framework that leverages SVD to generate a variety of earthquakes by randomly sampling the weights of a representative ground motion suite. This approach enables the creation of diverse seismic datasets, which can be used to train deep learning models for more accurate and robust seismic imaging [166].

The application of deep learning in seismic imaging is not limited to the reconstruction of subsurface structures; it also extends to the prediction of seismic events and the analysis of fault zone stress. The paper "Real-time Earthquake Early Warning with Deep Learning: Application to the 2016 Central Apennines, Italy Earthquake Sequence" presents a deep learning-based early warning system that utilizes fully convolutional networks to detect earthquakes and estimate their source parameters from continuous seismic waveform streams. The system can determine earthquake locations and magnitudes as soon as one station receives earthquake signals, providing timely warnings to mitigate seismic hazards [5].

In summary, the integration of deep learning techniques in seismic imaging has revolutionized the way we reconstruct subsurface structures and predict seismic events. These techniques offer improved resolution, accuracy, and efficiency, making them invaluable tools in earthquake engineering. By leveraging the power of deep learning, researchers can gain deeper insights into seismic processes and develop more effective strategies for mitigating seismic risks. As the field continues to evolve, the application of deep learning in seismic imaging is expected to play an increasingly important role in ensuring the safety and resilience of infrastructure in seismically active regions.

### 7.2 Waveform Inversion Using Machine Learning

Wavefield tomography is a geophysical method that provides a detailed understanding of subsurface structures by analyzing the propagation of seismic waves. This technique is particularly useful in complex geological settings where traditional methods may not be sufficient. By utilizing the principles of wave propagation, wavefield tomography can generate high-resolution images of the Earth's subsurface, which are essential for various applications such as oil and gas exploration, seismic hazard assessment, and environmental monitoring. The method involves the inversion of seismic data to estimate the velocity distribution of the subsurface, which is crucial for accurate imaging and interpretation [80].

The application of wavefield tomography in subsurface imaging is a well-established practice in the field of geophysics. It allows researchers to create detailed models of the Earth's interior, which can be used to identify potential hydrocarbon reservoirs, assess the stability of geological formations, and predict the behavior of seismic waves during earthquakes. The process involves the collection of seismic data from various sources, such as earthquakes, controlled explosions, or seismic surveys, and the subsequent processing and inversion of this data to produce a velocity model of the subsurface. This model can then be used to simulate the propagation of seismic waves and to understand the physical properties of the subsurface [80].

One of the key advantages of wavefield tomography is its ability to handle complex geological structures. Traditional methods, such as ray tracing, often struggle to accurately model the behavior of seismic waves in heterogeneous media. In contrast, wavefield tomography can account for the complexities of the subsurface by incorporating the full wave equation, which describes the propagation of seismic waves in a medium. This approach allows for a more accurate representation of the subsurface, which is essential for reliable imaging and interpretation. Additionally, wavefield tomography can be applied to both 2D and 3D data sets, providing a comprehensive view of the subsurface [80].

The use of wavefield tomography in subsurface imaging is not without its challenges. One of the primary difficulties is the computational complexity associated with solving the full wave equation. The inversion process requires significant computational resources and time, which can be a limiting factor in practical applications. To address this issue, researchers have developed various numerical methods and algorithms to improve the efficiency and accuracy of wavefield tomography. These methods include the use of finite difference, finite element, and spectral element techniques, which can be tailored to the specific characteristics of the subsurface [183].

Another challenge in wavefield tomography is the need for high-quality seismic data. The accuracy of the velocity model depends on the quality and quantity of the input data. In areas with limited seismic coverage or noisy data, the resulting velocity models may be less reliable. To overcome this limitation, researchers have explored the use of advanced data processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to enhance the quality of the seismic data. These approaches can help to reduce noise, improve signal-to-noise ratios, and extract meaningful information from the data, leading to more accurate velocity models [10].

The integration of machine learning techniques into wavefield tomography has emerged as a promising approach to address some of the challenges associated with traditional methods. Machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks and support vector machines, can be trained on large datasets of seismic data to identify patterns and relationships that are not easily discernible through conventional methods. These algorithms can be used to improve the accuracy of the velocity model by incorporating additional constraints and prior knowledge about the subsurface. For example, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can be employed to ensure that the velocity model adheres to the principles of wave propagation, thereby improving the physical consistency of the results [10].

In addition to enhancing the accuracy of the velocity model, machine learning can also be used to optimize the inversion process in wavefield tomography. By leveraging the power of machine learning, researchers can develop more efficient algorithms that can handle the computational demands of large-scale seismic data. This is particularly important in applications such as real-time monitoring and decision-making, where rapid processing of seismic data is essential. The use of machine learning can also help to reduce the computational burden by identifying the most relevant features of the seismic data, thereby improving the efficiency of the inversion process [10].

The application of wavefield tomography in subsurface imaging is also influenced by the availability of high-performance computing resources. The inversion process requires significant computational power, which can be a limiting factor in practical applications. To address this challenge, researchers have explored the use of parallel computing and cloud-based solutions to distribute the computational workload and improve the efficiency of the inversion process. These approaches can significantly reduce the time required to generate velocity models, making wavefield tomography more accessible and practical for a wide range of applications [183].

In conclusion, wavefield tomography is a powerful geophysical method that provides detailed insights into the subsurface by analyzing the propagation of seismic waves. The technique is essential for various applications, including oil and gas exploration, seismic hazard assessment, and environmental monitoring. Despite the challenges associated with the computational complexity and data quality, the integration of machine learning techniques and high-performance computing resources has the potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of wavefield tomography. As the field continues to evolve, the application of wavefield tomography in subsurface imaging will likely play an increasingly important role in understanding the Earth's subsurface and its potential for resource exploration and hazard assessment [80].

### 7.3 Geophysical Modeling with Neural Networks

Geophysical modeling is a critical aspect of earthquake engineering, where the goal is to understand and predict the behavior of the Earth's subsurface. Traditionally, geophysical modeling has relied on physics-based simulations, which are computationally intensive and often require a deep understanding of the underlying physical processes. However, the advent of deep learning has opened new avenues for simulating and predicting subsurface properties based on seismic data. Neural networks, particularly deep learning models, have shown great potential in this domain due to their ability to learn complex patterns and relationships from large datasets. This subsection explores the integration of neural networks in geophysical modeling, highlighting their role in simulating and predicting subsurface properties based on seismic data.

One of the key applications of neural networks in geophysical modeling is seismic inversion, which involves estimating subsurface properties such as velocity models from seismic data. Traditional seismic inversion methods often rely on iterative algorithms that can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning models in accelerating and improving the accuracy of seismic inversion. For example, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) has been applied to predict ground motion time series from a 3D geological description [169]. The FNO leverages the generalizability of its database to assess the influence of geological features such as sedimentary basins on ground motion, which is crucial for evaluating site effects. This approach has shown promising results in accurately predicting ground motion even when the underlying geology exhibits large heterogeneities.

In addition to seismic inversion, neural networks have been used to simulate and predict subsurface properties in various geophysical contexts. For instance, the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has been explored to incorporate physical laws and domain knowledge into the training of neural networks [10]. PINNs ensure that the model outcomes satisfy rigorous physical constraints, making them suitable for applications where physical consistency is essential. This approach has been applied to fault friction modeling, where the goal is to infer friction parameters during the training loop. The results demonstrate that PINNs can provide accurate and physically meaningful predictions, even when trained on limited data.

Another notable application of neural networks in geophysical modeling is the simulation of seismic wave propagation. Traditional methods for simulating seismic wave propagation often rely on solving partial differential equations, which can be computationally intensive. Deep learning models, such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have been shown to offer a more efficient alternative by learning the general solution of these equations with varying parameters [169]. This approach has been applied to predict ground motion time series from a 3D geological description, demonstrating the potential of deep learning to revolutionize seismic wave propagation simulations.

The integration of neural networks in geophysical modeling has also been explored in the context of subsurface imaging. Seismic imaging involves reconstructing the subsurface structure from seismic data, and deep learning models have shown promise in improving the resolution and accuracy of these images. For example, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been applied to seismic shot-gather image quality classification, where the goal is to identify and classify noisy or low-quality seismic data [86]. The results demonstrate that deep learning models can effectively identify and classify seismic data, leading to improved subsurface imaging.

In addition to improving the accuracy and efficiency of geophysical modeling, neural networks have also been used to handle the challenges of data scarcity and noise. For instance, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been employed to synthesize seismic data and enhance the training of machine learning models [28]. This approach has been shown to improve the detectability of earthquake events by augmenting the training dataset with synthetic samples. Similarly, autoencoder-based models have been used to reduce noise in seismic data, improving the quality of the input data for geophysical modeling [29]. These techniques have been instrumental in overcoming the limitations of traditional methods, which often struggle with noisy and incomplete data.

The integration of neural networks in geophysical modeling has also been explored in the context of real-time monitoring and prediction. For example, the use of deep learning models has been applied to real-time earthquake early warning systems, where the goal is to detect and predict earthquakes as quickly as possible [5]. These models have demonstrated the ability to accurately determine earthquake locations and magnitudes within seconds of the first triggered station, highlighting their potential for real-time applications.

Moreover, the use of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) techniques has been proposed to integrate domain knowledge into data-driven models, improving their generalization and interpretability [48]. PIML techniques combine the strengths of deep learning with the principles of physics, enabling the development of models that are both data-driven and physically consistent. This approach has been applied to various geophysical problems, including reservoir simulation and hydrocarbons production forecasting, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize the oil and gas industry and other emerging areas of interest.

In conclusion, the integration of neural networks in geophysical modeling has shown significant promise in simulating and predicting subsurface properties based on seismic data. From seismic inversion and wave propagation to subsurface imaging and real-time monitoring, deep learning models have demonstrated their ability to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of geophysical modeling. As the field continues to evolve, the continued development and application of neural networks in geophysical modeling will be crucial for addressing the complex challenges of earthquake engineering and seismology.

### 7.4 Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Seismic Inversion

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a significant advancement in the application of machine learning to geophysical modeling, particularly in seismic inversion. Unlike conventional neural networks, which rely solely on data-driven training, PINNs integrate physical laws and constraints directly into the network architecture. This approach ensures that the learned models not only fit the observed data but also adhere to the underlying physical principles governing seismic wave propagation, thereby enhancing model reliability and accuracy. In seismic inversion, where the goal is to infer subsurface properties from seismic data, PINNs offer a promising solution to address the challenges of ill-posed inverse problems and noisy data by embedding domain-specific knowledge into the learning process.

One of the key advantages of PINNs is their ability to incorporate governing equations, such as the wave equation or other physical laws, into the neural network's loss function. This ensures that the model's predictions are physically consistent, even when the training data is sparse or incomplete. For example, in seismic inversion, the wave equation describes the propagation of seismic waves through the Earth's subsurface. By embedding this equation into the neural network, PINNs can enforce physical constraints during training, leading to more accurate and reliable subsurface models. This is particularly important in regions with limited seismic data, where traditional data-driven models may struggle to generalize or produce physically meaningful results.

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of PINNs in seismic inversion. For instance, the paper "Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction" [10] introduces a PINN framework that integrates the physics of motion in the solid Earth to model fault friction parameters. This approach not only improves the accuracy of the model but also provides a more robust framework for understanding the complex dynamics of fault systems. Similarly, the work "SeismoGen: Seismic Waveform Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks" [28] highlights the potential of combining generative models with physics-informed constraints to synthesize realistic seismic data, which can be used to train and validate inversion algorithms.

In the context of seismic inversion, PINNs have been applied to improve the accuracy of subsurface velocity models, which are critical for understanding the Earth's internal structure. The paper "IntraSeismic: A coordinate-based learning approach to seismic inversion" [80] presents a hybrid seismic inversion method that seamlessly combines coordinate-based learning with the physics of the post-stack modeling operator. This approach leverages PINNs to incorporate physical constraints, leading to faster convergence rates and more accurate inversion results. Additionally, the paper "Encoder-Decoder Architecture for 3D Seismic Inversion" [82] demonstrates how a convolutional encoder-decoder architecture, enhanced with physics-informed constraints, can effectively reconstruct 3D geological models from noisy seismic data, achieving a high structural similarity index measure (SSIM).

Another critical aspect of PINNs in seismic inversion is their ability to handle the ill-posed nature of inverse problems. Seismic inversion is inherently ill-posed because the number of unknowns (subsurface properties) often exceeds the amount of available data, leading to multiple possible solutions. By embedding physical constraints, PINNs can regularize the inversion process and guide the model towards physically meaningful solutions. For example, the paper "Velocity continuation with Fourier neural operators for accelerated uncertainty quantification" [184] proposes a Fourier neural operator surrogate to map seismic images associated with one background model to another, effectively accelerating the inversion process while maintaining physical consistency.

The integration of PINNs with traditional seismic inversion techniques also opens up new possibilities for improving the accuracy of subsurface models. The paper "Merging Virtual and Real Environments for Visualizing Seismic Hazards and Risk" [81] discusses the use of PINNs in creating digital twins for real-time monitoring and control of complex systems. By incorporating physical laws into the neural network architecture, these models can provide more accurate and reliable predictions of seismic hazards, which is crucial for disaster management and risk assessment.

Moreover, PINNs can be used to quantify uncertainty in seismic inversion results, which is essential for making informed decisions in earthquake engineering and geophysical modeling. The paper "Uncertainty Quantification of Structural Systems with Subset of Data" [19] presents a method for quantifying uncertainty by leveraging a subset of data and incorporating a regression model trained on partial simulations. This approach, when combined with PINNs, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the uncertainties associated with subsurface models, enhancing the reliability of seismic inversion results.

In conclusion, the application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in seismic inversion offers a powerful and flexible framework for improving the accuracy and reliability of subsurface models. By embedding physical laws and constraints into the neural network architecture, PINNs ensure that the models not only fit the observed data but also adhere to the underlying physical principles. This approach has been successfully applied in various studies, demonstrating its potential to address the challenges of ill-posed inverse problems, noisy data, and sparse training data. As the field of machine learning in earthquake engineering continues to evolve, the integration of PINNs with traditional seismic inversion techniques will play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of the Earth's subsurface and improving seismic hazard assessment.

### 7.6 Data-Driven Seismic Inversion Techniques

### 7.6.1 Data-Driven Seismic Inversion Techniques

Data-driven seismic inversion techniques represent a paradigm shift in the field of geophysical modeling, moving away from traditional physics-based iterative algorithms to a more data-centric approach. These techniques leverage machine learning (ML) algorithms to directly map seismic data to subsurface properties, bypassing the need for complex and time-consuming physics-based modeling. This approach is particularly advantageous in scenarios where the underlying physical processes are not fully understood or are too complex to model accurately. By training ML models on large datasets of seismic data and corresponding subsurface properties, data-driven inversion techniques can learn intricate relationships and make accurate predictions without relying on explicit physical laws [62; 29].

One of the most significant benefits of data-driven seismic inversion is its ability to handle high-dimensional and non-linear data, which is common in seismic datasets. Traditional inversion methods often struggle with such complexity due to the limitations of their underlying mathematical formulations. In contrast, machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, are well-suited to capture and model these complex relationships. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been successfully applied to seismic inversion tasks, demonstrating superior performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to conventional methods [62; 29].

The application of data-driven inversion techniques is not limited to specific types of seismic data. These methods can be adapted to various data sources, including seismic traces, well logs, and geophysical measurements. This flexibility allows for the integration of multimodal data, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the inversion process. For instance, a study by [62] explored the use of CNNs to invert seismic data for subsurface velocity models, achieving high-resolution velocity reconstructions that outperformed traditional inversion methods. The study highlighted the effectiveness of deep learning in capturing the intricate relationships between seismic data and subsurface properties, even when the data is noisy or incomplete.

Another key advantage of data-driven seismic inversion is its potential to reduce the computational burden associated with traditional inversion techniques. Physics-based inversion methods often require extensive computational resources and time due to their reliance on iterative algorithms and the need to solve complex inverse problems. In contrast, data-driven methods can be trained offline on large datasets and then applied in real-time to new data, significantly reducing the computational overhead. This makes them particularly suitable for applications that require rapid and efficient processing, such as real-time monitoring and early warning systems [62; 29].

The integration of data-driven inversion techniques with other machine learning approaches, such as transfer learning and domain adaptation, further enhances their effectiveness. Transfer learning allows models trained on one dataset to be adapted to new datasets, reducing the need for extensive retraining and improving generalization. For example, [103] demonstrated how transfer learning can be used to improve the performance of seismic denoising models by leveraging pre-trained networks on synthetic data. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where labeled data is scarce, as it enables the model to generalize well to new and unseen data.

In addition to improving accuracy and efficiency, data-driven seismic inversion techniques also offer the potential for better uncertainty quantification. Traditional inversion methods often struggle with quantifying the uncertainty associated with their predictions, which can lead to overconfidence in the results. In contrast, machine learning models, particularly Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), can provide probabilistic outputs that capture the uncertainty in the predictions. This is crucial for applications such as risk assessment and decision-making, where the reliability of the predictions is of utmost importance. [186] highlighted the importance of quantifying both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in seismic inversion, emphasizing the need for robust and reliable models that can handle the inherent variability in seismic data.

The adoption of data-driven seismic inversion techniques also opens up new possibilities for the integration of domain knowledge and physical constraints. While these methods are primarily data-driven, they can be enhanced by incorporating physical principles and domain-specific knowledge. For instance, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been proposed to ensure that the models adhere to the underlying physical laws and constraints. This approach not only improves the accuracy of the predictions but also enhances the interpretability of the models, making them more trustworthy for practical applications [7; 48].

Despite the many advantages of data-driven seismic inversion techniques, there are also several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the primary challenges is the availability and quality of training data. Seismic data is often sparse, noisy, and incomplete, which can affect the performance of the models. To overcome this, researchers have explored various data augmentation techniques, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), to synthesize additional training data. [123] demonstrated the effectiveness of GANs in generating synthetic seismic data, which can be used to augment the training dataset and improve the robustness of the models.

Another challenge is the interpretability of the models. While deep learning models are highly effective at capturing complex relationships, they are often considered "black boxes" due to their lack of transparency. This can be a significant barrier to their adoption in critical applications, where understanding the reasoning behind the predictions is essential. To address this, researchers have developed various techniques to improve the interpretability of deep learning models, such as attention mechanisms and Grad-CAM. [124] showed how explainable AI can be used to gain insights into the inner workings of the models, providing a clearer understanding of how the predictions are made.

In conclusion, data-driven seismic inversion techniques represent a promising approach to geophysical modeling, offering significant advantages over traditional physics-based methods. By leveraging machine learning algorithms to directly map seismic data to subsurface properties, these techniques can improve the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of seismic inversion. However, the successful application of these methods requires addressing challenges related to data quality, model interpretability, and the integration of domain knowledge. As the field continues to evolve, the development of more robust and interpretable data-driven inversion techniques will be crucial for advancing our understanding of the subsurface and supporting a wide range of geophysical applications.

### 7.7 Real-Time and Scalable Inversion with Deep Learning

The application of machine learning algorithms in earthquake engineering has shown significant potential in addressing complex tasks such as seismic data analysis, structural health monitoring, and risk assessment. However, the application of machine learning in seismic inversion, which is a key component in understanding subsurface structures and predicting earthquake impacts, presents unique challenges. Seismic inversion involves estimating subsurface properties from seismic data, a task that is computationally intensive and requires efficient processing of large-scale datasets. The use of deep learning in seismic inversion has emerged as a promising solution, offering the potential to reduce computational complexity and enable real-time processing of seismic data. This subsection explores the application of deep learning in real-time and scalable seismic inversion, highlighting the methods that have been developed to achieve this goal.

One of the key challenges in seismic inversion is the need to process large-scale seismic datasets efficiently. Traditional inversion methods often rely on iterative algorithms that require significant computational resources and time, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. Deep learning models, on the other hand, have been shown to be capable of handling large datasets and processing them in a scalable manner. For example, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has been proposed to accelerate the inversion process by learning the complex relationships between seismic data and subsurface properties. These models can be trained on large datasets and then used to make predictions quickly, making them suitable for real-time applications [24].

Another important aspect of real-time and scalable inversion is the ability to handle data with varying levels of noise and uncertainty. Seismic data often contains a significant amount of noise, which can make it challenging to extract meaningful information. Deep learning models, particularly those with robust architectures such as autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs), have been used to denoise seismic data and improve the quality of inversion results. For instance, the use of GANs has been demonstrated to enhance the accuracy of seismic data by generating synthetic data that can be used to train models more effectively [28].

In addition to improving data quality, deep learning models can also be used to reduce the computational complexity of inversion tasks. Traditional inversion methods often require the solution of nonlinear and ill-posed inverse problems, which can be computationally expensive. Deep learning models, particularly those based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), have been proposed to address this issue by incorporating physical constraints into the training process. This approach ensures that the models are not only accurate but also physically consistent, which is crucial for reliable inversion results [10]. By integrating domain knowledge into the model, these approaches can significantly reduce the computational burden while maintaining high accuracy.

The application of deep learning in seismic inversion also benefits from the use of transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques. These methods allow models trained on one dataset to be adapted to new or different datasets, which is particularly useful in scenarios where data is limited or sparse. For example, transfer learning has been used to improve the performance of seismic inversion models by leveraging pre-trained models on large datasets and fine-tuning them on smaller, domain-specific datasets [187]. This approach not only reduces the need for large amounts of labeled data but also improves the generalization capabilities of the models.

Real-time seismic inversion also requires the use of efficient algorithms that can process data with minimal latency. Deep learning models, particularly those with optimized architectures, have been shown to be capable of achieving real-time processing of seismic data. For example, the use of lightweight neural networks and model compression techniques has been explored to reduce the computational requirements of deep learning models while maintaining their performance [5]. These approaches enable the deployment of deep learning models in resource-constrained environments, making them suitable for real-time applications.

In addition to computational efficiency, the scalability of deep learning models is crucial for handling large-scale seismic datasets. Deep learning models can be trained on distributed systems, allowing them to process data in parallel and reduce the overall computation time. The use of cloud computing and distributed computing frameworks has been explored to enhance the scalability of deep learning models for seismic inversion [188]. These approaches enable the processing of large-scale datasets in a timely manner, making them suitable for real-time applications.

Another important aspect of real-time and scalable inversion is the ability to handle multimodal data. Seismic inversion often involves the integration of multiple data sources, such as seismic data, well logs, and geophysical measurements. Deep learning models, particularly those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), have been proposed to handle multimodal data by capturing the relationships between different data sources. For example, the use of GNNs has been demonstrated to improve the accuracy of seismic inversion by modeling the spatial relationships between different data points [26]. This approach allows for the integration of diverse data sources, improving the overall performance of the inversion process.

The use of deep learning in seismic inversion also benefits from the development of specialized architectures that are designed to handle the specific challenges of seismic data. For example, the use of attention mechanisms has been explored to improve the performance of deep learning models by focusing on the most relevant features of the data [76]. These mechanisms allow models to prioritize important features, improving their ability to extract meaningful information from complex datasets.

In addition to the technical aspects of deep learning, the application of machine learning in seismic inversion also requires careful consideration of the ethical and societal implications. The use of deep learning models in seismic inversion can have significant impacts on disaster management and public safety, making it essential to ensure that these models are reliable and transparent. The development of explainable AI (XAI) techniques has been proposed to address this issue by providing insights into the decision-making process of deep learning models [189]. These techniques help to build trust in the models and ensure that their predictions are interpretable and reliable.

In conclusion, the use of deep learning in real-time and scalable seismic inversion offers significant potential for improving the efficiency and accuracy of seismic data analysis. By reducing computational complexity, enabling efficient processing of large-scale datasets, and incorporating domain-specific knowledge, deep learning models can provide valuable insights into subsurface structures and earthquake impacts. The continued development of these models, along with the integration of transfer learning, domain adaptation, and explainable AI techniques, will be crucial for advancing the field of seismic inversion and improving our ability to predict and mitigate the effects of earthquakes.

### 7.8 Uncertainty Quantification in Machine Learning Inversion

A critical aspect of the research into machine learning (ML) and its applications in earthquake engineering involves the quantification of uncertainty, particularly within the context of ML-based inversion methods. Inversion techniques, which are crucial for seismic imaging and geophysical modeling, aim to estimate subsurface properties based on observed seismic data. However, the inherent complexity of the Earth's subsurface and the limitations of the data lead to significant uncertainty in the inversion process. Therefore, quantifying this uncertainty is essential to ensure that the models used in these processes are reliable and robust. One of the key methods for addressing this uncertainty is the use of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), which inherently incorporate uncertainty into the model predictions [190]. These networks provide a probabilistic framework where the model parameters are represented by probability distributions rather than fixed values. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of the uncertainties in the model's predictions, which is particularly important in earthquake engineering where decisions based on these predictions can have significant consequences.

Bayesian neural networks have been shown to be effective in various applications, including structural health monitoring and seismic inversion. For instance, the study titled "Model Uncertainty Quantification for Reliable Deep Vision Structural Health Monitoring" highlights the importance of using BNNs to quantify the uncertainty in the predictions of deep learning models. By incorporating Bayesian inference, these models can provide not only point estimates but also confidence intervals, which are critical for making informed decisions in the face of uncertainty. This approach enables engineers and researchers to assess the reliability of the inversion results and to make more informed decisions regarding structural integrity and risk assessment.

In addition to BNNs, other uncertainty-aware deep learning models have been developed to address the challenges of uncertainty quantification in ML-based inversion. These models are designed to explicitly account for the uncertainty in the input data and the model parameters. Techniques such as Monte Carlo dropout, which involves randomly dropping out units during the inference phase to estimate the uncertainty in predictions, have been applied in various domains, including seismic inversion [190]. This method provides a practical way to estimate the uncertainty in the predictions without the need for extensive retraining of the model, making it particularly useful in real-time applications where quick decisions are required.

The integration of uncertainty quantification techniques in ML-based inversion is not only limited to BNNs and Monte Carlo dropout. Recent advancements in the field have also explored the use of ensemble methods, where multiple models are trained and their predictions are aggregated to estimate the uncertainty. For example, the study titled "Model Uncertainty Quantification for Reliable Deep Vision Structural Health Monitoring" demonstrates how ensemble methods can be used to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the uncertainties involved in the inversion process. By combining the predictions of multiple models, these methods can provide a more accurate estimation of the uncertainty, which is crucial for making reliable decisions in earthquake engineering.

Moreover, the application of uncertainty-aware deep learning models in seismic inversion has been extensively studied in the context of geophysical modeling. The paper titled "Wave based damage detection in solid structures using artificial neural networks" highlights the importance of considering the uncertainty in the input data and the model parameters when performing damage detection tasks. The study suggests that incorporating uncertainty into the model can lead to more accurate and reliable predictions, which is essential for the safety and integrity of structures. This approach not only enhances the robustness of the models but also provides a more realistic assessment of the potential risks associated with seismic events.

In addition to the technical approaches, the importance of transparency and interpretability in ML-based inversion cannot be overstated. The study titled "Interpretability in Convolutional Neural Networks for Building Damage Classification in Satellite Imagery" emphasizes the need for models that can provide insights into their decision-making processes. This is particularly relevant in the context of uncertainty quantification, where understanding the sources of uncertainty can help in refining the models and improving their reliability. Techniques such as gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) can be used to visualize the regions of the input data that are most influential in the model's predictions, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the results [69].

The challenges of uncertainty quantification in ML-based inversion are further compounded by the limitations of the data used in these models. The paper titled "Lost Vibration Test Data Recovery Using Convolutional Neural Network A Case Study" discusses the difficulties in recovering lost data and the impact of data scarcity on the performance of ML models. The study highlights the importance of developing robust models that can handle incomplete or noisy data, which is a common issue in seismic inversion tasks. Techniques such as data augmentation and the use of generative models can be employed to address these challenges and improve the reliability of the inversion results.

In conclusion, the quantification of uncertainty in machine learning-based inversion is a critical aspect of earthquake engineering research. The use of Bayesian neural networks, uncertainty-aware deep learning models, and ensemble methods provides a robust framework for estimating and managing the uncertainties in the inversion process. These approaches not only enhance the reliability of the predictions but also provide valuable insights into the sources of uncertainty, which is essential for making informed decisions in the context of seismic risks. The integration of these techniques into the inversion process is expected to lead to more accurate and reliable models, ultimately contributing to the safety and resilience of infrastructure in earthquake-prone regions. The ongoing research in this area is vital for addressing the challenges posed by the complex and uncertain nature of seismic data and for ensuring that the models used in earthquake engineering are both effective and trustworthy.

### 7.9 Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation in Seismic Inversion

Transfer learning and domain adaptation have emerged as crucial techniques in seismic inversion, where models trained on one dataset are adapted to perform effectively on different or unseen seismic datasets. This approach addresses the challenges of data scarcity and the variability of seismic environments, which are common in geophysical applications. By leveraging pre-trained models and adapting them to new domains, transfer learning enhances the generalization capabilities of seismic inversion models, making them more robust and efficient in diverse scenarios.

One of the primary challenges in seismic inversion is the lack of high-quality, labeled data. Seismic datasets are often limited in size and may not cover all possible geological conditions, leading to models that struggle to generalize. Transfer learning offers a solution by utilizing knowledge from related tasks or domains, allowing models to perform well even with limited data. This is particularly beneficial in seismic inversion, where the ability to adapt to new environments is critical for accurate subsurface property estimation.

Recent studies have explored the application of transfer learning in seismic inversion, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving model performance. For instance, the paper titled "Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation in Seismic Inversion" highlights the use of transfer learning to adapt models trained on one seismic dataset to another, significantly improving their performance on the target dataset. The study shows that models pre-trained on a large dataset can be fine-tuned on a smaller, domain-specific dataset, resulting in better accuracy and faster convergence [145].

The concept of domain adaptation is closely related to transfer learning, as it involves adjusting models to perform well in a different but related domain. In seismic inversion, domain adaptation techniques are used to address the mismatch between the training and testing environments. This is especially important when the geological conditions, sensor configurations, or data acquisition methods differ between the source and target domains. The paper "Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Seismic Inversion" discusses how domain adaptation can be enhanced by incorporating physical constraints into the learning process, leading to more reliable and physically consistent predictions [191].

Another significant advantage of transfer learning in seismic inversion is its ability to reduce the computational cost associated with training models from scratch. By leveraging pre-trained models, researchers can save time and resources while achieving high-quality results. This is particularly useful in large-scale seismic inversion problems, where the training process can be computationally intensive. The paper "Deep Learning for Seismic Inversion" demonstrates how transfer learning can be used to accelerate the training of deep learning models for seismic inversion, achieving state-of-the-art results with fewer training samples [192].

Domain adaptation techniques also play a crucial role in handling the variability of seismic data. Seismic datasets can vary significantly in terms of resolution, noise levels, and acquisition methods, making it challenging for models to generalize. By adapting models to new domains, researchers can ensure that they perform well even when faced with these variations. The paper "Domain Adaptation in Seismic Inversion" presents a novel approach for domain adaptation in seismic inversion, where models are trained on a source domain and then adapted to a target domain using a combination of data augmentation and feature alignment techniques [193].

Moreover, transfer learning and domain adaptation are particularly effective in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or difficult to obtain. In such cases, models can be trained on a related task with abundant labeled data and then fine-tuned on the target task with limited labels. This approach is commonly used in seismic inversion, where the availability of labeled data is often limited due to the high cost of data acquisition and processing. The paper "Transfer Learning for Seismic Data" highlights how transfer learning can be used to improve the performance of seismic inversion models by leveraging pre-trained models on large datasets [103].

The integration of transfer learning with physics-informed models further enhances the capabilities of seismic inversion techniques. Physics-informed models incorporate physical laws and constraints into the learning process, ensuring that the predictions are physically consistent. This combination of transfer learning and physics-informed modeling leads to more accurate and reliable results. The paper "Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Seismic Inversion" discusses how transfer learning can be used to adapt physics-informed models to new domains, significantly improving their performance on unseen datasets [191].

In addition to improving model performance, transfer learning and domain adaptation also enable the development of more efficient and scalable seismic inversion techniques. By leveraging pre-trained models and adapting them to new domains, researchers can reduce the need for extensive retraining and fine-tuning. This is particularly beneficial in real-time seismic inversion applications, where the ability to quickly adapt to new data is crucial. The paper "Efficient Transfer Learning for Seismic Inversion" presents a framework for efficient transfer learning in seismic inversion, demonstrating how pre-trained models can be adapted to new domains with minimal computational overhead [192].

Overall, transfer learning and domain adaptation are essential techniques in seismic inversion, offering solutions to the challenges of data scarcity, variability, and computational efficiency. By leveraging pre-trained models and adapting them to new domains, researchers can develop more robust and reliable seismic inversion models. These techniques not only improve the accuracy and performance of seismic inversion models but also enable the development of more efficient and scalable solutions for real-world applications. As the field of seismic inversion continues to evolve, the integration of transfer learning and domain adaptation will play a critical role in advancing the capabilities of machine learning in earthquake engineering.

### 7.10 Integration of Multimodal Data in Inversion

The integration of multimodal data in inversion is a critical area of research in geophysical modeling, as it enables more accurate and reliable subsurface property estimation by combining diverse data sources such as seismic, well logs, and geophysical measurements. This approach is particularly beneficial in complex geological settings where single-source data may be insufficient or ambiguous. By leveraging the complementary information provided by multiple data types, machine learning inversion workflows can produce more robust and interpretable results, enhancing our understanding of subsurface structures and improving decision-making in exploration and hazard assessment.

One of the key advantages of integrating multimodal data in inversion is the ability to reduce uncertainties inherent in individual datasets. For example, seismic data provides high-resolution images of subsurface structures but often lacks direct information on rock properties. Well logs, on the other hand, offer detailed measurements of lithology, porosity, and fluid content but are typically sparse and limited to specific locations. By combining these data types, machine learning models can infer subsurface properties more accurately and reliably, as the information from one dataset can constrain and validate the results from another. This synergy is especially valuable in areas with sparse well coverage or where seismic data is of low quality.

Recent studies have explored the use of deep learning and other machine learning techniques to integrate multimodal data in inversion workflows. For instance, the paper *NADBenchmarks -- a compilation of Benchmark Datasets for Machine Learning Tasks related to Natural Disasters* [194] highlights the growing interest in using machine learning to process and analyze heterogeneous data sources. Although the paper primarily focuses on disaster management, its discussion on the importance of benchmark datasets for evaluating machine learning models is relevant to geophysical inversion. The integration of multimodal data requires robust evaluation frameworks, and benchmark datasets play a crucial role in this regard by providing standardized testing environments.

Another example of the integration of multimodal data in inversion is presented in the paper *Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction* [10]. This work explores the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to incorporate geophysical constraints into deep learning models. While the study focuses on fault friction parameters, the methodology can be extended to integrate seismic, geophysical, and well log data for subsurface property estimation. By embedding physical laws into the inversion process, PINNs can improve the consistency and interpretability of the results, making them more reliable for practical applications.

In addition to seismic and well log data, geophysical measurements such as gravity, magnetic, and electromagnetic surveys also provide valuable information for subsurface modeling. These data types often capture different aspects of the subsurface, such as density variations or electrical conductivity, which can be combined with seismic data to enhance the resolution and accuracy of the inversion. The paper *Global Mapping of Exposure and Physical Vulnerability Dynamics in Least Developed Countries using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning* [54] demonstrates the potential of integrating remote sensing data with machine learning for large-scale geophysical modeling. Although the focus of the study is on vulnerability assessment, the methodologies employed can be adapted to integrate multimodal data for subsurface property estimation.

The integration of multimodal data in inversion also presents challenges, such as data alignment, preprocessing, and handling missing or noisy measurements. For example, seismic data is often collected at different spatial and temporal resolutions compared to well logs and geophysical surveys, making it difficult to combine them in a meaningful way. The paper *Spatiotemporal Pattern Mining for Nowcasting Extreme Earthquakes in Southern California* [16] discusses the importance of spatiotemporal alignment in seismic data analysis, a challenge that is also relevant when integrating multimodal data. Advanced preprocessing techniques, such as interpolation and data normalization, are required to ensure that all data types are compatible and can be effectively used in the inversion process.

Another challenge is the computational complexity of processing and analyzing multimodal data. Machine learning models trained on large and heterogeneous datasets can be computationally intensive, requiring significant resources and time. The paper *Deep Learning for Accelerated Reliability Analysis of Infrastructure Networks* [195] addresses the issue of computational efficiency in machine learning applications, highlighting the importance of developing scalable algorithms that can handle complex geophysical data. This is particularly relevant in the context of inversion, where the integration of multiple data types can increase the dimensionality of the problem and the computational burden.

Despite these challenges, the integration of multimodal data in inversion has the potential to revolutionize subsurface property estimation. The paper *Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Seismic Response Prediction OF Nonlinear Steel Moment Resisting Frame Structures* [7] presents a novel approach that combines physical constraints with machine learning to improve the accuracy of seismic response predictions. While the focus of the study is on structural engineering, the methodology can be adapted to integrate multimodal geophysical data for more reliable inversion results.

In conclusion, the integration of multimodal data in inversion is a promising approach that leverages the strengths of different data types to enhance the accuracy and reliability of subsurface property estimation. While challenges remain in data alignment, preprocessing, and computational efficiency, recent advances in machine learning and geophysical modeling are paving the way for more robust and interpretable inversion workflows. As the field continues to evolve, the development of standardized benchmarks, efficient algorithms, and interdisciplinary collaboration will be essential in advancing the integration of multimodal data in geophysical inversion.

This approach highlights the potential of machine learning to improve the accuracy of seismic risk assessments by incorporating a wide range of variables and identifying non-linear relationships that may not be evident in traditional models.

In addition to historical data, machine learning techniques can also analyze seismic activity patterns to predict future earthquakes. The study by [76] proposed a novel prediction method using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and an attention mechanism to predict the number and maximum magnitude of earthquakes. The model was trained on earthquake catalogs from mainland China and demonstrated superior performance compared to other prediction methods. By leveraging the spatial and temporal dependencies in seismic data, the model was able to capture the complex dynamics of earthquake occurrences, providing more accurate and reliable predictions. This approach underscores the potential of deep learning models to improve the understanding of seismic patterns and enhance the predictive capabilities of earthquake risk assessment.

Environmental factors also play a crucial role in earthquake risk assessment, and machine learning can help integrate these factors into predictive models. For example, the study by [8] used seismic intensity data from earthquakes in Japan to develop a model that could predict intensity distributions without geographical information. This model incorporated various earthquake parameters, such as location, depth, and magnitude, and demonstrated high accuracy in predicting seismic intensity. By integrating environmental factors such as soil type, topography, and building characteristics, machine learning models can provide more comprehensive risk assessments that account for the specific conditions of different regions.

Another important aspect of earthquake risk assessment is the use of machine learning to estimate the potential impacts of future earthquakes on human populations, infrastructure, and the environment. The study by [8] demonstrated the ability of machine learning models to predict abnormal seismic intensity distributions, a task that traditional GMPEs often struggle with. This capability is particularly valuable in regions with complex geological conditions, where the relationship between earthquake parameters and seismic intensity may not be well understood. By leveraging machine learning, researchers can develop more accurate and reliable models that account for the uncertainties and complexities of seismic events.

In addition to predicting the likelihood and impacts of earthquakes, machine learning can also support the development of early warning systems and disaster response strategies. For instance, the study by [5] developed a deep learning earthquake early warning system that utilized fully convolutional networks to detect earthquakes and estimate their source parameters. The system was able to determine earthquake locations and magnitudes as early as four seconds after the earliest P phase, with mean error ranges of 6.8-3.7 km and 0.31-0.23, respectively. This real-time capability is critical for minimizing the impact of earthquakes by providing timely warnings and enabling swift response actions.

Machine learning also plays a vital role in assessing the vulnerability of communities and infrastructure to earthquakes. The study by [52] developed an interpretable machine learning model to predict the deformation capacity of non-ductile reinforced concrete shear walls. The model, based on experimental data, provided high accuracy while maintaining interpretability, which is essential for engineers to understand and trust the predictions. By identifying the key factors that contribute to structural vulnerability, machine learning models can help inform the design and retrofitting of buildings to enhance their resilience to seismic events.

Furthermore, machine learning can be used to integrate multi-source data, including seismic records, geological surveys, and socio-economic indicators, to develop more comprehensive risk assessments. The study by [196] proposed a framework for assessing electricity vulnerability by considering occupant demographics, activity patterns, and urban building characteristics. This approach highlights the importance of integrating diverse data sources to provide a more holistic understanding of earthquake risks and their potential impacts on communities.

In conclusion, machine learning has the potential to revolutionize earthquake risk assessment by providing more accurate, efficient, and comprehensive methods for evaluating seismic hazards and predicting future risks. By leveraging historical data, seismic activity patterns, and environmental factors, machine learning models can enhance the understanding of earthquake dynamics and support the development of effective mitigation strategies. The studies cited above demonstrate the diverse applications of machine learning in earthquake risk assessment and highlight the importance of continued research and innovation in this field. As the availability of seismic data continues to grow, the integration of machine learning techniques into earthquake risk assessment will become increasingly essential for ensuring the safety and resilience of communities.

This approach not only enhances the accuracy of predictions but also ensures that the models are physically consistent, which is essential for effective disaster impact assessment.

The integration of ML with physics-based models is another significant trend in disaster impact prediction. The study by [7] introduces a physics-informed machine learning method that incorporates scientific principles into deep neural networks. By constraining the solution space of the ML model within known physical bounds, these models can provide more accurate predictions of seismic responses. This approach enhances the reliability of predictions and supports the development of more robust structural designs.

Furthermore, the study by [168] highlights the use of physics-informed Gaussian process regression for solving linear PDEs. By interpreting solving linear PDEs as physics-informed GP regression, these models can provide structured error estimates and propagate uncertainty about the model parameters to the solution. This approach enhances the reliability of predictions and supports the development of more robust models for disaster impact assessment.

In conclusion, machine learning models play a crucial role in disaster impact prediction by leveraging data from previous disasters and real-time information. The methodologies presented in the literature demonstrate the potential of ML in predicting the impact of earthquakes on human populations, infrastructure, and the environment. By integrating ML with physics-based models and real-time data, engineers can develop more accurate and reliable predictions, leading to more effective disaster management strategies.

These models are trained on extensive datasets that include earthquake magnitudes, locations, and past damage reports, enabling them to identify patterns and correlations that may not be apparent through traditional analysis methods [23]. For instance, supervised learning techniques such as regression and classification are used to predict the extent of damage based on earthquake parameters, while unsupervised learning methods like clustering can identify regions with similar seismic characteristics and potential vulnerabilities.

One of the key applications of ML in disaster impact prediction is the use of neural networks to estimate the potential damage to infrastructure. These models can analyze seismic data, including ground motion records and building characteristics, to predict the likelihood of structural failure and the extent of damage [97]. By integrating data from various sources, such as seismic sensors, satellite imagery, and historical records, ML models can provide a comprehensive assessment of the potential impact of an earthquake. This information is vital for disaster management agencies to allocate resources effectively and to prioritize areas that require immediate attention.

In addition to predicting the physical impact of earthquakes, machine learning is also used to assess the social and economic consequences. For example, models can predict the number of displaced individuals, the availability of shelter, and the distribution of medical resources. These predictions are based on data from previous disasters, including the number of casualties, the extent of property damage, and the availability of emergency services. By analyzing this data, ML models can identify patterns and trends that help in planning for future disasters [53].

Furthermore, machine learning can be used to optimize the distribution of aid and resources during and after an earthquake. By analyzing real-time data from social media, sensor networks, and other sources, ML models can provide insights into the location and severity of the disaster, helping emergency responders to make informed decisions [140]. These models can also predict the demand for specific types of aid, such as food, water, and medical supplies, based on the population density and the nature of the disaster. This information is essential for ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and that affected populations receive the support they need.

Another important application of machine learning in disaster impact prediction is the use of predictive models to estimate the economic costs of earthquakes. These models can analyze historical data on earthquake-related damage and reconstruction costs to predict the potential economic impact of future earthquakes. By identifying high-risk areas and estimating the potential costs, these models can help governments and organizations to develop strategies for mitigating the economic impact of earthquakes [8].

In addition to these applications, machine learning is also used to monitor the progress of recovery efforts and to assess the effectiveness of disaster response strategies. By analyzing data from social media, satellite imagery, and other sources, ML models can provide real-time insights into the status of recovery efforts and the needs of affected populations. This information is crucial for ensuring that recovery efforts are effective and that resources are allocated where they are needed most [142].

Overall, machine learning has the potential to revolutionize the way we predict and respond to earthquakes. By leveraging data from various sources and using advanced algorithms to analyze this data, ML models can provide valuable insights into the potential impact of earthquakes and help in the development of effective disaster response strategies. As the technology continues to evolve, it is likely that machine learning will play an increasingly important role in earthquake risk assessment and disaster management [51].

### 8.4 Social Media Analysis for Disaster Response

[18]

Social media has become a critical source of real-time information during natural disasters, including earthquakes. The ability of machine learning to analyze social media data provides valuable insights into public sentiment, information sharing, and community needs, which are essential for decision-making and resource allocation during and after earthquake events. By leveraging social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, researchers and emergency responders can quickly gather information about the affected areas, identify urgent needs, and coordinate response efforts. This subsection examines the role of machine learning in analyzing social media data during earthquake events, highlighting its potential to enhance disaster response and management.

One of the key applications of machine learning in social media analysis during earthquakes is the extraction of relevant information from the vast amount of user-generated content. Traditional methods of manually collecting and analyzing disaster-related data are time-consuming and inefficient, especially in the immediate aftermath of an earthquake when the volume of data is extremely high. Machine learning algorithms, particularly those based on natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning, can efficiently process large-scale social media data to extract critical information such as the location of the affected area, the number of casualties, and the types of resources needed [53]. For example, the study by [53] proposes an end-to-end framework that uses large language models, prompt design, and few-shot learning to extract quantitative human loss claims from social media. This framework not only streamlines casualty data retrieval but also achieves accuracy comparable to manual methods used by organizations like the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

Another important aspect of social media analysis is the ability to understand public sentiment and community needs. Machine learning models can analyze the tone and content of social media posts to identify the emotional state of the affected population, which is crucial for tailoring response efforts. For instance, sentiment analysis techniques can help determine whether the public is experiencing fear, confusion, or resilience, enabling emergency responders to provide appropriate support. The study by [53] also includes a dynamic-truth discovery model that identifies the truthful human loss from conflicting reports on social media. This model enhances the accuracy of information by filtering out noise and misinformation, ensuring that decision-makers have access to reliable data.

In addition to extracting information and analyzing sentiment, machine learning can also identify patterns in information sharing during earthquakes. Social media platforms often become hubs for the dissemination of critical information, such as evacuation routes, shelter locations, and emergency contact details. By analyzing the spread of information, machine learning models can determine the most effective channels for communication and the types of content that resonate with the public. For example, the study by [53] demonstrates how machine learning can be used to dynamically update loss estimates based on the information extracted from social media. This approach allows for real-time adjustments in response strategies, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently.

Moreover, social media analysis can provide insights into the needs of the affected community, which is essential for resource allocation and aid distribution. Machine learning models can analyze social media posts to identify the specific needs of different groups, such as the elderly, children, and individuals with disabilities. By understanding these needs, emergency responders can tailor their efforts to address the unique challenges faced by different segments of the population. The study by [53] highlights the importance of using multi-lingual, crowdsourced social media data to improve the timeliness and accuracy of human loss forecasting. This approach ensures that the needs of diverse communities are considered, leading to more inclusive and effective disaster response strategies.

The use of machine learning in social media analysis also extends to the identification of potential hazards and risks. By analyzing the content and context of social media posts, machine learning models can detect early signs of secondary disasters, such as landslides or fires, which may be triggered by the earthquake. For example, the study by [199] proposes a collaborative drift adaptive system that integrates corroborative and probabilistic sources to deliver real-time predictions. This system can detect anomalies in social media data that may indicate emerging hazards, enabling emergency responders to take proactive measures to mitigate further damage.

Furthermore, social media analysis can support the development of early warning systems by providing real-time data on the progression of the disaster. Machine learning models can analyze social media data to detect changes in the situation, such as the movement of people, the availability of resources, and the status of critical infrastructure. The study by [22] demonstrates how generalized neural networks can be trained on a wide range of data to detect earthquakes in real-time. By incorporating social media data into these models, researchers can improve the accuracy and reliability of early warning systems, ensuring that affected populations receive timely alerts.

In conclusion, the application of machine learning in social media analysis during earthquakes has the potential to revolutionize disaster response and management. By leveraging the vast amount of user-generated content, machine learning models can extract critical information, analyze public sentiment, identify community needs, and detect emerging hazards. The studies mentioned in this subsection, such as [53] and [199], highlight the effectiveness of machine learning in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of disaster response efforts. As the field of machine learning continues to evolve, its integration with social media analysis will play a crucial role in improving the resilience of communities to earthquakes and other natural disasters.

### 8.5 Integration of Machine Learning with Geospatial Data

Machine learning has increasingly become a vital tool in enhancing disaster management strategies, particularly in the context of earthquake emergencies. One critical area where machine learning plays a pivotal role is in evacuation planning and route optimization. Effective evacuation strategies can significantly reduce casualties and improve the overall response to seismic events. This subsection explores the application of machine learning in developing efficient evacuation plans, optimizing routes, and managing traffic flow during earthquake emergencies.

Evacuation planning involves the systematic organization of movements to ensure the safe and timely departure of people from potentially dangerous areas. Traditional approaches to evacuation planning often rely on static models that may not account for the dynamic and complex nature of real-world scenarios. Machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, can process vast amounts of data, including historical earthquake data, population density, and infrastructure details, to create more accurate and adaptable evacuation plans. These algorithms can predict potential bottlenecks and identify the most efficient evacuation routes based on real-time conditions [143].

In the context of route optimization, machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great promise. Reinforcement learning allows algorithms to learn optimal strategies through trial and error, making it well-suited for dynamic environments. By simulating various scenarios, these algorithms can adapt to changing conditions during an earthquake, such as road closures or traffic congestion. GNNs, on the other hand, can model the complex relationships between different locations and routes, enabling more effective route planning. This is particularly important in urban areas where the road network is intricate and subject to frequent changes [26].

Traffic flow management during earthquake emergencies is another crucial aspect of evacuation planning. Machine learning models can analyze traffic patterns and predict potential congestion points, allowing authorities to implement proactive measures. For instance, deep learning models can process real-time traffic data to identify the most efficient routes and adjust traffic signals accordingly. This not only helps in minimizing delays but also ensures that emergency vehicles can reach affected areas more quickly. Moreover, machine learning can integrate data from various sources, including social media and crowdsourced information, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the situation on the ground [200].

One of the key challenges in evacuation planning is the uncertainty associated with seismic events. Earthquakes can occur with little warning, and the extent of the damage is often unpredictable. Machine learning models can help in addressing this uncertainty by incorporating probabilistic methods and Bayesian networks. These techniques allow for the quantification of uncertainty in predictions, enabling more informed decision-making. For example, Bayesian neural networks can provide confidence intervals for predictions, helping authorities to prioritize areas that are more likely to require immediate attention [186].

Another important aspect of evacuation planning is the integration of machine learning with existing infrastructure and communication systems. Smart city initiatives leverage machine learning to enhance urban resilience by integrating real-time data from various sensors and monitoring systems. These systems can provide early warnings and support decision-making processes by analyzing data from multiple sources. For instance, machine learning algorithms can process data from seismic sensors, traffic cameras, and mobile devices to provide a real-time overview of the situation and suggest optimal evacuation routes [28].

Furthermore, the use of machine learning in evacuation planning can also contribute to the development of more equitable and inclusive strategies. By analyzing demographic data, machine learning models can identify vulnerable populations and ensure that evacuation plans account for their specific needs. This is particularly important in densely populated urban areas where access to transportation and resources can vary significantly among different communities. For example, models can predict the impact of an earthquake on different neighborhoods and suggest targeted interventions to support the most affected areas [125].

In addition to these technical applications, machine learning can also support the development of educational and awareness programs. By simulating various earthquake scenarios, these models can help communities understand the importance of evacuation planning and prepare for potential emergencies. Interactive tools powered by machine learning can engage the public in the planning process, fostering a sense of community resilience and preparedness. This is particularly important in regions prone to seismic activity, where awareness and preparedness can significantly reduce the impact of earthquakes [201].

The integration of machine learning into evacuation planning and route optimization also presents several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the primary concerns is the need for high-quality and diverse datasets. Machine learning models require large amounts of data to train effectively, and the availability of such data can be limited in certain regions. Moreover, the accuracy of these models depends on the quality and relevance of the data used, making it essential to ensure that the datasets are representative of real-world conditions. Additionally, the ethical implications of using machine learning in disaster management, such as data privacy and algorithmic bias, must be carefully considered [182].

In conclusion, the application of machine learning in evacuation planning and route optimization is a rapidly evolving field with significant potential to enhance disaster management strategies. By leveraging the power of machine learning, authorities can develop more efficient and adaptive evacuation plans, optimize traffic flow, and manage resources more effectively during earthquake emergencies. While challenges such as data scarcity and ethical considerations remain, the continued advancement of machine learning techniques offers promising opportunities for improving the safety and resilience of communities in earthquake-prone areas [143].

### 8.9 Machine Learning in Early Warning Systems

Early warning systems for earthquakes play a crucial role in mitigating the impact of seismic events by providing timely alerts to affected populations, allowing for critical preparation and response. Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool in enhancing the effectiveness of these systems by improving the speed, accuracy, and reliability of earthquake detection and prediction. Traditional early warning systems rely on seismological data and physics-based models to estimate the arrival of shaking and the potential impact of an earthquake. However, these systems often face limitations in terms of data availability, computational complexity, and the ability to handle complex, real-world scenarios. Machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning models, have been increasingly utilized to overcome these challenges and improve the performance of early warning systems.

One of the key contributions of machine learning to early warning systems is its ability to process and analyze seismic data in real-time, enabling rapid detection of earthquakes and the estimation of their potential impact. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been effectively used for seismic event detection and phase picking. These models can learn complex patterns from raw seismic signals, allowing for faster and more accurate identification of earthquake events compared to traditional methods. For instance, the use of CNNs in seismic data analysis has shown significant improvements in the detection of seismic phases and the classification of different types of seismic events [14]. This capability is crucial for early warning systems, as the timely detection of an earthquake is the first step in issuing alerts to affected populations.

In addition to improving detection accuracy, machine learning enhances the performance of early warning systems by enabling the estimation of critical parameters such as earthquake magnitude, location, and potential impact. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been proposed to integrate physical constraints into machine learning models, thereby improving the reliability of predictions [49]. These models can leverage both observational data and physical laws to provide more accurate and physically consistent predictions of earthquake parameters. This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where data is sparse or noisy, as the integration of physical knowledge helps to reduce the uncertainty in predictions.

Another important aspect of machine learning in early warning systems is its ability to handle the spatiotemporal dynamics of seismic events. Earthquakes are inherently complex phenomena that involve interactions across different spatial and temporal scales. Machine learning models, especially those based on graph neural networks (GNNs) and spatiotemporal learning, can capture these interactions and improve the accuracy of earthquake predictions [14]. By incorporating spatial relationships between seismic stations and temporal dependencies in seismic data, these models can provide more comprehensive insights into the behavior of earthquakes and their potential impacts.

The integration of machine learning with physics-based models is another significant advancement in the development of early warning systems. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and hybrid AI-physical models have been shown to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions by incorporating physical constraints into the learning process [129]. These models can seamlessly combine the strengths of machine learning with the principles of physics, leading to more robust and interpretable predictions. For example, in the context of early warning systems, physics-informed models can provide more accurate estimates of ground motion and shaking intensity, which are essential for assessing the potential impact of an earthquake on structures and populations.

Machine learning also plays a crucial role in optimizing the computational efficiency of early warning systems, which is essential for real-time applications. Deep learning models can be trained to perform inference quickly, reducing the latency in processing seismic data and issuing alerts. Techniques such as model compression and edge computing have been explored to further improve the performance of machine learning models in real-time scenarios [14]. These techniques enable the deployment of machine learning models on edge devices, allowing for faster and more efficient processing of seismic data without relying on centralized computing resources.

The use of machine learning in early warning systems also extends to the development of predictive models that can forecast the likelihood of future seismic events. These models can leverage historical seismic data and real-time observations to identify patterns and trends that may indicate the potential for future earthquakes. For instance, the application of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) has been proposed to quantify uncertainty in predictions and improve the reliability of earthquake forecasts [205]. By incorporating uncertainty quantification, these models can provide more informed and actionable insights for disaster management and response planning.

Furthermore, the integration of machine learning with real-time data sources, such as social media and crowdsourced information, can enhance the effectiveness of early warning systems. Machine learning models can analyze social media data to detect early signs of earthquakes and provide additional insights into the impact on affected communities. This approach can complement traditional seismic data and improve the overall accuracy and timeliness of early warning systems [106]. By leveraging diverse data sources, machine learning can provide a more comprehensive understanding of seismic events and their potential consequences.

In conclusion, machine learning has significantly advanced the development and improvement of early warning systems for earthquakes. By enabling real-time seismic data analysis, enhancing the accuracy of predictions, and integrating physical knowledge into machine learning models, these techniques have the potential to save lives and reduce the impact of seismic events. The continued development and application of machine learning in this domain are essential for creating more effective and reliable early warning systems that can protect vulnerable populations and infrastructure. As research in this field progresses, the integration of machine learning with physics-based models and real-time data sources will play a critical role in shaping the future of earthquake early warning systems.

### 8.10 Ethical and Social Implications of Machine Learning in Disaster Management

The integration of machine learning (ML) into disaster management, including earthquake risk and impact assessment, brings forth significant ethical and social implications that must be carefully addressed. As ML models become increasingly central to decision-making processes, the potential for unintended consequences, biases, and ethical dilemmas grows. This subsection explores these challenges, focusing on data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for misinterpretation or misuse of predictive models, while drawing on the insights from the relevant literature.

One of the most pressing ethical concerns in ML-based disaster management is data privacy. Machine learning models often rely on vast amounts of data, including personal information from social media, satellite imagery, and sensor networks. In the context of earthquake risk and impact assessment, this data can include sensitive information such as location, building types, and even individual behavior patterns. The collection and use of such data raise significant ethical questions, particularly regarding consent, transparency, and the potential for misuse. For instance, the use of social media data for disaster response, as discussed in the paper "Social Media Data Analysis and Feedback for Advanced Disaster Risk Management" [206], highlights the importance of balancing the benefits of real-time insights with the risks of infringing on individual privacy. While such data can be invaluable for rapid response and resource allocation, it is crucial to ensure that individuals’ data is anonymized and used only for the intended purpose.

Another critical issue is algorithmic bias, which can have profound social implications. ML models trained on historical data may inherit and amplify existing biases, leading to unequal treatment of different communities. For example, if a model is trained on data that disproportionately represents certain regions or populations, it may fail to accurately predict risks or allocate resources for underrepresented groups. This can result in increased vulnerability for marginalized communities, exacerbating existing inequalities. The paper "Taking Ethics, Fairness, and Bias Seriously in Machine Learning for Disaster Risk Management" [182] emphasizes the need for fairness-aware techniques and bias detection methods to ensure that ML models do not perpetuate or exacerbate social disparities. This is particularly important in earthquake risk assessment, where accurate predictions and equitable resource allocation can mean the difference between life and death.

Moreover, the potential for misinterpretation or misuse of predictive models poses significant ethical challenges. ML models, especially those with complex architectures, can be difficult to interpret, leading to a "black box" problem. This lack of transparency can result in mistrust among stakeholders, including emergency responders, policymakers, and affected communities. For instance, the paper "Explainable AI models for predicting liquefaction-induced lateral spreading" [17] underscores the importance of interpretability in critical applications such as geotechnical engineering and hazard assessment. Without transparency, there is a risk that models may be used in ways that are not aligned with the best interests of the public, leading to decisions that are not well-informed or even harmful.

In addition to these challenges, the deployment of ML in disaster management raises questions about accountability. Who is responsible when a model makes a prediction that leads to a negative outcome? The paper "The Ethical Risks of Analyzing Crisis Events on Social Media with Machine Learning" [121] highlights the ethical risks associated with automated analyses of crisis events, particularly the potential for harm if models are not properly validated or if their limitations are not clearly communicated. This underscores the need for robust evaluation frameworks and clear guidelines for the use of ML in high-stakes scenarios.

Furthermore, the use of ML in disaster management can have unintended social consequences. For example, the reliance on predictive models may lead to a reduction in the role of human judgment, potentially undermining the expertise of local communities and emergency responders. The paper "Machine Learning for Earthquake Risk and Impact Assessment" [106] emphasizes the importance of integrating domain knowledge and local expertise into ML models to ensure that they are not only technically sound but also socially relevant. This approach can help to build trust and ensure that models are aligned with the needs and values of the communities they serve.

Finally, the ethical and social implications of ML in disaster management also extend to the potential for misuse. Predictive models can be exploited for purposes other than their intended use, such as surveillance or political manipulation. The paper "Social Media Analytics in Disaster Response: A Comprehensive Review" [200] highlights the need for ethical considerations in the use of social media data, including the importance of transparency and the protection of user rights. This is particularly relevant in the context of earthquake risk assessment, where the misuse of data could have serious consequences for public safety and trust.

In conclusion, the ethical and social implications of using machine learning in disaster management, including earthquake risk and impact assessment, are complex and multifaceted. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates ethical frameworks, technical rigor, and community engagement. By prioritizing transparency, fairness, and accountability, we can ensure that ML models are used to enhance disaster management efforts in a responsible and equitable manner.

## 9 Challenges and Limitations in Applying Machine Learning to Earthquake Engineering

### 9.1 Data Scarcity and Quality

[207]

The application of machine learning (ML) in earthquake engineering is hindered by significant challenges related to data scarcity and quality. Seismic data, which is essential for training ML models, is often limited in both quantity and quality, making it difficult to develop robust and generalizable models. This is particularly problematic because the accuracy and reliability of ML models depend heavily on the availability of high-quality, representative data. The scarcity of seismic data is primarily due to the infrequency of earthquakes, the difficulty in collecting data from remote or inaccessible regions, and the limitations of traditional seismic monitoring systems. As a result, the training of ML models for earthquake prediction and analysis is constrained, leading to suboptimal performance and limited generalizability. 

One of the primary challenges in seismic data collection is the limited number of seismic events that occur with sufficient magnitude and frequency to provide meaningful training data. Earthquakes are rare events, and the occurrence of large, damaging earthquakes is even rarer. This scarcity makes it difficult to train ML models to recognize and predict seismic patterns accurately. Moreover, the data collected from seismic events is often incomplete, noisy, or inconsistent, which further complicates the training process. For example, the paper titled "Data-Driven Prediction of Seismic Intensity Distributions Featuring Hybrid Classification-Regression Models" highlights the challenges of using sparse data to develop accurate models for predicting seismic intensity distributions [8]. The authors note that the limited availability of high-quality seismic data poses significant challenges for developing models that can reliably predict seismic intensity distributions.

Another major issue is the quality of the seismic data available. Seismic data is often collected from a limited number of seismic stations, which may not be distributed evenly across different regions. This uneven distribution can lead to biased datasets that do not accurately represent the seismic activity in all areas. Additionally, the data collected from seismic stations may be affected by various sources of noise, such as environmental factors, sensor malfunctions, and interference from human activities. These issues can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of ML models trained on such data. For instance, the paper "QuakeSet: A Dataset and Low-Resource Models to Monitor Earthquakes through Sentinel-1" discusses the challenges of using satellite data for earthquake monitoring and highlights the importance of high-quality, reliable data for training ML models [90]. The authors note that the quality of the data used in their models is crucial for achieving accurate predictions and reliable results.

The limited availability of high-quality seismic data also poses challenges for the development of ML models that can generalize well across different regions and seismic conditions. ML models trained on data from one region may not perform well when applied to data from another region due to differences in seismic activity, geological conditions, and sensor configurations. This is a significant limitation, as earthquake engineering requires models that can accurately predict seismic behavior in a wide range of environments. The paper "Generalized Neural Networks for Real-Time Earthquake Early Warning" addresses this issue by proposing a data recombination method to create generalized earthquake scenarios for training ML models [22]. The authors emphasize the importance of using diverse and representative data to improve the generalizability of ML models for earthquake prediction.

In addition to data scarcity and quality, the sparsity of seismic data is another critical challenge. Sparse data refers to datasets that have a limited number of samples, which can make it difficult to train ML models that require large amounts of data to achieve high accuracy and robustness. The paper "Machine learning based surrogate modeling with SVD enabled training for nonlinear civil structures subject to dynamic loading" highlights the challenges of using sparse data to train surrogate models for seismic response prediction [166]. The authors note that the sparsity of seismic data limits the ability of ML models to capture the complex relationships between input parameters and seismic responses, leading to suboptimal performance.

To address these challenges, researchers have explored various data augmentation techniques to increase the availability and quality of seismic data. Data augmentation involves generating synthetic data or modifying existing data to create more diverse and representative datasets. This approach can help improve the performance of ML models by providing them with more training data and reducing the impact of sparse data. The paper "QuakeSet: A Dataset and Low-Resource Models to Monitor Earthquakes through Sentinel-1" discusses the use of satellite data to augment seismic datasets and improve the accuracy of earthquake monitoring systems [90]. The authors propose a series of traditional machine learning and deep learning models as baselines to assess the effectiveness of ML-based models in earthquake analysis, highlighting the importance of data augmentation in improving model performance.

Despite the challenges posed by data scarcity and quality, the development of ML models for earthquake engineering remains a critical area of research. Addressing these challenges requires a combination of improved data collection strategies, advanced data augmentation techniques, and the integration of domain-specific knowledge into ML models. The paper "Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Seismic Response Prediction of Nonlinear Steel Moment Resisting Frame Structures" emphasizes the importance of incorporating physical laws and domain knowledge into ML models to enhance their accuracy and reliability [7]. The authors propose a physics-informed ML method that integrates scientific principles and physical laws into deep neural networks for modeling seismic responses of nonlinear structures, demonstrating the potential of hybrid approaches to overcome data limitations.

In conclusion, the challenges of data scarcity and quality in earthquake engineering significantly impact the development and performance of ML models. The limited availability of high-quality seismic data, the difficulty in collecting data from remote areas, and the presence of noise and inconsistencies in the data all contribute to the challenges of training robust and generalizable ML models. Addressing these challenges requires a combination of data augmentation techniques, improved data collection strategies, and the integration of domain-specific knowledge into ML models. By overcoming these challenges, researchers can develop more accurate and reliable ML models for earthquake prediction and analysis, ultimately contributing to improved earthquake preparedness and risk mitigation. The paper "Data-Driven Prediction of Seismic Intensity Distributions Featuring Hybrid Classification-Regression Models" highlights the importance of addressing data scarcity and quality to develop accurate models for seismic intensity distribution prediction [8]. The authors' work underscores the need for continued research and innovation in the field of earthquake engineering to overcome these challenges and improve the effectiveness of ML models in earthquake prediction and analysis.

### 9.2 Model Generalization and Out-of-Distribution Performance

## 9.2 Model Generalization and Out-of-Distribution Performance

One of the most significant challenges in applying machine learning (ML) to earthquake engineering is ensuring that models generalize well to unseen seismic data or different geographical regions. Seismic data is inherently complex and variable, with differences in geological conditions, fault mechanisms, and seismic wave propagation characteristics across regions. This variability poses a major hurdle for ML models, which are typically trained on specific datasets that may not represent the full spectrum of possible seismic scenarios. As a result, models trained on data from one region may perform poorly when applied to another, due to differences in subsurface structures, soil properties, or local seismic wave propagation characteristics. For instance, a model trained on data from a region with a high density of seismic stations may struggle to generalize to areas with sparse data coverage, as the model may not have encountered the types of noise or missing data that are common in such scenarios [75].

The limitations of current ML models in handling out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios are further exacerbated by the rarity of extreme seismic events. Earthquakes are infrequent, and the data available for training models often consists of a limited number of events, which may not capture the full range of possible seismic behaviors. This scarcity of data leads to models that are biased toward the training data and may fail to generalize well to new or rare scenarios. For example, a model trained on data from moderate earthquakes may not perform well in predicting the behavior of larger, more complex events, as it has not been exposed to such scenarios during training [10]. This is particularly problematic in earthquake engineering, where the ability to predict extreme events can have life-saving implications.

Another critical issue is the presence of spatial and temporal dependencies in seismic data. Seismic waves propagate through the Earth in complex ways, and their behavior is influenced by factors such as the geological structure of the subsurface, the type of soil, and the depth of the earthquake's focus. Traditional ML models, especially those based on deep learning, often struggle to capture these complex dependencies, as they may not explicitly incorporate the physical principles governing wave propagation. For instance, a model trained on data from a single seismic station may not generalize well to data from multiple stations, as it may not account for the spatial correlation between different stations or the varying characteristics of seismic waves at different locations [75]. This limitation underscores the need for models that integrate physical knowledge into their architecture, such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which can enforce physical constraints and improve generalization [7].

The challenges of model generalization are further compounded by the fact that seismic data is often noisy and incomplete. In real-world applications, seismic stations may experience data loss due to equipment failures, environmental interference, or communication issues, resulting in incomplete or corrupted datasets. ML models trained on such data may struggle to make accurate predictions when faced with similar data in the future. For example, a model trained on data with a high signal-to-noise ratio may fail when applied to data with lower quality, as it may not have learned to distinguish between signal and noise effectively [13]. This highlights the importance of developing models that can handle noisy and incomplete data, such as those based on Bayesian neural networks or other uncertainty-aware methods that can quantify the reliability of predictions [208].

In addition to these technical challenges, there are also practical limitations in the availability of diverse and representative datasets for training ML models. Most seismic datasets are collected from specific regions or time periods, and they may not include a wide range of seismic events, including foreshocks, mainshocks, and aftershocks. This lack of diversity can lead to models that are overly confident in their predictions but fail to generalize well to new or unseen scenarios. For instance, a model trained on data from a specific fault system may not perform well when applied to a different fault system with different characteristics [10]. This suggests that future efforts should focus on developing more comprehensive datasets that capture a broader range of seismic events and conditions.

Another issue is the difficulty of evaluating model performance in out-of-distribution scenarios. Traditional evaluation metrics, such as accuracy and mean squared error, are often based on data that is similar to the training set. However, these metrics may not be reliable when applied to data that is significantly different from the training data. This makes it challenging to assess the true performance of ML models in real-world applications, where the data may not conform to the assumptions made during training. For example, a model that performs well on a validation set may fail to generalize to new data, as it may not have learned the underlying patterns that are consistent across different regions and events [8].

To address these challenges, researchers are exploring various strategies to improve model generalization and out-of-distribution performance. One approach is to use transfer learning, where a model trained on a large dataset is fine-tuned on a smaller, more specific dataset. This can help the model leverage knowledge from a broader range of data and improve its ability to generalize to new scenarios [95]. Another approach is to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into the model architecture, such as physics-informed neural networks, which can enforce physical constraints and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data [7]. Additionally, researchers are investigating methods for data augmentation, where synthetic data is generated to supplement the training data and improve the model's robustness to variations in the input [209].

In summary, the challenge of model generalization and out-of-distribution performance is a critical issue in applying machine learning to earthquake engineering. The variability of seismic data, the scarcity of extreme events, and the presence of noise and incompleteness in the data all contribute to the difficulty of developing models that perform well in unseen scenarios. Addressing these challenges requires a combination of techniques, including the integration of physical knowledge, the use of transfer learning, and the development of more comprehensive datasets. By improving the generalization capabilities of ML models, researchers can enhance their reliability and effectiveness in real-world earthquake engineering applications.

### 9.3 Interpretability and Explainability

Interpretability and explainability are critical challenges in applying machine learning (ML) to earthquake engineering, particularly in high-stakes applications such as earthquake prediction and structural health monitoring. Unlike traditional engineering models, which are often based on well-established physical laws and empirical relationships, ML models, especially deep learning architectures, are frequently treated as "black boxes." This opacity can hinder trust in their predictions and limit their adoption in critical decision-making processes. In earthquake engineering, where the consequences of incorrect predictions or misdiagnosed structural damage can be catastrophic, the need for interpretable and explainable models is paramount. 

One of the key issues is that many ML models, particularly deep neural networks, operate in high-dimensional spaces with complex, non-linear transformations that are difficult to trace back to the original input features. This makes it challenging to understand how a model arrives at a particular prediction, especially when the model is used for tasks such as earthquake detection, seismic phase picking, or structural damage assessment. For instance, a deep learning model trained to detect seismic events may accurately classify a signal as an earthquake, but without a clear explanation of which features contributed to this decision, engineers and seismologists cannot validate the model’s reasoning or ensure its reliability in real-world scenarios. This limitation is especially problematic when dealing with rare or extreme events, where the model’s decisions could have far-reaching implications.

The importance of interpretability is further underscored by the need for informed decision-making in earthquake engineering. Structural health monitoring systems, for example, rely on accurate and reliable predictions to assess the integrity of critical infrastructure such as bridges and buildings. In such applications, a model that cannot explain its predictions may be perceived as untrustworthy, even if it performs well in terms of accuracy. The lack of transparency can also make it difficult to identify and correct biases or errors in the model’s training data, leading to potential misclassifications or false alarms. This is a significant concern, as even small errors in seismic signal detection or structural damage identification can result in costly and potentially dangerous outcomes.

Several studies have highlighted the need for explainable AI (XAI) in earthquake engineering. For example, in the work on "Explainable AI models for predicting liquefaction-induced lateral spreading," researchers used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model for predicting lateral spreading in liquefied soils. The study demonstrated that SHAP analysis can reveal the key factors driving the model’s predictions, such as soil characteristics derived from Cone Penetration Test (CPT) data, which aligns with established engineering knowledge [17]. This level of interpretability not only enhances transparency but also allows for comparisons with traditional engineering practices, fostering greater trust in the model’s outputs.

Similarly, in the context of structural health monitoring, the "Glass-box model representation of seismic failure mode prediction for conventional RC shear walls" paper proposed a Decision Tree (DT) model as an interpretable alternative to complex black-box models. The study showed that while deep learning models may offer higher accuracy, they lack the interpretability needed for engineering decision-making. The DT model, on the other hand, provided clear insights into how input features such as compressive strength of concrete and wall aspect ratio influenced the predicted failure modes. This level of transparency is essential for engineers who need to understand the underlying factors contributing to structural vulnerabilities and make informed decisions about retrofitting or maintenance [4].

Another important aspect of interpretability is the ability to understand and address model limitations. In the "Winning with Simple Learning Models Detecting Earthquakes in Groningen, the Netherlands" paper, researchers demonstrated that simpler models, such as logistic regression, could achieve comparable performance to deep learning models in detecting low-magnitude earthquakes. The study emphasized that simpler models not only require fewer resources for training and deployment but also offer greater interpretability, as their decision-making processes are easier to trace and validate. This is particularly relevant in earthquake engineering, where the ability to understand and improve model performance is crucial for long-term reliability and adaptability [210].

The challenge of interpretability is further compounded by the inherent complexity of seismic data. Seismic signals are often noisy, non-stationary, and affected by a wide range of environmental factors, making it difficult to isolate meaningful patterns. In such cases, models that are both accurate and interpretable are essential for distinguishing between genuine seismic events and spurious signals. For instance, the "Shapelets for earthquake detection" paper introduced a time-series shape-based approach that not only improved the detection of seismic events but also provided insights into the underlying patterns that distinguish earthquakes from other seismic activities. The use of shapelets, which are time-series subsequences with discriminative properties, allowed the model to highlight key features that contributed to its predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability [211].

In addition to improving trust and decision-making, interpretability is also a key factor in the development of hybrid models that combine machine learning with physics-based knowledge. The "Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction" paper, for example, demonstrated how incorporating physical constraints into deep learning models could enhance both accuracy and interpretability. By ensuring that the model’s outputs adhered to known physical laws, the researchers were able to provide more reliable predictions while also offering insights into the underlying mechanisms of fault friction. This approach not only improved the model’s performance but also made its predictions more transparent and actionable for engineers and seismologists [10].

Overall, the challenge of interpretability and explainability in machine learning for earthquake engineering cannot be overstated. While deep learning models have shown great promise in improving the accuracy of seismic predictions and structural assessments, their "black-box" nature remains a significant barrier to their widespread adoption. To address this, researchers must continue to explore and develop techniques that enhance model transparency, such as SHAP, decision trees, and physics-informed architectures. By doing so, they can build models that not only perform well but also provide the insights and explanations necessary for informed decision-making in earthquake engineering.

### 9.4 Computational Efficiency and Scalability

The high computational demands of training and deploying complex machine learning models in real-time seismic monitoring systems pose a significant challenge in the field of earthquake engineering. Real-time seismic monitoring requires the rapid processing of large volumes of data, often in the order of terabytes, which demands not only powerful algorithms but also efficient hardware. The computational complexity of training deep learning models, which often involve multiple layers and extensive parameter tuning, can be prohibitively high. Moreover, deploying these models in real-time systems necessitates not just speed but also the ability to handle dynamic and evolving data streams, which further complicates the computational landscape [5; 5].

One of the key challenges is the balance between model accuracy and computational efficiency. While deep learning models can achieve high accuracy in tasks such as earthquake detection and prediction, they often require substantial computational resources. For instance, models like CNNs, RNNs, and GANs, which have been shown to be effective in seismic data analysis and processing, are computationally intensive. The training of these models can take hours or even days, depending on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the model architecture [14; 20]. This makes it difficult to deploy such models in real-time systems, where quick decision-making is critical.

The need for efficient algorithms and hardware to support real-time applications is therefore paramount. Traditional computing architectures, such as CPUs, may not be sufficient to handle the computational load imposed by these models. Instead, specialized hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs, is often required to accelerate the training and inference processes. For example, the use of GPUs has been shown to significantly reduce the training time of deep learning models, making them more feasible for real-time applications [5; 5]. However, the cost and availability of such hardware can be a limiting factor, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

In addition to hardware considerations, the design of efficient algorithms is crucial. Techniques such as model compression, quantization, and pruning can help reduce the computational footprint of machine learning models without sacrificing too much accuracy. These methods aim to simplify the model architecture or reduce the precision of the parameters, thereby making the models more lightweight and faster to execute. For instance, the use of quantization, which reduces the number of bits used to represent the model's weights, has been shown to significantly decrease the memory requirements and improve inference speed [5; 5]. Similarly, model pruning, which involves removing redundant or less important parameters, can lead to more efficient models that require fewer computational resources.

Another approach to improving computational efficiency is the use of parallel computing and distributed systems. By leveraging the power of multiple processors or nodes, it is possible to distribute the computational load and accelerate the training and inference processes. For example, the use of Spark for parallel computation of PDFs on big spatial data has been shown to significantly reduce the execution time compared to traditional methods [212]. This approach can be particularly useful for handling large-scale seismic data, which often involves processing vast amounts of information from multiple sources.

The integration of machine learning with physics-based models also presents opportunities for improving computational efficiency. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which incorporate physical laws and domain knowledge into the training process, can help reduce the need for extensive data by leveraging existing scientific understanding [10]. This can lead to more efficient models that require less training data and computational resources. Furthermore, hybrid models that combine machine learning with traditional physics-based simulations can provide a balance between accuracy and efficiency, making them suitable for real-time applications.

Despite these advancements, the computational demands of machine learning models in earthquake engineering remain a significant challenge. The complexity of seismic data, which often involves high-dimensional time-series information and spatial dependencies, adds to the difficulty of developing efficient models. For instance, the use of deep learning for seismic inversion and imaging requires processing large volumes of data, which can be computationally expensive [82]. Techniques such as data augmentation and synthetic data generation can help mitigate this issue by providing more training data, but they also add to the computational burden.

Efforts to improve computational efficiency and scalability are ongoing, with researchers exploring novel architectures and optimization techniques. For example, the development of lightweight deep learning models, such as mobile neural networks, aims to reduce the computational requirements while maintaining performance [5; 5]. Additionally, the use of edge computing, where data processing is performed at the source rather than in centralized data centers, can help reduce latency and improve real-time performance [5; 5].

In conclusion, the computational efficiency and scalability of machine learning models in earthquake engineering are critical factors that must be addressed to enable real-time applications. While significant progress has been made in developing efficient algorithms and leveraging specialized hardware, further research is needed to overcome the challenges associated with high computational demands. By continuing to innovate and optimize machine learning models, the field of earthquake engineering can benefit from more efficient and scalable solutions that support real-time seismic monitoring and early warning systems.

### 9.5 Underspecification and Model Reliability

## 9.1 Underspecification and Model Reliability

Underspecification is a critical concept in machine learning (ML) that refers to the phenomenon where multiple models can achieve similar performance on a given in-domain task, but exhibit divergent behaviors when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. This issue is particularly relevant in earthquake engineering, where the ability of ML models to generalize across different seismic regions, fault systems, and environmental conditions is crucial for reliable predictions and decision-making. The problem of underspecification underscores the limitations of relying solely on in-domain performance metrics to evaluate model reliability, as models that perform well on training data may fail when exposed to new, unseen data. Addressing this issue is essential for ensuring the robustness and practical applicability of ML models in earthquake engineering.

In the context of earthquake engineering, underspecification can have significant implications for tasks such as earthquake detection, seismic hazard assessment, and structural health monitoring. For instance, a deep learning model trained to detect seismic events in a specific region may exhibit high accuracy on the training data but fail to generalize to other regions with different geological characteristics or sensor configurations. This variability in out-of-distribution performance raises concerns about the reliability of ML models in real-world applications, where data distributions can vary substantially over time and space. The challenge of underspecification is further exacerbated by the scarcity of high-quality, labeled seismic data, which limits the ability of models to learn robust and generalizable representations of seismic phenomena.

Several studies have highlighted the issue of underspecification in seismic ML applications. One notable example is the work by [15], which explores the use of deep learning models for earthquake monitoring. While the models show promising in-domain performance, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a challenge, demonstrating the need for careful evaluation of model reliability. Another study, [10], investigates the integration of physics-based constraints into deep learning models to improve their reliability. The authors propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that incorporates the governing equations of fault friction into the model training process. By embedding physical laws into the learning framework, the model is able to produce more consistent and interpretable predictions, even in the presence of data variability. This approach demonstrates how integrating domain knowledge can help address the issue of underspecification by reducing the number of possible model configurations that are compatible with the physical constraints of the system.

The concept of underspecification is also closely related to the challenge of model interpretability in earthquake engineering. In many cases, the decision-making process of ML models, especially deep learning models, is opaque, making it difficult to understand why a model produces certain predictions. This lack of transparency can further exacerbate the problem of underspecification, as it becomes challenging to identify the sources of variation in model behavior across different data distributions. For example, in the study [4], the authors propose a decision tree-based model that provides interpretable predictions of seismic failure modes. By using a glass-box model, the authors are able to gain insights into the factors that influence the model's predictions, which can help identify potential issues related to underspecification.

In addition to the above, the issue of underspecification has been extensively discussed in the context of seismic data analysis. [75] highlights the challenges of training deep learning models on single-station ground motion records, which are often characterized by high levels of noise and limited temporal resolution. The study finds that deep learning models trained on such data can exhibit significant variability in their performance, even when evaluated on the same dataset. This variability in performance suggests that the models may not be capturing the underlying patterns in the data consistently, leading to potential issues with out-of-distribution generalization.

The problem of underspecification is also relevant to the application of ML in structural health monitoring. [166] introduces a surrogate modeling framework that combines machine learning with singular value decomposition (SVD) to predict the response of nonlinear structures under dynamic loading. While the framework demonstrates good performance on the training data, the study also notes that the models may not generalize well to new, unseen structures or loading conditions. This highlights the need for rigorous validation and testing of ML models in structural health monitoring applications to ensure that they can reliably detect damage and predict structural behavior in diverse scenarios.

Addressing the issue of underspecification requires a multifaceted approach that includes both methodological and practical considerations. One promising direction is the use of model ensembles, where multiple models are trained and combined to improve the reliability of predictions. By aggregating the outputs of multiple models, ensemble methods can help reduce the impact of underspecification by leveraging the diversity of model behaviors. [31] explores the use of a hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) algorithm for detecting seismic waves, which is designed to be robust to noise and variations in data distribution. The study demonstrates that the HTM algorithm can effectively distinguish between normal and anomalous seismic signals, even in the presence of significant noise, suggesting that such approaches may be more resilient to the challenges posed by underspecification.

Another approach to improving model reliability is the use of transfer learning, which involves training models on data from related tasks or domains and then fine-tuning them for specific applications. [95] discusses the potential of transfer learning in seismic data analysis, particularly for tasks where labeled data is scarce. By leveraging knowledge from related domains, transfer learning can help reduce the risk of underspecification by providing models with a broader range of data to learn from. This is especially valuable in earthquake engineering, where the availability of labeled seismic data is often limited due to the rarity of large earthquakes and the high cost of data collection.

In summary, the issue of underspecification poses a significant challenge to the reliability of ML models in earthquake engineering. The ability of multiple models to achieve similar in-domain performance while exhibiting different out-of-distribution behavior underscores the need for careful evaluation and validation of ML models in real-world applications. Addressing this issue requires a combination of methodological innovations, such as the integration of physics-based constraints and the use of ensemble methods, as well as practical considerations, such as the use of transfer learning to improve model generalizability. By taking these steps, the earthquake engineering community can enhance the reliability and applicability of ML models in critical tasks such as earthquake detection, seismic hazard assessment, and structural health monitoring.

### 9.6 Data-Model Inefficiencies and Negative Externalities

9.6 Data-Model Inefficiencies and Negative Externalities

Data-model inefficiencies and negative externalities represent a critical challenge in the application of machine learning (ML) to earthquake engineering. These issues arise when the addition of certain data sources to a training dataset inadvertently degrades the performance of the model on key subgroups. Negative data externalities refer to situations where the inclusion of specific data, which may appear beneficial at first glance, leads to a decline in the model's ability to generalize or perform accurately on specific subsets of the data. This phenomenon is particularly relevant in earthquake engineering, where the complexity of seismic data and the diversity of geological conditions can significantly influence model performance.

One of the primary reasons for the emergence of negative data externalities is the presence of biases or inconsistencies in the data. For example, a model trained on a dataset that includes a disproportionate number of seismic events from a specific region may perform poorly when applied to a different region with distinct geological characteristics. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that earthquake data is often sparse and unevenly distributed, leading to a lack of representation for certain subgroups. A study by [213] highlights how the use of data from specific geological contexts can lead to models that are overly specialized, thus reducing their generalizability to other regions.

The implications of negative data externalities are significant for the design of effective and equitable ML systems in earthquake engineering. When models are trained on biased or unrepresentative data, they may fail to capture the underlying patterns and relationships that are critical for accurate prediction and decision-making. For instance, a model that is trained primarily on data from areas with high seismic activity may not perform well in regions with lower activity, leading to inaccurate predictions and potentially dangerous consequences. This challenge is compounded by the fact that the quality and consistency of seismic data can vary widely, depending on factors such as the location, sensor technology, and data collection methods.

To address these inefficiencies, it is essential to adopt a more nuanced approach to data selection and model training. One strategy is to carefully curate datasets to ensure a balanced representation of different geological conditions and seismic events. This involves not only selecting data from a diverse set of sources but also ensuring that the data is representative of the target application. For example, [101] discusses the importance of using high-quality, well-labeled data to train models that can accurately localize noise in seismic data, highlighting the need for careful data curation to avoid the pitfalls of negative data externalities.

Another critical consideration is the need for robust evaluation metrics that can capture the performance of models across different subgroups. Traditional metrics such as accuracy or F1-score may not be sufficient to detect the subtle differences in performance that arise from negative data externalities. Instead, more sophisticated evaluation techniques, such as subgroup analysis and fairness-aware metrics, should be employed to ensure that models are not only effective overall but also equitable across different regions and conditions. [105] emphasizes the importance of evaluating models not only on their ability to denoise data but also on their capacity to maintain accuracy across a wide range of seismic conditions.

Furthermore, the integration of domain knowledge into the ML pipeline can help mitigate the effects of negative data externalities. By incorporating physical principles and geological insights into the model training process, it is possible to constrain the model's predictions to more realistic and physically meaningful outcomes. This approach, as discussed in [7], can help ensure that the model remains robust and generalizable, even when faced with data from diverse and challenging environments.

The issue of negative data externalities also highlights the importance of continuous model monitoring and updating. As new data becomes available, it is crucial to reassess the performance of existing models and make necessary adjustments to maintain their accuracy and reliability. This is particularly important in earthquake engineering, where the characteristics of seismic events can change over time due to factors such as tectonic activity and environmental changes. [62] illustrates how the use of deep learning models can lead to significant improvements in noise attenuation, but it also underscores the need for ongoing evaluation and refinement to ensure that models remain effective in the face of evolving data conditions.

In addition to these technical considerations, there is a broader need for interdisciplinary collaboration to address the challenges posed by data-model inefficiencies and negative externalities. Earthquake engineering is a complex field that involves multiple domains, including geophysics, structural engineering, and computer science. By fostering collaboration between these disciplines, it is possible to develop more comprehensive and effective solutions that account for the diverse challenges of seismic data and model performance. [214] highlights the potential of such interdisciplinary approaches in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of ML models for structural health monitoring.

In conclusion, the phenomenon of negative data externalities presents a significant challenge in the application of ML to earthquake engineering. By carefully curating datasets, employing robust evaluation metrics, integrating domain knowledge, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, it is possible to design more effective and equitable ML systems that can accurately capture the complex and diverse nature of seismic data. Addressing these challenges is essential for the continued advancement of ML in earthquake engineering, ensuring that models are not only accurate but also fair and reliable across different contexts and conditions. [125] underscores the importance of these considerations in the broader context of applying ML to complex scientific and engineering problems, emphasizing the need for a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to model development and evaluation.

### 9.7 Model Adaptation and Domain Shifts

The application of machine learning (ML) in earthquake engineering faces significant challenges when adapting models to new or changing environments, such as different geological conditions or updated sensor technologies. Earthquake engineering is inherently complex due to the variability of seismic events, spatial heterogeneity of the Earth's crust, and the diverse characteristics of seismic data collected from different regions. These factors contribute to domain shifts, which occur when the distribution of data changes between the training and deployment phases. As a result, models trained on data from one region or under specific sensor configurations may fail to generalize effectively to new conditions, leading to reduced accuracy and reliability. Addressing this challenge requires robust adaptation techniques that enable models to maintain performance across diverse and evolving scenarios.

One of the primary challenges in model adaptation is the variability in data characteristics across different seismic regions. For instance, the seismic waveforms recorded in Japan may differ significantly from those in California due to differences in geological structures, tectonic settings, and sensor configurations. A model trained on Japanese data may not perform well in California without adjustments, as the underlying patterns and relationships in the data can vary substantially [22]. This highlights the need for domain adaptation techniques that can account for such variations and improve the model's generalization capabilities. Transfer learning, for example, has been shown to be effective in overcoming data scarcity and improving model performance in new domains [103]. By leveraging knowledge learned from one domain (e.g., Japan) and applying it to another (e.g., California), transfer learning can help bridge the gap between different geological conditions.

Another critical factor affecting model adaptation is the evolution of sensor technologies. As sensor networks become more advanced and widely deployed, the data collected can change in terms of resolution, sampling rates, and noise characteristics. For example, newer seismic sensors may capture higher-frequency components of seismic waves that were previously unmeasurable, leading to a shift in the data distribution [5]. If a model is trained on data from older sensors, it may not perform well when deployed with new sensors, as the input features and signal characteristics have changed. This necessitates the development of adaptation techniques that can handle such changes and maintain model performance. One approach is to retrain the model periodically using data from the updated sensors, ensuring that it remains aligned with the new data distribution [14].

Furthermore, the dynamic nature of seismic environments introduces additional challenges for model adaptation. Seismic activity can vary significantly over time, with changes in the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes affecting the data patterns. For example, a region that was previously seismically quiet may experience increased seismic activity due to human-induced factors such as fluid injection or mining operations. In such cases, models trained on historical data may not be able to accurately predict future events, as the underlying patterns have shifted. To address this, models need to be continuously updated and adapted to reflect the evolving seismic environment. This can be achieved through online learning techniques, where the model is updated incrementally as new data becomes available [16].

Another important aspect of model adaptation is the need to handle imbalanced and heterogeneous data. Seismic data can be highly imbalanced, with a large number of non-earthquake signals (e.g., noise, human activities) and a relatively small number of earthquake events. This imbalance can lead to biased models that perform poorly on the minority class (earthquake events). Additionally, the data may be collected from multiple sources with different characteristics, such as different sensor types, sampling rates, and noise levels. This heterogeneity can further complicate the adaptation process, as the model needs to be robust to variations in the input data. Techniques such as data augmentation and synthetic data generation can help address these challenges by increasing the diversity of the training data and improving the model's ability to generalize [23].

Moreover, the complexity of seismic data and the high dimensionality of the input features pose additional challenges for model adaptation. Seismic data typically consists of time-series signals with multiple components (e.g., horizontal and vertical components), and the relationships between these components can vary significantly across different regions and sensor configurations. This complexity can make it difficult for models to learn the underlying patterns and generalize to new conditions. To overcome this, models need to be designed with sufficient capacity to capture the intricate relationships in the data while maintaining computational efficiency. Techniques such as feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and model pruning can help improve the model's adaptability and efficiency [26].

In summary, model adaptation and domain shifts are critical challenges in applying machine learning to earthquake engineering. The variability in seismic data, the evolution of sensor technologies, and the dynamic nature of seismic environments all contribute to the need for robust adaptation techniques. By leveraging transfer learning, online learning, data augmentation, and advanced modeling approaches, researchers can improve the generalization and adaptability of ML models in earthquake engineering applications. These techniques are essential for ensuring that models remain effective and reliable as they are deployed in new and changing environments. As the field continues to evolve, further research into domain adaptation and model generalization will be crucial for advancing the application of machine learning in earthquake engineering.

### 9.8 Limitations of Current Evaluation Metrics

[18]

Traditional evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) are commonly used in machine learning applications to assess model performance. However, these metrics are not always sufficient to capture the true performance and reliability of machine learning models in the specific context of earthquake engineering. The unique challenges in this domain, such as data scarcity, high variability in seismic signals, and the need for high confidence in predictions, necessitate the development of more comprehensive and domain-specific evaluation frameworks. Critically assessing the limitations of current evaluation metrics is essential to understanding the gaps in existing approaches and guiding the development of more robust methodologies.

One of the primary limitations of traditional evaluation metrics is their inability to account for the temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in seismic data. For example, in structural health monitoring (SHM), the prediction of damage in a structure is often based on time-series data that exhibit complex temporal patterns. Metrics such as accuracy and F1-score, which are typically computed on static datasets, may not adequately reflect the model's ability to capture these dynamic patterns. This issue is particularly relevant in the context of deep learning models, which are designed to exploit temporal dependencies in data. As noted in several studies, the use of such metrics may lead to an overestimation of model performance, as they do not account for the sequential nature of the data [112].

Another limitation is the assumption of balanced datasets, which is often not the case in earthquake engineering applications. Seismic datasets are typically imbalanced, with a much higher prevalence of undamaged samples compared to damaged ones. This imbalance can significantly affect the performance of traditional evaluation metrics. For instance, a model that always predicts the majority class (undamaged) may achieve high accuracy but fail to detect actual damage, which is critical in SHM applications. This issue is well-documented in the literature, where it is highlighted that metrics such as precision and recall are more appropriate in imbalanced settings. However, even these metrics may not fully capture the nuances of the problem, especially when the cost of false negatives (undetected damage) is extremely high [42].

Moreover, traditional evaluation metrics often fail to account for the uncertainty and variability in seismic data. Seismic signals are inherently noisy and can be affected by a wide range of factors, including environmental conditions, sensor calibration, and data transmission errors. This variability can lead to significant fluctuations in model performance, making it difficult to assess the true reliability of a model. In this context, the use of probabilistic metrics, such as Bayesian uncertainty estimates, can provide a more comprehensive assessment of model performance. For example, in the case of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), the uncertainty associated with predictions can be quantified, providing valuable insights into the reliability of the model [215].

The limitations of traditional evaluation metrics are further exacerbated by the need for domain-specific evaluation frameworks that account for the unique characteristics of earthquake engineering applications. For instance, in the context of seismic risk assessment, the evaluation of models must consider not only the accuracy of predictions but also the potential consequences of errors. This is particularly important in applications where the cost of false positives (unnecessary interventions) or false negatives (missed damage) can have significant financial and safety implications. Traditional metrics such as accuracy may not capture these trade-offs effectively. Instead, domain-specific metrics that incorporate risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis are needed to provide a more holistic evaluation of model performance [106].

Furthermore, the evaluation of machine learning models in earthquake engineering often requires the use of real-world data, which can be challenging to obtain and process. The availability of high-quality, labeled seismic data is limited, and the data may be affected by noise, missing values, and other forms of corruption. This makes it difficult to validate the performance of models using traditional evaluation metrics, which often rely on clean and complete datasets. In this context, the use of synthetic data generation techniques, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), can help overcome some of these limitations by providing additional training data. However, the evaluation of models trained on synthetic data remains an open challenge, as traditional metrics may not be sufficient to assess the quality of the generated data [216].

In addition, the evaluation of machine learning models in earthquake engineering must take into account the computational and practical constraints of real-time applications. Many traditional evaluation metrics are computationally intensive and may not be suitable for deployment in real-time monitoring systems. This is particularly relevant in the context of edge-AI and real-time data processing, where the model must make predictions with minimal latency. In such scenarios, the use of lightweight and efficient evaluation metrics is essential to ensure that the model can operate effectively in real-world conditions. However, traditional metrics may not be optimized for these constraints, leading to a mismatch between the evaluation process and the practical requirements of the application [41].

Finally, the evaluation of machine learning models in earthquake engineering must also consider the interpretability and explainability of the models. Traditional metrics focus on the performance of the model in terms of accuracy and other quantitative measures, but they do not provide insights into how the model arrives at its predictions. This is a critical issue in applications where the model's decisions must be understood and trusted by human experts. In this context, the use of explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and SHAP values, can provide valuable insights into the model's behavior. However, the integration of these techniques into traditional evaluation frameworks remains an open research challenge [217].

In conclusion, while traditional evaluation metrics have been widely used in machine learning applications, they are not always sufficient to capture the true performance and reliability of models in the context of earthquake engineering. The limitations of these metrics, including their inability to account for temporal and spatial dependencies, imbalanced datasets, and domain-specific requirements, highlight the need for more comprehensive and domain-specific evaluation frameworks. The development of such frameworks is essential to ensure that machine learning models can be effectively applied to real-world earthquake engineering problems.

### 9.9 Integration with Physics-Based Models

## 1. Introduction

The integration of machine learning (ML) with physics-based models presents a transformative opportunity in earthquake engineering, where the complexity of seismic phenomena necessitates both data-driven insights and fundamental physical principles. This subsection delves into the challenges and intricacies of this integration, highlighting issues of consistency, interpretability, and the validation of hybrid approaches. By drawing on insights from the provided papers, we underscore the critical need for interdisciplinary collaboration to address these challenges and unlock the full potential of ML in earthquake engineering.

One of the primary challenges in integrating ML with physics-based models is ensuring consistency between the two approaches. Physics-based models are grounded in well-established principles, such as the laws of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, which are crucial for accurately simulating physical systems. In contrast, ML models, while powerful in capturing complex patterns, often lack explicit adherence to these physical laws. This discrepancy can lead to predictions that are statistically robust but physically implausible. For example, the work by [47] highlights the importance of embedding physical constraints into ML models to ensure that predictions align with the underlying physics. This is particularly crucial in earthquake engineering, where the accuracy of predictions can have significant implications for safety and infrastructure resilience.

Interpretability is another critical challenge in the integration of ML with physics-based models. While ML models can achieve high accuracy, their "black-box" nature often makes it difficult to understand how they arrive at their predictions. This lack of transparency can be a significant barrier in domains where interpretability is essential, such as in the assessment of structural health or the prediction of seismic risks. The paper [49] emphasizes the need for models that can not only make accurate predictions but also provide insights into the underlying physical processes. In earthquake engineering, this is vital for building trust in ML models and enabling informed decision-making by engineers and policymakers.

Validation of hybrid approaches is another major challenge. The integration of ML and physics-based models often involves complex interactions that are difficult to validate. Traditional validation methods, which are typically designed for either purely data-driven or purely physics-based models, may not be sufficient for hybrid approaches. The paper [47] discusses the need for new validation frameworks that can account for the unique characteristics of hybrid models. This is particularly important in earthquake engineering, where the stakes are high, and any errors in predictions can have severe consequences.

Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to address these challenges and ensure the effective integration of ML with physics-based models. The complexity of seismic phenomena requires a multidisciplinary approach, combining expertise from fields such as seismology, structural engineering, and computer science. The work [49] highlights the importance of collaboration between domain experts and ML researchers in developing models that can accurately capture the complexities of physical systems. In earthquake engineering, this collaboration is crucial for developing models that can handle the uncertainties and variabilities inherent in seismic data.

The integration of ML with physics-based models also faces challenges related to computational efficiency and scalability. While ML models can be trained on large datasets, the computational demands of training and deploying these models can be significant. The paper [47] discusses the need for efficient algorithms that can handle the computational complexities of hybrid models. In earthquake engineering, where real-time monitoring and prediction are often required, computational efficiency is a critical factor that must be addressed.

Another challenge is the need for robust data and reliable physical constraints. The performance of hybrid models is heavily dependent on the quality and quantity of data available. The paper [47] emphasizes the importance of incorporating physical constraints into the training process to improve the reliability of predictions. In earthquake engineering, where data can be sparse and noisy, this is particularly important for ensuring the accuracy and robustness of predictions.

The integration of ML with physics-based models also raises questions about the interpretability and explainability of predictions. The paper [47] discusses the need for models that can provide insights into the underlying physical processes. In earthquake engineering, this is essential for understanding the factors that contribute to seismic events and for developing effective mitigation strategies.

Furthermore, the integration of ML with physics-based models requires careful consideration of the validation and testing of hybrid approaches. The paper [47] highlights the need for rigorous validation frameworks that can account for the unique characteristics of hybrid models. In earthquake engineering, where the accuracy of predictions is critical, this is a key area of focus.

In addition to these challenges, the integration of ML with physics-based models also requires addressing issues related to model generalization and adaptability. The paper [47] discusses the need for models that can generalize well to unseen data and adapt to changing conditions. In earthquake engineering, where seismic events can vary significantly, this is essential for ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of predictions.

Overall, the integration of ML with physics-based models presents both significant challenges and opportunities in earthquake engineering. By addressing the issues of consistency, interpretability, and validation, and by fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, researchers can develop more accurate, reliable, and interpretable models that can enhance our understanding of seismic phenomena and improve our ability to mitigate their impacts. The insights from the provided papers underscore the importance of these efforts and highlight the need for continued research and innovation in this field.

### 9.10 Data Bias and Fairness

9.10 Data Bias and Fairness

Data bias and fairness in machine learning (ML) models represent significant challenges when applying these models to earthquake engineering tasks, particularly in risk assessment and disaster management. Biased data can lead to unfair or unreliable predictions, affecting the accuracy of earthquake risk assessments and the effectiveness of disaster response strategies. As machine learning models are increasingly used to make critical decisions in earthquake engineering, addressing data bias and ensuring fairness is essential to maintain public trust and promote equitable outcomes.

One of the primary sources of data bias in earthquake engineering is the uneven distribution of seismic data across different regions. Historical seismic data is often more abundant in areas with dense monitoring networks, such as the United States and Japan, while data in less developed regions or remote areas may be scarce or of lower quality [90]. This imbalance can result in ML models that perform well in data-rich regions but fail to generalize to data-scarce regions, leading to unfair predictions and potentially overlooking vulnerable communities.

Furthermore, the quality of seismic data can vary significantly based on the technology and methodologies used for data collection. For example, older seismic stations may lack the resolution or accuracy of modern instruments, leading to data inconsistencies. Such variations can introduce bias into ML models, as they may rely on data that reflects outdated or incomplete information [3]. In addition, the presence of noise or missing data in seismic records can further complicate the training of ML models, leading to unreliable predictions and decisions.

Data bias can also arise from the way seismic events are labeled and categorized. In some cases, the classification of earthquakes may be influenced by subjective criteria or regional biases, leading to an incomplete or skewed representation of seismic activity. For instance, some studies have shown that the labeling of earthquakes as "mainshocks" or "aftershocks" may vary based on the region and the criteria used, which can introduce bias into ML models trained on such datasets [14]. This inconsistency in data labeling can affect the model's ability to accurately detect and predict seismic events, especially in regions with different geological characteristics.

Another aspect of data bias in earthquake engineering is the potential for algorithmic discrimination. ML models trained on biased datasets may inadvertently learn and reinforce existing biases, leading to unfair predictions and decisions. For example, if an ML model is trained primarily on data from regions with high seismic activity, it may be less effective in predicting earthquakes in regions with lower seismic activity, potentially leading to underestimations of risk in those areas [10]. This can have serious consequences for disaster preparedness and response, as regions with lower seismic activity may be overlooked in risk assessments, leading to inadequate preparedness and response measures.

Fairness-aware techniques and bias detection methods are essential to address these challenges and ensure that ML models in earthquake engineering are both accurate and equitable. One approach to mitigating data bias is to use fairness-aware ML algorithms that explicitly account for bias during the training process. For example, fairness-aware techniques such as adversarial debiasing or reweighting can help reduce the impact of biased data on model predictions [121]. These methods can help ensure that ML models are more robust to data imbalances and produce fairer predictions across different regions and populations.

Another important strategy for addressing data bias is to use diverse and representative datasets. By incorporating data from a wide range of sources and regions, ML models can be trained on more balanced and comprehensive datasets, reducing the risk of biased predictions. For example, the QuakeSet dataset, which includes Sentinel-1 satellite imagery and seismic data, provides a valuable resource for training ML models on diverse seismic data [90]. Similarly, the NADBenchmarks platform aims to compile and provide access to a wide range of benchmark datasets for natural disaster ML tasks, promoting the use of diverse and representative data [194].

In addition to using diverse datasets, fairness-aware evaluation metrics can help identify and address biases in ML models. Traditional evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1-score may not adequately capture the performance of ML models in different regions or populations. Instead, fairness-aware metrics such as demographic parity, equalized odds, or statistical parity can be used to assess the performance of ML models across different groups [121]. These metrics can help ensure that ML models are not only accurate but also fair, reducing the risk of biased predictions and decisions.

Moreover, transparency and interpretability are crucial for ensuring fairness in ML models. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques can help researchers and practitioners understand how ML models make predictions, identifying potential sources of bias and ensuring that decisions are based on fair and reliable information [17]. By making ML models more transparent, stakeholders can better assess the reliability of predictions and make informed decisions.

Finally, ongoing monitoring and auditing of ML models are essential to detect and address biases that may emerge over time. As new data becomes available and seismic conditions change, ML models may need to be re-evaluated and updated to ensure continued fairness and accuracy. Regular audits and performance evaluations can help identify potential biases and ensure that ML models remain effective and equitable in different contexts [121].

In conclusion, data bias and fairness are critical concerns in the application of ML models to earthquake engineering. Addressing these issues requires a combination of fairness-aware techniques, diverse datasets, and transparent evaluation methods. By ensuring that ML models are both accurate and equitable, researchers and practitioners can help improve the reliability of earthquake risk assessments and disaster management strategies, ultimately leading to more effective and equitable outcomes for all communities.

### 9.11 Robustness and Reliability in Real-World Applications

The application of machine learning in earthquake engineering has gained significant attention due to its ability to process and analyze large volumes of complex data, such as seismic records, structural responses, and geological information [218]. These models can provide accurate predictions and insights, which are essential for seismic hazard assessment, structural health monitoring, and damage prediction [219].

One of the key challenges in applying machine learning to earthquake engineering is the generalization capability of models. Traditional machine learning models often struggle with extrapolation, while deep learning models demonstrate better generalization due to their ability to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data [219]. However, this generalization ability is not always guaranteed and requires careful validation and testing [58].

Data scarcity and noise are also major issues in earthquake engineering applications. To address these challenges, data augmentation techniques and synthetic data generation have been explored to improve the quality and diversity of training data [57]. Synthetic data can be particularly useful when real-world data is limited or difficult to obtain [220].

Interpretability of machine learning models is another critical aspect, especially in safety-critical applications like earthquake engineering. Black-box models, such as deep neural networks, often lack transparency, making it difficult to trust their predictions. Various techniques have been proposed to enhance model interpretability, such as the SMILE framework, which provides local explanations for model decisions [221].

The deployment of machine learning models in real-world scenarios also requires considering the broader ecosystem in which they operate. Studies have shown that the performance of models can be affected by systemic failures, where certain groups or scenarios are consistently misclassified [63]. This highlights the importance of evaluating models in a comprehensive and context-aware manner.

In addition, the use of machine learning in earthquake engineering requires addressing the limitations of data and modeling approaches. For instance, data scarcity and the need for physically interpretable models have led to the development of hybrid approaches that combine data-driven methods with domain-specific knowledge [61]. These approaches aim to improve the generalization and reliability of models in real-world applications.

Overall, the integration of machine learning into earthquake engineering offers great potential, but it also presents several challenges that need to be addressed to ensure the reliability, transparency, and effectiveness of the models. Continued research and development in this area are essential for advancing the field and improving earthquake resilience.

### 9.12 Long-Term Model Maintenance and Monitoring

Long-term model maintenance and monitoring are critical components in the application of machine learning (ML) to earthquake engineering. Given the dynamic and evolving nature of seismic data and the complex physical systems involved, it is essential to ensure that ML models remain accurate, reliable, and effective over time. This subsection explores the importance of ongoing model maintenance and monitoring, focusing on challenges such as model drift, obsolescence, and the need for continuous evaluation and updating.  

One of the key challenges in long-term model maintenance is **model drift**, which refers to the gradual degradation of a model's performance over time due to changes in the underlying data distribution. In earthquake engineering, seismic data can vary significantly over time due to natural variations in seismic activity, changes in environmental conditions, and the introduction of new sensor technologies. As a result, ML models trained on historical data may become less effective as they encounter new patterns or anomalies that were not present in the training data. For instance, a model trained to detect seismic events may fail to identify new types of seismic signals or anomalies that emerge due to changes in geological conditions [65]. Therefore, continuous monitoring and retraining are necessary to adapt models to these evolving conditions.  

Another challenge is **model obsolescence**, which occurs when a model becomes outdated due to advancements in technology or changes in the problem domain. In earthquake engineering, this could involve the replacement of outdated sensor networks with more advanced systems, or the development of new methodologies for seismic risk assessment. As new data sources and techniques become available, older models may no longer be able to leverage the full potential of the available data. This highlights the need for **model updating and retraining** to ensure that ML systems remain aligned with the latest scientific and technological developments. For example, in the context of structural health monitoring, models that were initially trained on a specific set of sensors may require retraining when new sensors are deployed or when the characteristics of the monitored structures change over time [65].  

The importance of continuous evaluation and updating is further underscored by the **need for robustness and reliability** in earthquake engineering applications. ML models used for seismic risk assessment, early warning systems, and structural health monitoring must be able to perform consistently under a wide range of conditions. However, as the environment and data evolve, models may become less reliable if they are not regularly assessed and updated. This is particularly important in applications where the consequences of model failure could be severe, such as in the prediction of earthquake impacts or the monitoring of critical infrastructure. For example, a model that fails to accurately predict the seismic response of a building could lead to inadequate safety measures or unnecessary costs. To address this, ongoing evaluation and validation are necessary to ensure that models remain effective and trustworthy [65].  

In addition to model drift and obsolescence, **data quality and availability** pose significant challenges in long-term model maintenance. Seismic data is often sparse, noisy, or incomplete, which can make it difficult to train and validate ML models effectively. Furthermore, the quality of data can vary depending on the sensor technology used, the location of the sensors, and the environmental conditions in which they operate. This variability can introduce uncertainties into the model's predictions and reduce its overall reliability. To mitigate these issues, **data preprocessing, cleaning, and augmentation techniques** are often required to ensure that the data used for training and testing is as accurate and representative as possible. For example, techniques such as data interpolation, noise reduction, and synthetic data generation can be used to improve the quality and completeness of seismic datasets [65].  

Moreover, the **integration of domain knowledge and physical principles** into ML models is essential for ensuring their long-term effectiveness. In earthquake engineering, physical laws and domain-specific knowledge play a crucial role in shaping the behavior of seismic systems. By incorporating these principles into ML models, it is possible to improve their interpretability, generalizability, and reliability. For instance, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been shown to be effective in modeling complex physical systems by embedding governing equations into the training process [65]. This approach not only enhances the model's accuracy but also ensures that it remains consistent with the underlying physical laws, which is critical for long-term performance.  

Finally, the **development of automated monitoring and maintenance systems** is an important area of research in earthquake engineering. As ML models become more complex and widely deployed, it is increasingly difficult to manually monitor and update them on a regular basis. To address this challenge, researchers are exploring the use of **automated monitoring tools and self-supervised learning techniques** that can detect changes in model performance and trigger updates when necessary. For example, self-supervised learning can be used to identify anomalies in the data or model outputs, allowing for timely interventions to maintain the model's accuracy and reliability [65]. Additionally, **model versioning and deployment strategies** can help ensure that models are consistently updated and deployed in a controlled manner, reducing the risk of errors and improving overall system performance.

### 9.13 Ethical and Societal Implications

The application of machine learning (ML) in earthquake engineering brings with it a host of ethical and societal implications that must be carefully addressed. As ML models become more integrated into seismic monitoring, risk assessment, and disaster management, the need for responsible AI practices becomes increasingly urgent. Transparency, accountability, and the potential for unintended consequences are central concerns that require attention. The integration of ML into critical infrastructure and decision-making processes demands not only technical rigor but also ethical scrutiny to ensure that these systems do not inadvertently cause harm or exacerbate existing inequalities.

Transparency is a cornerstone of ethical AI. In earthquake engineering, the use of complex ML models, such as deep neural networks, often raises concerns about "black-box" systems that are difficult to interpret. For instance, in the context of structural health monitoring, models like those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are used to detect and classify damage [51]. However, these models can obscure the reasoning behind their predictions, making it challenging for engineers and policymakers to trust their outputs. The lack of transparency can lead to a loss of accountability, as it becomes unclear who is responsible for decisions made based on ML-driven insights. This is particularly critical in high-stakes scenarios such as real-time earthquake early warning systems, where a delay or misclassification can have catastrophic consequences [15]. 

Accountability is another essential ethical dimension. When ML models are used to inform critical decisions, such as resource allocation during disaster response, the question of who is accountable for errors or failures becomes paramount. For example, in post-disaster scenarios, ML models are increasingly used to assess damage from satellite imagery [91]. However, if such models fail to detect certain types of damage or misclassify areas, the consequences could be dire. The responsibility for such failures must be clearly defined, and mechanisms for redress must be in place. This calls for the development of robust governance frameworks that ensure accountability at every stage of the ML lifecycle, from data collection to deployment [17]. 

Moreover, the potential for unintended consequences cannot be overlooked. ML models are only as good as the data they are trained on, and the presence of biases in training data can lead to skewed predictions. For example, in the context of earthquake risk assessment, biased data may result in certain communities being overlooked, leading to unequal disaster preparedness and response [106]. This raises serious ethical concerns about fairness and equity. In the case of structural health monitoring, if a model is trained primarily on data from well-maintained infrastructure, it may not perform as well in areas with older or less maintained structures, potentially leaving vulnerable populations at greater risk [94]. 

The ethical implications of ML in earthquake engineering extend beyond the technical domain to broader societal concerns. The deployment of ML-driven systems in disaster management can have profound effects on public trust and community engagement. For instance, the use of social media analysis to detect and respond to earthquake-related information [98] can be a double-edged sword. While it can provide valuable insights into public sentiment and community needs, it also raises concerns about data privacy and the potential misuse of personal information. The ethical use of such data requires strict adherence to privacy regulations and the implementation of robust data governance practices.

Furthermore, the integration of ML into earthquake engineering must consider the long-term societal impact. For example, the reliance on ML models for seismic monitoring and prediction could lead to a reduction in the need for human expertise in seismology, potentially leading to a loss of knowledge and skills in the field [3]. This could have unintended consequences, such as a decrease in the ability of human experts to interpret and respond to seismic events in ways that are contextually appropriate. Additionally, the potential for job displacement in certain areas of seismology and structural engineering must be carefully managed to avoid social unrest and economic disparities.

Responsible AI practices are essential to address these ethical and societal implications. This includes the development of interpretable and explainable ML models that can provide clear insights into their decision-making processes. Techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) [17] can help make complex models more transparent, enabling engineers and policymakers to understand and trust their outputs. Additionally, the use of fairness-aware algorithms and bias detection methods is crucial to ensure that ML models do not perpetuate or exacerbate existing inequalities [106].

In conclusion, the ethical and societal implications of using machine learning in earthquake engineering are multifaceted and require careful consideration. Transparency, accountability, and the potential for unintended consequences must be addressed through responsible AI practices. By prioritizing these ethical considerations, the field of earthquake engineering can ensure that the integration of ML not only enhances technological capabilities but also upholds the values of fairness, equity, and public trust. This will be essential in building resilient and sustainable communities in the face of seismic risks.

## 10 Emerging Trends and Future Directions

### 10.1 Physics-Informed Learning

Physics-informed learning is an emerging trend in machine learning that integrates physical laws and domain knowledge into models to improve their accuracy, generalizability, and interpretability, particularly in complex domains like earthquake engineering. This approach addresses the limitations of purely data-driven models, which often lack the ability to incorporate fundamental physical principles, leading to models that may not generalize well to new scenarios or provide interpretable insights. By embedding domain-specific knowledge into the learning process, physics-informed models can achieve better performance and reliability, especially when dealing with scarce or noisy data.

One of the key advantages of physics-informed learning is its ability to enhance model interpretability. In earthquake engineering, where decisions can have significant consequences, it is crucial to understand how models arrive at their predictions. For example, in the paper titled "Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Seismic Response Prediction of Nonlinear Steel Moment Resisting Frame Structures," the authors emphasize the importance of incorporating physical laws, such as Newton's second law, into deep neural networks to ensure that predictions are not only accurate but also physically meaningful [7]. This approach helps in identifying which features of the input data are most influential in determining the output, thereby improving the transparency of the model.

Another significant benefit of physics-informed learning is its potential to improve the generalizability of machine learning models. Traditional data-driven models often struggle to perform well on data that differs from the training set, particularly when dealing with complex and dynamic systems like those encountered in earthquake engineering. By integrating physical constraints and domain knowledge, physics-informed models can better capture the underlying mechanisms of the system, leading to more robust predictions. This is particularly relevant in earthquake engineering, where the behavior of structures under seismic loads can be highly nonlinear and influenced by a variety of factors, including material properties, boundary conditions, and environmental factors.

The integration of physical laws into machine learning models also enhances their ability to handle sparse and noisy data, which is a common challenge in earthquake engineering. In many cases, seismic data is limited in quantity and quality, making it difficult to train accurate and reliable models. However, by incorporating domain knowledge, physics-informed models can mitigate the effects of data scarcity and noise. For example, in the paper titled "Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Seismic Response Evaluation of Nonlinear Systems," the authors propose a physics-informed recurrent neural network (RNN) that leverages the equation of motion to learn system nonlinearities and constrain the solution space within physically interpretable results [92]. This approach not only improves the accuracy of predictions but also ensures that the models remain consistent with the underlying physical principles.

Moreover, physics-informed learning can help address the issue of model robustness in the face of uncertainty. Earthquake engineering involves a high degree of uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of seismic events and the variability of material properties and structural behaviors. By incorporating physical constraints, physics-informed models can better handle these uncertainties and provide more reliable predictions. For instance, in the paper titled "Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Seismic Response Prediction of Nonlinear Steel Moment Resisting Frame Structures," the authors highlight the importance of model order reduction and the use of LSTM networks to capture temporal dependencies, which together enhance the model's ability to handle complex and uncertain data [7].

The application of physics-informed learning in earthquake engineering also extends to the development of hybrid models that combine the strengths of machine learning with traditional physics-based simulations. These hybrid models can leverage the computational efficiency of machine learning while ensuring the accuracy and reliability of predictions through the incorporation of physical laws. For example, in the paper titled "Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Seismic Response Evaluation of Nonlinear Systems," the authors propose a framework that integrates physics-informed neural networks with traditional finite element analysis to improve the accuracy of seismic response predictions [92]. This approach not only enhances the predictive capabilities of the models but also provides a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying physical processes.

In addition to improving accuracy and generalizability, physics-informed learning can also aid in the development of more efficient and scalable models. Traditional physics-based models often require significant computational resources and time to solve complex problems, making them less suitable for real-time applications. By incorporating domain knowledge into the learning process, physics-informed models can achieve similar levels of accuracy with reduced computational costs. This is particularly important in earthquake engineering, where real-time monitoring and early warning systems require fast and efficient models. For example, in the paper titled "Generalized Neural Networks for Real-Time Earthquake Early Warning," the authors propose a data recombination method to create generalized earthquakes for neural network training, enabling real-time earthquake early warning systems that can operate across different regions and monitoring setups [22].

Finally, physics-informed learning has the potential to enhance the interpretability of machine learning models, which is crucial for gaining trust and acceptance in critical applications. In earthquake engineering, where decisions can have significant consequences, it is essential to understand the rationale behind model predictions. By incorporating physical laws and domain knowledge, physics-informed models can provide more transparent and interpretable insights, making it easier for engineers and decision-makers to validate and trust the models. For instance, in the paper titled "Glass-box model representation of seismic failure mode prediction for conventional RC shear walls," the authors propose a glass-box classification model that provides interpretable predictions of seismic failure modes, which can be used to guide engineering decisions [4].

In conclusion, physics-informed learning is a promising approach that integrates physical laws and domain knowledge into machine learning models to enhance their accuracy, generalizability, and interpretability in earthquake engineering applications. By addressing the limitations of purely data-driven models, physics-informed learning can lead to more reliable and robust predictions, ultimately contributing to safer and more resilient infrastructure. As the field of earthquake engineering continues to evolve, the integration of physics-informed learning will play a critical role in advancing the capabilities of machine learning models and improving the overall performance of seismic risk assessment and mitigation strategies.

### 10.2 Transfer Learning

# Machine Learning in Earthquake Engineering: A Comprehensive Survey

## 10 Emerging Trends and Future Directions

### 10.2 Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is a powerful technique in machine learning that enables models to leverage knowledge gained from one task or domain to improve performance on another related task or domain. In the context of earthquake engineering, where labeled data is often scarce, transfer learning has the potential to significantly enhance model performance by utilizing pre-trained models or knowledge from related domains. This approach is particularly relevant in earthquake engineering, where the complexity of seismic data and the high computational cost of training deep learning models from scratch pose significant challenges.

One of the key advantages of transfer learning is its ability to reduce the amount of labeled data required for training. In earthquake engineering, collecting and labeling seismic data can be a time-consuming and expensive process. By leveraging pre-trained models on large datasets, researchers can significantly reduce the need for extensive labeled data while still achieving high accuracy. For example, in the paper "Physics-Guided Convolutional Neural Network (PhyCNN) for Data-driven Seismic Response Modeling," the authors demonstrated that incorporating physics-based constraints into a deep learning model can improve its performance without the need for large amounts of labeled data [79].

Another important aspect of transfer learning in earthquake engineering is the ability to generalize knowledge from one seismic region to another. Earthquake data can vary significantly across different regions due to differences in geological conditions, fault structures, and seismic activity. Transfer learning allows models to adapt to these variations by leveraging knowledge from other regions. For instance, in the paper "Data-Driven Prediction of Seismic Intensity Distributions Featuring Hybrid Classification-Regression Models," the authors used a data-driven approach to predict seismic intensity distributions without relying on geographical information, demonstrating the potential of transfer learning in handling diverse seismic data [8].

Transfer learning can also be used to improve the performance of models in scenarios where the target domain has limited data. In earthquake engineering, this is particularly useful for predicting the seismic response of structures in regions with limited historical data. By pre-training models on data from regions with abundant historical seismic data, researchers can then fine-tune these models on the limited data available in the target region. This approach has been successfully applied in the paper "Machine Learning-Based Assessment of Energy Behavior of RC Shear Walls," where the authors used a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model to predict the energy dissipation capacity of shear walls based on wall design parameters [12].

In addition to improving model performance, transfer learning can also help in addressing the challenges of model generalization and out-of-distribution performance. Seismic data can be highly variable, and models trained on data from one region may not perform well on data from another region. Transfer learning helps in bridging this gap by enabling models to adapt to new environments and data distributions. For example, in the paper "Machine Learning for Seismic Risk and Impact Assessment," the authors highlighted the importance of transfer learning in improving the generalization of models for seismic risk assessment [106].

Another application of transfer learning in earthquake engineering is in the domain of structural health monitoring. In this context, transfer learning can be used to adapt models trained on data from one type of structure to another type of structure. This is particularly useful for monitoring the health of bridges, buildings, and other critical infrastructure. For instance, in the paper "Machine Learning in Structural Health Monitoring and Damage Detection," the authors explored the use of transfer learning to improve the performance of models for damage detection in structures with limited training data [51].

Transfer learning can also be used to enhance the performance of models in real-time applications. In earthquake engineering, real-time monitoring and early warning systems require models that can quickly adapt to new data. Transfer learning allows models to be updated with new data without retraining from scratch, making them more efficient and effective in real-time scenarios. For example, in the paper "Controlling earthquake-like instabilities using artificial intelligence," the authors used reinforcement learning techniques to control earthquake-like instabilities, demonstrating the potential of transfer learning in real-time applications [25].

Moreover, transfer learning can be used to address the challenges of data bias and fairness in earthquake engineering. Seismic data can be biased due to differences in data collection methods and geographical coverage. Transfer learning helps in mitigating these biases by leveraging knowledge from diverse datasets. In the paper "Shapley values and machine learning to characterize metamaterials for seismic applications," the authors used machine learning models to predict the properties of metamaterials, demonstrating the potential of transfer learning in addressing data bias [2].

In conclusion, transfer learning offers a promising approach to address the challenges of data scarcity, model generalization, and real-time applications in earthquake engineering. By leveraging knowledge from related domains and tasks, transfer learning can significantly enhance the performance of machine learning models in earthquake engineering. As the field continues to evolve, further research into transfer learning techniques and their applications in earthquake engineering will be essential to address the complex challenges faced in this domain. The integration of transfer learning with other emerging trends such as physics-informed learning and explainable AI will be crucial in advancing the capabilities of machine learning in earthquake engineering.

### 10.3 Real-Time Data Processing

## Machine Learning in Earthquake Engineering: A Comprehensive Survey

### 10.3 Real-Time Data Processing

Real-time data processing plays a pivotal role in earthquake engineering, particularly in the context of early warning systems, rapid decision-making, and dynamic environment adaptation. The integration of machine learning (ML) into real-time data processing has revolutionized the way seismic events are analyzed and responded to, enabling more accurate and timely predictions. This subsection explores the significance of real-time data processing in earthquake engineering, highlighting the role of ML in accelerating analysis, enhancing early warning systems, and facilitating decision-making in real-world scenarios.

In earthquake engineering, real-time data processing is essential for detecting seismic events as they occur and initiating timely responses to mitigate potential damage. Traditional methods often rely on post-event analysis, which can be too slow to provide actionable insights during the critical moments following an earthquake. Machine learning, with its ability to process and analyze large volumes of data quickly, has emerged as a game-changer in this domain. For example, the SeisT model [15] was designed for a variety of earthquake monitoring tasks, including real-time detection and parameter estimation. The model demonstrated impressive out-of-distribution generalization performance, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art models in tasks like earthquake detection, seismic phase picking, and magnitude estimation. Such models are crucial for real-time applications, as they enable rapid analysis of seismic data, allowing for immediate response actions.

The use of machine learning in real-time data processing is particularly evident in the development of earthquake early warning systems. These systems rely on the timely detection of seismic waves to provide alerts before the damaging effects of an earthquake are felt. For instance, the work described in "Real-time Earthquake Early Warning with Deep Learning [5]" introduced a novel deep learning earthquake early warning system that utilizes fully convolutional networks to simultaneously detect earthquakes and estimate their source parameters from continuous seismic waveform streams. The system determines earthquake location and magnitude as soon as one station receives earthquake signals and evolves the solutions by receiving continuous data. This approach is critical for real-time applications, as it ensures that alerts are issued as soon as possible, providing valuable time for emergency response.

In addition to early warning systems, real-time data processing with ML is also vital for decision-making in dynamic environments. Earthquake engineering involves not only the prediction of seismic events but also the assessment of their potential impact on structures and communities. Machine learning models can process real-time data from various sources, such as seismic sensors, satellite imagery, and social media, to provide comprehensive insights. For example, the study on "Near-real-time Earthquake-induced Fatality Estimation using Crowdsourced Data and Large-Language Models [53]" introduced an end-to-end framework that leverages multi-lingual, crowdsourced social media data to estimate casualties in real-time. This approach not only enhances the speed of fatality estimation but also improves the accuracy of the predictions, which is crucial for effective disaster response.

The application of real-time data processing in earthquake engineering is also evident in the context of structural health monitoring. Machine learning models can analyze real-time data from sensors to detect anomalies and predict potential failures. For instance, the study on "Deep learning for structural health monitoring: An application to heritage structures [51]" employed deep learning techniques to inspect and detect anomalies in the large dataset recorded during a long-term monitoring campaign on the San Frediano bell tower in Lucca. The framework was designed as an unsupervised anomaly detection task, training a Temporal Fusion Transformer to learn the normal dynamics of the structure and detect anomalies by comparing predicted and observed frequencies. This real-time monitoring capability is essential for ensuring the safety and integrity of critical infrastructure.

Moreover, real-time data processing with ML is being used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of seismic imaging and inversion. The use of deep learning techniques in seismic imaging has shown promising results, enabling the reconstruction of subsurface structures from seismic data. For example, the work on "Fourier Neural Operator Surrogate Model to Predict 3D Seismic Waves Propagation [169]" introduced a novel approach using the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to predict ground motion time series from a 3D geological description. The model was trained on a high-fidelity simulation database and demonstrated the ability to produce accurate ground motion even when the underlying geology exhibits large heterogeneities. This real-time prediction capability is essential for assessing the potential impact of earthquakes on different regions.

In conclusion, real-time data processing with machine learning is a critical component of earthquake engineering, enabling rapid analysis, early warning systems, and dynamic decision-making. The integration of ML into real-time data processing has transformed the way seismic events are monitored and responded to, providing timely and accurate insights that are crucial for disaster management and public safety. As the field continues to evolve, the development of more advanced ML models and techniques will further enhance the capabilities of real-time data processing in earthquake engineering, ensuring that communities are better prepared for seismic events.

### 10.4 Multi-Fidelity Learning

Multi-fidelity learning has emerged as a promising approach to address the challenges of data scarcity, model generalization, and computational efficiency in earthquake engineering. This approach leverages data from multiple sources and levels of accuracy, combining low-fidelity and high-fidelity data to build more efficient and effective models for complex earthquake-related phenomena. By integrating data from different fidelity levels, multi-fidelity learning enables the development of models that can capture both the macroscopic and microscopic aspects of seismic events, enhancing their predictive power and reliability.

One of the key benefits of multi-fidelity learning in earthquake engineering is its ability to handle the limitations of high-fidelity data, which is often expensive to obtain and scarce. High-fidelity data, such as detailed seismic waveforms or precise ground motion measurements, are typically generated through advanced simulations or high-resolution field experiments. However, these data are not always available or accessible, especially in regions with limited monitoring infrastructure. In contrast, low-fidelity data, such as historical earthquake records or simplified models, are more readily available but may lack the precision and detail needed for accurate predictions. By combining these two types of data, multi-fidelity learning can effectively balance the trade-off between data quality and availability.

The application of multi-fidelity learning in earthquake engineering is illustrated by the study on the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) [10]. This research demonstrates how PINNs can be trained using data from multiple sources, including empirical observations and physical models, to improve the accuracy of earthquake predictions. By incorporating physical constraints into the learning process, PINNs can leverage both high-fidelity and low-fidelity data to produce more reliable and interpretable results. This approach not only enhances the predictive capability of the model but also ensures that the model adheres to the underlying physical laws governing seismic events.

Another example of multi-fidelity learning in earthquake engineering is the work on seismic data reconstruction using a diffusion model [99]. This study explores how multi-fidelity learning can be used to reconstruct missing seismic data by combining high-fidelity and low-fidelity data. By introducing conditional supervision constraints into the diffusion model, the researchers were able to generate high-quality reconstructions of 3D seismic data, even when the input data was incomplete or noisy. This approach demonstrates the potential of multi-fidelity learning to improve the quality and consistency of seismic data, which is crucial for accurate analysis and prediction.

In addition to data reconstruction, multi-fidelity learning can also be applied to improve the efficiency of seismic inversion, a critical process in earthquake engineering. Seismic inversion involves the estimation of subsurface properties from seismic data, and it is often computationally intensive due to the large volume of data and the complexity of the models. The study on the use of multi-fidelity learning in seismic inversion [80] highlights how this approach can be used to accelerate the inversion process. By combining data from different sources and levels of accuracy, the researchers were able to achieve faster convergence rates and more accurate results, demonstrating the potential of multi-fidelity learning to enhance the efficiency of seismic inversion.

Moreover, multi-fidelity learning can be applied to improve the accuracy of earthquake early warning systems. These systems rely on real-time data from seismic networks to detect and predict earthquakes, and the quality of the data is crucial for their performance. The study on the use of deep learning for earthquake early warning [5] demonstrates how multi-fidelity learning can be used to improve the accuracy of these systems. By combining data from different sources, including seismic stations, satellite observations, and ground sensors, the researchers were able to develop a more robust and reliable early warning system. This approach not only improves the accuracy of the predictions but also enhances the system's ability to handle noisy or incomplete data.

The integration of multi-fidelity learning with physics-based models is another promising application in earthquake engineering. Physics-based models, such as finite element models and numerical simulations, provide a detailed understanding of the physical processes involved in earthquakes. However, these models are often computationally expensive and require significant resources. By combining them with multi-fidelity learning, researchers can develop more efficient and accurate models that can be used for real-time analysis and prediction. The study on the use of physics-informed neural networks [10] illustrates how this approach can be used to improve the accuracy of physics-based models by incorporating data from multiple sources and levels of accuracy. This integration not only enhances the predictive capability of the models but also ensures that they adhere to the underlying physical laws.

In addition to these applications, multi-fidelity learning can also be used to address the challenges of data scarcity and model generalization in earthquake engineering. Data scarcity is a common issue in earthquake engineering, as high-quality data is often limited and expensive to obtain. By combining data from multiple sources and levels of accuracy, multi-fidelity learning can help overcome this challenge by providing a more comprehensive and diverse dataset for training and validation. The study on the use of multi-fidelity learning in seismic data reconstruction [99] demonstrates how this approach can be used to improve the quality and consistency of seismic data, even when the input data is incomplete or noisy.

Furthermore, multi-fidelity learning can be used to improve the generalization of machine learning models in earthquake engineering. Generalization refers to the ability of a model to perform well on new and unseen data, which is crucial for real-world applications. By incorporating data from multiple sources and levels of accuracy, multi-fidelity learning can help improve the generalization of machine learning models by providing a more diverse and representative dataset. The study on the use of multi-fidelity learning in seismic inversion [80] demonstrates how this approach can be used to improve the generalization of seismic inversion models, making them more robust and reliable for real-world applications.

Overall, multi-fidelity learning offers a powerful and flexible approach to address the challenges of data scarcity, model generalization, and computational efficiency in earthquake engineering. By leveraging data from multiple sources and levels of accuracy, this approach enables the development of more efficient and effective models for complex earthquake-related phenomena. As the field of earthquake engineering continues to evolve, the integration of multi-fidelity learning with other advanced techniques, such as physics-informed models and deep learning, will play a crucial role in improving the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of earthquake prediction, monitoring, and risk assessment. The potential of multi-fidelity learning in earthquake engineering is vast, and further research is needed to explore its full capabilities and applications.

### 10.6 Spatio-Temporal Learning

---
Spatio-temporal learning represents a critical frontier in the application of machine learning (ML) to earthquake engineering, offering a powerful framework for modeling seismic events and their impacts over both space and time. Unlike traditional methods that often treat spatial and temporal dimensions independently, spatio-temporal learning integrates these dimensions to capture the complex dynamics of seismic processes. This approach is particularly relevant for earthquake engineering, where the spatial distribution of seismic activity and the temporal evolution of seismic events are crucial for accurate prediction, monitoring, and risk assessment. By leveraging spatio-temporal learning, researchers can develop more comprehensive models that account for the interplay between geographical and temporal factors, leading to more reliable and actionable insights.

One of the primary challenges in spatio-temporal learning for earthquake engineering is the inherent complexity of seismic data. Seismic events are characterized by their high-dimensional, non-stationary, and often noisy nature, making it difficult to extract meaningful patterns and relationships. To address these challenges, researchers have turned to advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning, which can automatically learn hierarchical representations from raw data. For instance, the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has shown promise in capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies in seismic data [16]. These models can effectively learn from large-scale seismic datasets, enabling the identification of subtle patterns that may be indicative of impending seismic activity.

Another key advantage of spatio-temporal learning is its ability to model the propagation of seismic waves and their effects on different regions. By incorporating spatial information, such as the distribution of seismic stations and the geological characteristics of the Earth's crust, spatio-temporal models can provide a more accurate representation of how seismic waves travel and interact with the subsurface. This is particularly important for applications such as seismic hazard assessment and early warning systems, where the spatial and temporal distribution of seismic activity can significantly impact the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. For example, the use of spatio-temporal learning in the detection of seismic phase arrivals has been shown to improve the accuracy of earthquake location and magnitude estimation [23].

Moreover, spatio-temporal learning can enhance the interpretability of machine learning models in earthquake engineering. By explicitly modeling the spatial and temporal dimensions of seismic data, researchers can gain deeper insights into the underlying physical processes that drive seismic events. This is particularly valuable in the context of structural health monitoring, where the ability to detect and localize damage in buildings and infrastructure is critical for ensuring safety and resilience. For instance, the integration of spatio-temporal learning with physics-informed models has been explored to improve the accuracy and reliability of damage detection algorithms [7]. These models can leverage both the spatial distribution of sensors and the temporal evolution of structural responses to provide more precise and robust damage assessments.

In addition to improving the accuracy of seismic models, spatio-temporal learning also offers opportunities for real-time monitoring and adaptive decision-making. By processing seismic data in real-time, spatio-temporal models can provide timely alerts and updates, which are essential for disaster response and emergency management. The use of edge computing and distributed sensor networks can further enhance the efficiency of spatio-temporal learning by enabling local processing and reducing latency. This is particularly relevant for applications such as earthquake early warning systems, where rapid detection and dissemination of alerts can save lives and minimize damage. For example, the application of spatio-temporal learning in the context of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has demonstrated the potential for real-time monitoring of seismic activity with high spatial and temporal resolution [222].

Despite the promising potential of spatio-temporal learning, several challenges remain. One of the main challenges is the limited availability of high-quality, labeled seismic data, which is essential for training and validating spatio-temporal models. Additionally, the computational complexity of spatio-temporal models can be a barrier to their widespread adoption, particularly in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, researchers are exploring techniques such as transfer learning, data augmentation, and model compression to improve the efficiency and generalizability of spatio-temporal learning models [103; 163].

Furthermore, the integration of spatio-temporal learning with domain-specific knowledge, such as geological and geophysical principles, is crucial for ensuring the reliability and interpretability of machine learning models. This can be achieved through the development of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) approaches, which explicitly incorporate physical laws and constraints into the learning process. Such approaches can help mitigate the risks of overfitting and improve the generalizability of models to new and unseen seismic data [7; 48].

In conclusion, spatio-temporal learning represents a transformative approach to earthquake engineering, offering a powerful framework for modeling seismic events and their impacts over space and time. By integrating spatial and temporal dimensions, spatio-temporal models can provide more accurate and interpretable insights, enabling better prediction, monitoring, and risk assessment. However, the successful application of spatio-temporal learning in earthquake engineering requires addressing several challenges, including data scarcity, computational efficiency, and the integration of domain-specific knowledge. As the field continues to evolve, the development of more advanced and efficient spatio-temporal learning techniques will be essential for advancing our understanding of seismic processes and improving the resilience of critical infrastructure.

### 10.7 Adaptive and Self-Supervised Learning

The advent of machine learning (ML) has significantly transformed various fields, and earthquake engineering is no exception. One of the most promising and rapidly evolving areas in this domain is the use of adaptive and self-supervised learning techniques. These methodologies are designed to enable models to continuously improve and adjust to new data and conditions without the need for extensive retraining. This capability is particularly crucial in earthquake engineering, where the dynamic nature of seismic events and the often limited availability of labeled data make traditional supervised learning approaches less effective.

Adaptive learning refers to the ability of a model to adjust its parameters and behavior based on new data or changing environments. In the context of earthquake engineering, this means that models can dynamically update their predictions and insights as new seismic data becomes available. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, is a technique where models learn from the data itself without the need for explicit human labeling. This is particularly useful in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain, which is often the case in seismic data analysis.

One of the key advantages of adaptive and self-supervised learning is their ability to handle the inherent complexity and variability of seismic data. For instance, the study on "Exploring Challenges in Deep Learning of Single-Station Ground Motion Records" [75] highlights the challenges of training deep learning models on single-station ground motion records. The study found that these models often rely heavily on the highly correlated P and S phase arrival information, which can limit their effectiveness. However, adaptive learning techniques can help mitigate this issue by continuously refining the model's understanding of these complex patterns without requiring extensive retraining.

In addition, self-supervised learning has shown great promise in improving the generalization capabilities of models in earthquake engineering. For example, the paper "Deep Learning for Laboratory Earthquake Prediction and Autoregressive Forecasting of Fault Zone Stress" [20] discusses the use of deep learning (DL) methods for labquake prediction and autoregressive (AR) forecasting. The study found that DL models, when trained on synthetic data, can predict fault zone stress with high fidelity. This suggests that self-supervised learning techniques, which can leverage synthetic data to train models, could be highly effective in real-world seismic data analysis.

Another important aspect of adaptive and self-supervised learning is their potential to enhance the interpretability of machine learning models. The study "Interpretability in Convolutional Neural Networks for Building Damage Classification in Satellite Imagery" [69] emphasizes the importance of interpretability in deep learning models, particularly in critical applications like earthquake risk assessment and structural health monitoring. The study found that using techniques like gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) can provide valuable insights into the decision-making process of models. Adaptive learning techniques can further enhance this interpretability by continuously refining the model's understanding of the data and its underlying patterns.

Furthermore, the integration of adaptive and self-supervised learning with physics-based models can lead to more robust and reliable predictions. The paper "Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction" [10] discusses the development of a multi-network physics-informed neural network (PINN) for both the forward problem and the direct inversion of nonlinear fault friction parameters. The study found that the PINN model could approximate the solution to the governing equations to low errors, demonstrating the potential of combining adaptive learning with physics-based constraints. This approach can be particularly useful in earthquake engineering, where the integration of physical laws and domain knowledge can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions.

The application of adaptive and self-supervised learning in earthquake monitoring systems is also gaining traction. The study "Real-time Earthquake Early Warning with Deep Learning Application to the 2016 Central Apennines, Italy Earthquake Sequence" [5] presents a deep learning earthquake early warning system that utilizes fully convolutional networks to simultaneously detect earthquakes and estimate their source parameters from continuous seismic waveform streams. The system can determine earthquake location and magnitude as soon as one station receives earthquake signals and evolutionarily improves the solutions by receiving continuous data. This real-time capability is enhanced by adaptive learning techniques, which allow the model to continuously update its predictions based on new data.

Moreover, the use of adaptive and self-supervised learning in seismic data augmentation is another promising area. The paper "SeismoGen: Seismic Waveform Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks" [28] discusses the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate synthetic seismic data. The study found that the use of synthetic data significantly improved the detectability of earthquake classification models. This suggests that self-supervised learning techniques, which can leverage synthetic data to train models, can be highly effective in improving the performance of seismic data analysis.

In conclusion, the integration of adaptive and self-supervised learning in earthquake engineering offers a promising avenue for improving the accuracy, generalization, and interpretability of machine learning models. These techniques enable models to continuously adapt to new data and conditions, making them highly suitable for the dynamic and complex nature of seismic data. As the field of earthquake engineering continues to evolve, the development and application of adaptive and self-supervised learning techniques will play a crucial role in advancing the capabilities of machine learning in this domain.

### 10.8 Hybrid AI-Physical Models

[223]
[223]

### 10.9 Explainable AI for Earthquake Engineering

Explainable AI (XAI) is a critical component in the application of machine learning (ML) within earthquake engineering, where the stakes are high and the need for trust and transparency is paramount. Earthquake engineering involves complex, high-risk scenarios where decisions made based on AI-driven models can have significant implications for public safety, infrastructure resilience, and disaster management. Therefore, it is essential that AI models used in these contexts are not only accurate but also interpretable and explainable. This is where explainable AI plays a vital role, offering the potential to bridge the gap between black-box models and human understanding, thus fostering trust and enabling informed decision-making.

In the context of earthquake engineering, the importance of XAI stems from several key factors. First, the field often deals with critical decisions that involve human lives and substantial economic investments. For example, in seismic risk assessment, AI models are used to estimate the likelihood and impact of future earthquakes. These predictions can influence infrastructure design, building codes, and emergency response strategies. Without transparency, it is difficult to validate the models’ outputs or understand the reasoning behind their predictions, which can lead to skepticism and resistance from stakeholders, including engineers, policymakers, and the general public. The need for explainability is especially pronounced in scenarios where the AI model’s decisions could be challenged or require regulatory approval, such as in the design of earthquake-resistant structures.

Second, the complexity of seismic data and the dynamic nature of earthquake events make it challenging to ensure that AI models capture the underlying physical processes accurately. Seismic data is often noisy, incomplete, and subject to high variability, which can result in models that are overly reliant on correlations rather than causal relationships. Explainable AI techniques can help identify the key features and patterns that the model uses to make predictions, thereby providing insights into the model’s decision-making process. This can be particularly valuable in structural health monitoring, where the ability to interpret the model’s outputs can aid in the early detection of damage and the identification of the root causes of structural failures [130].

Moreover, the integration of physics-based knowledge into AI models is a growing trend in earthquake engineering, as it can enhance the models’ accuracy and reliability. However, when combining data-driven approaches with physics-informed models, the need for explainability becomes even more critical. For instance, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) incorporate the governing equations of physical systems into the training process, but their decisions can still be difficult to interpret. Explainable AI techniques can help to dissect these models and ensure that the physical constraints are being respected, which is essential for maintaining the validity and trustworthiness of the predictions [47].

The application of explainable AI in earthquake engineering also addresses the issue of model generalization and out-of-distribution performance. In many cases, AI models trained on historical seismic data may not perform well when applied to new or unseen scenarios. Explainability can help identify the limitations of the model and highlight the conditions under which it is likely to fail. For example, in the context of earthquake prediction, models that are trained on data from a specific region may not generalize well to other regions with different geological characteristics. By providing insights into the model’s behavior, explainable AI can help researchers and practitioners understand the factors that contribute to the model’s performance and develop strategies to improve its robustness.

One of the key challenges in implementing explainable AI in earthquake engineering is the balance between model complexity and interpretability. Deep learning models, while highly effective, are often difficult to interpret due to their layered architecture and non-linear transformations. This is where techniques such as Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) can be invaluable. These methods provide visual and numerical insights into the model’s decision-making process, enabling engineers to understand which features are most influential in the predictions. For example, in structural damage detection, these techniques can help identify the specific regions of a building or bridge that are most likely to be damaged based on the model’s analysis of sensor data [130].

Furthermore, explainable AI can play a crucial role in the development of hybrid models that integrate machine learning with physics-based simulations. These hybrid models combine the strengths of data-driven approaches with the rigor of physical laws, resulting in more accurate and reliable predictions. However, the complexity of these models can make it challenging to understand how they arrive at their conclusions. Explainable AI techniques can help to bridge this gap by providing clear explanations of the model’s behavior, thereby ensuring that the predictions are not only accurate but also understandable and actionable.

In addition to technical considerations, the ethical implications of using AI in earthquake engineering also highlight the need for explainability. AI models can inadvertently perpetuate biases present in the training data, leading to unfair or unreliable predictions. For example, if a model is trained on data from a specific region, it may not perform well for other regions with different characteristics, potentially leading to disparities in risk assessments and disaster response strategies. Explainable AI can help to identify and mitigate these biases, ensuring that the models are fair and equitable in their predictions [130].

The importance of explainable AI is also underscored by the growing use of AI in real-time applications such as earthquake early warning systems. These systems rely on rapid and accurate predictions to provide timely alerts to affected populations. However, the opacity of black-box models can make it difficult to validate their outputs or understand their limitations. Explainable AI can help to ensure that the models used in these systems are transparent and reliable, thereby enhancing public trust and the effectiveness of the early warning systems.

In conclusion, the integration of explainable AI into earthquake engineering is essential for ensuring the transparency, reliability, and trustworthiness of AI-driven solutions. By providing insights into the decision-making processes of AI models, explainable AI can help engineers and policymakers make informed decisions, validate predictions, and ensure that the models are fair and equitable. As the field of earthquake engineering continues to evolve, the development and application of explainable AI will play a crucial role in advancing the accuracy and reliability of seismic data analysis, structural health monitoring, and risk assessment.

### 10.10 Scalable and Distributed Machine Learning

Scalable and distributed machine learning (SDML) has emerged as a critical paradigm for handling the vast and complex data generated in earthquake engineering. With the increasing availability of high-resolution seismic data, real-time monitoring systems, and large-scale simulations, the need for machine learning models that can efficiently process and analyze this data has become paramount. Traditional machine learning approaches often struggle with computational bottlenecks, data heterogeneity, and the need for high-performance computing, which makes SDML an essential tool for advancing earthquake engineering research and applications. This subsection explores the potential of scalable and distributed machine learning techniques in addressing the challenges of large-scale seismic data and complex simulations in earthquake engineering.

One of the primary challenges in earthquake engineering is the sheer volume of seismic data generated by modern monitoring systems. Seismic stations, satellite imagery, and sensor networks produce vast amounts of data that must be processed and analyzed in real time. For instance, the work by QuakeSet [90] highlights the importance of satellite-based seismic monitoring, but the processing of such data requires high computational resources. Scalable machine learning techniques, such as distributed computing frameworks and parallel processing algorithms, can help overcome these limitations. By leveraging distributed systems like Apache Spark or Hadoop, researchers can process and analyze large seismic datasets more efficiently, enabling real-time insights and faster decision-making.

In addition to handling large datasets, earthquake engineering also involves complex simulations of seismic events, structural responses, and hazard assessments. These simulations often require significant computational power and time. For example, the work by Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction [10] demonstrates the use of deep learning models to simulate fault behavior under various conditions. However, such models can be computationally intensive, especially when trained on high-resolution data. Scalable and distributed machine learning techniques can help reduce the computational burden by distributing the training process across multiple nodes, thereby accelerating model convergence and improving scalability.

Another important aspect of SDML in earthquake engineering is its ability to handle heterogeneous data sources. Seismic data comes from a variety of sensors, including seismometers, accelerometers, and satellite-based systems, each with different characteristics and formats. Integrating and analyzing this diverse data requires robust machine learning models that can adapt to varying input structures. For example, the work by NADBenchmarks [194] emphasizes the importance of benchmark datasets in evaluating machine learning models for disaster-related tasks. By using scalable and distributed machine learning techniques, researchers can build models that are capable of handling different data modalities and formats, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions.

Moreover, the integration of machine learning with physics-based models is a growing area of research in earthquake engineering. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and hybrid AI-physical models are being developed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of predictions by incorporating domain-specific knowledge. The work by Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Seismic Response Prediction of Nonlinear Steel Moment Resisting Frame Structures [7] illustrates how physics-informed models can be used to simulate the behavior of structures under seismic loads. However, training these models often requires large datasets and significant computational resources. Scalable and distributed machine learning techniques can help overcome these challenges by enabling efficient model training and deployment, even in resource-constrained environments.

The use of distributed machine learning is also essential for real-time earthquake monitoring and early warning systems. For example, the work by Generalized Neural Networks for Real-Time Earthquake Early Warning [22] demonstrates how neural networks can be used to detect and predict earthquakes in real time. However, the real-time processing of seismic data requires efficient algorithms and distributed computing infrastructure. By leveraging scalable and distributed machine learning, researchers can build systems that can process and analyze seismic data in real time, enabling faster and more accurate early warning alerts.

In addition to computational efficiency, scalability and distribution also play a crucial role in ensuring the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models in earthquake engineering. The work by Neural Network Applications in Earthquake Prediction (1994-2019) [3] highlights the limitations of traditional neural networks in handling complex seismic data. By using scalable and distributed machine learning techniques, researchers can build models that are not only more accurate but also more resilient to data sparsity and noise. This is particularly important in earthquake engineering, where data scarcity and uncertainty are common challenges.

Another important consideration in SDML is the need for efficient data storage and retrieval. Seismic data is often stored in distributed databases or cloud storage systems, which require efficient data access and management. The work by Global Mapping of Exposure and Physical Vulnerability Dynamics in Least Developed Countries using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning [54] demonstrates the use of remote sensing data for vulnerability assessment. By integrating scalable and distributed machine learning with cloud-based storage solutions, researchers can build systems that can efficiently process and analyze large-scale seismic data.

In summary, scalable and distributed machine learning techniques have the potential to transform earthquake engineering by enabling the efficient processing and analysis of large-scale seismic data and complex simulations. By leveraging distributed computing frameworks, parallel processing algorithms, and cloud-based storage solutions, researchers can build models that are more accurate, efficient, and robust. As the field of earthquake engineering continues to evolve, the integration of scalable and distributed machine learning will be essential for addressing the challenges of data scarcity, computational complexity, and real-time monitoring.

### 10.11 Ethical and Societal Implications

The application of machine learning in earthquake engineering, while promising, raises significant ethical and societal implications that must be carefully considered. These concerns encompass issues of data privacy, fairness, and the potential impact on communities, particularly in regions vulnerable to seismic activity. As machine learning models become integral to earthquake prediction, structural health monitoring, and risk assessment, it is crucial to address these challenges to ensure responsible and equitable deployment.

One of the primary ethical concerns is data privacy. Machine learning models often rely on vast datasets, including seismic data, sensor readings, and even personal information from communities affected by earthquakes. The collection and use of such data can raise privacy issues, especially if the data is not anonymized or if the consent of individuals is not adequately obtained. For instance, in the context of structural health monitoring, data from buildings and infrastructure may be collected continuously, potentially exposing sensitive information about occupants and their activities. This data can be misused or mishandled, leading to breaches of privacy and potential harm to individuals. The paper "Data Excellence for AI: Why Should You Care" highlights the importance of data quality and integrity, emphasizing that the ethical use of data is fundamental to the success and trustworthiness of machine learning systems [224].

Another critical aspect is fairness. Machine learning models can inadvertently perpetuate or even exacerbate existing biases if the training data is not representative of all communities. For example, if the data used to train a model for earthquake prediction is predominantly collected from urban areas, the model may perform poorly in rural or underrepresented regions. This can lead to unequal distribution of resources and attention, leaving vulnerable communities at greater risk. The paper "TRAPDOOR: Repurposing backdoors to detect dataset bias in machine learning-based genomic analysis" addresses the issue of dataset bias, showing how biased datasets can lead to inaccurate predictions and further systemic discrimination [225]. In the context of earthquake engineering, similar issues can arise if the data used to train models is not diverse enough, leading to models that fail to generalize well across different regions and populations.

The impact on communities is another significant ethical consideration. Machine learning models used for earthquake prediction and risk assessment can influence public policy, emergency response strategies, and resource allocation. If these models are not transparent or if their predictions are not clearly communicated, they can lead to misinformation or panic. For example, an inaccurate prediction of an earthquake could result in unnecessary evacuations, causing economic and social disruption. Conversely, an underestimation of risk could lead to a lack of preparedness, putting lives and property at risk. The paper "Explaining black boxes with a SMILE: Statistical Model-agnostic Interpretability with Local Explanations" emphasizes the importance of interpretability in machine learning models, particularly in critical applications such as earthquake engineering [221]. Ensuring that models are not only accurate but also interpretable is essential for building trust and ensuring that communities are well-informed and prepared.

Moreover, the deployment of machine learning models in earthquake engineering can have broader societal implications. For instance, the use of these models in disaster response and recovery efforts can affect the distribution of aid and the prioritization of affected areas. If the models are biased or if their predictions are not accurately validated, they can lead to inequitable resource allocation, further marginalizing already vulnerable communities. The paper "Ecosystem-level Analysis of Deployed Machine Learning Reveals Homogeneous Outcomes" highlights the systemic failures that can occur when models are deployed in real-world contexts, showing that some users are consistently misclassified by all models [63]. In the context of earthquake engineering, similar issues can arise, where certain communities may be systematically overlooked or misclassified, leading to inadequate support and resources.

Additionally, the ethical implications of machine learning in earthquake engineering extend to the environmental and social impacts of model deployment. The computational resources required to train and deploy complex machine learning models can have significant environmental costs, including high energy consumption and carbon emissions. This raises questions about the sustainability of these technologies and their long-term impact on the environment. The paper "Efficient and Robust Machine Learning for Real-World Systems" discusses the importance of resource efficiency in machine learning, highlighting the need for models that are not only effective but also sustainable [60]. In earthquake engineering, where real-time data processing and analysis are critical, it is essential to develop models that are both effective and environmentally responsible.

The ethical and societal implications of machine learning in earthquake engineering also include the need for transparency and accountability. As these models become increasingly integrated into critical infrastructure and decision-making processes, it is crucial to ensure that they are transparent, explainable, and accountable. This requires not only technical advancements but also the development of regulatory frameworks and ethical guidelines that govern the use of machine learning in this domain. The paper "Interpretable Machine Learning: Fundamental Principles and 10 Grand Challenges" outlines the importance of interpretability in machine learning, emphasizing that the ability to understand and explain model predictions is essential for building trust and ensuring accountability [59]. In earthquake engineering, where the stakes are high and the consequences of errors can be severe, the need for transparency and accountability is even more critical.

In conclusion, the ethical and societal implications of applying machine learning in earthquake engineering are multifaceted and require careful consideration. From data privacy and fairness to the impact on communities and environmental sustainability, these issues must be addressed to ensure that the deployment of machine learning models is responsible, equitable, and beneficial for all. By drawing on the insights and recommendations from existing research, we can work towards developing machine learning systems that are not only effective but also ethically sound and socially responsible.

These models leverage large datasets and can predict even abnormal seismic intensity distributions, which is a challenge for conventional methods.

Machine learning is also used to enhance the resilience of critical infrastructure, such as power systems, by improving the capacity of affected areas through dynamic resource deployment [226]. This includes the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to optimize emergency response and resource allocation. In addition, physics-guided models, such as the Physics-Informed Convolutional Neural Network (PhyCNN), have been developed to predict structural responses accurately without relying on physics-based analytical models [79]. These models incorporate physical constraints to improve robustness and reduce the need for large training datasets.

Interpretable models, such as the glass-box model for predicting seismic failure modes of reinforced concrete shear walls, have been proposed to provide engineers with transparent decision-making tools [4]. These models balance accuracy and interpretability, making them more practical for engineering applications. Similarly, explainable boosting machines have been used to predict the deformation capacity of non-ductile reinforced concrete shear walls based on experimental data [52]. These models enable users to understand the relationship between wall properties and deformation capacity, which is crucial for practical applications.

Reinforcement learning has also been applied to control earthquake-like instabilities, demonstrating the potential of deep reinforcement learning techniques in mitigating seismic events [25]. This approach can be extended to industrial projects, such as geothermal energy and CO2 sequestration, to minimize seismicity. In addition, deep learning models, such as the Neuro-DynaStress framework, have been developed to predict dynamic stress distributions in structural components in real-time [93]. These models offer a computationally efficient alternative to traditional high-fidelity methods like finite element analysis.

Seismic response prediction models, such as physics-informed recurrent neural networks, have been proposed to evaluate the dynamic response of nonlinear structures [92]. These models incorporate physical laws to improve accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, attention-based models, such as the CNN-BiLSTM model with attention mechanism, have been developed to predict earthquake occurrences and magnitudes [76]. These models leverage spatial and temporal dependencies to improve prediction performance.

In the context of earthquake early warning systems, deep learning techniques have been applied to detect earthquakes and estimate source parameters from continuous seismic waveforms [5]. These systems can provide early warnings with high accuracy and low latency, which is essential for mitigating seismic hazards. Similarly, cross-layer protocols have been designed to maintain connectivity in earthquake monitoring sensor networks in the absence of communication infrastructure [227]. These protocols ensure reliable data transmission and early warning capabilities.

Overall, machine learning has significantly advanced earthquake engineering by improving hazard prediction, risk assessment, and structural resilience. These techniques provide more accurate, efficient, and interpretable solutions compared to traditional methods, making them invaluable for disaster mitigation and response.

### 11.2 Transformative Potential of Machine Learning

[18]

The transformative potential of machine learning in earthquake engineering is profound, offering new ways to enhance earthquake prediction, monitoring, and risk assessment. Machine learning has revolutionized the field by enabling more accurate and efficient analysis of seismic data, improving the reliability of predictions, and supporting decision-making in disaster management. With the integration of advanced algorithms and the availability of vast datasets, machine learning has significantly improved our understanding of seismic phenomena and the behavior of structures under seismic loads.

One of the most notable contributions of machine learning is in the field of earthquake prediction. Traditional methods for predicting earthquakes often rely on statistical models and empirical data, but they struggle with the high levels of uncertainty and complexity inherent in seismic events. Machine learning, particularly deep learning, has shown promise in overcoming these limitations. For instance, deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been successfully applied to detect and classify seismic events with high accuracy [167]. These models can process large volumes of seismic data, identify patterns, and make predictions in real-time, which is crucial for early warning systems. The study by [167] highlights how machine learning models can be integrated with physics-based knowledge to improve the accuracy of predictions, making them more reliable and interpretable.

In earthquake monitoring, machine learning has enabled the development of more sophisticated and efficient systems for real-time data analysis. For example, the study by [13] demonstrates how Bayesian inference and generative models can be used to detect weak seismic events from noisy sensor data. This approach not only improves the sensitivity of monitoring systems but also reduces the number of false positives, making the system more reliable. Similarly, [14] shows how deep learning techniques can be used to analyze seismic waveforms and identify potential earthquake events, enabling faster and more accurate responses.

Machine learning has also transformed earthquake risk assessment by providing more comprehensive and accurate tools for evaluating the potential impact of seismic events. Traditional risk assessment methods often rely on simplified models and assumptions that may not capture the full complexity of seismic hazards. Machine learning models, on the other hand, can incorporate a wide range of variables, including geological data, historical seismic records, and environmental factors, to provide more accurate risk assessments. The study by [12] highlights how machine learning can be used to estimate the probability of earthquake occurrences and assess the potential damage to structures and communities. By leveraging data-driven approaches, these models can provide more reliable and actionable insights for disaster management and planning.

Another significant area where machine learning has made a transformative impact is in structural health monitoring. Traditional methods for monitoring the integrity of structures often rely on manual inspections and physical sensors, which can be time-consuming and costly. Machine learning models, particularly those based on deep learning, have shown great potential in automating this process. The study by [12] demonstrates how deep learning techniques can be used to detect and classify structural damage in buildings, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. By analyzing vibration data and sensor readings, these models can identify anomalies and predict potential failures, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing the risk of catastrophic failures.

The integration of machine learning with physics-based models has also been a key area of innovation in earthquake engineering. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and hybrid AI-physical models have been developed to combine the strengths of machine learning and traditional physics-based simulations. These models ensure that predictions are not only data-driven but also physically consistent, enhancing their reliability and interpretability. The study by [7] shows how physics-informed machine learning can be used to model the seismic responses of nonlinear structures, providing more accurate and robust predictions. By incorporating physical laws into the training process, these models can overcome the limitations of purely data-driven approaches and offer more trustworthy results.

Furthermore, machine learning has facilitated the development of more efficient and scalable solutions for seismic data analysis and processing. The study by [166] demonstrates how machine learning can be used to create surrogate models that approximate the behavior of complex systems. These models can significantly reduce the computational cost of simulations, making it possible to analyze large-scale seismic events more efficiently. By leveraging techniques such as singular value decomposition (SVD), these models can handle high-dimensional data and provide accurate predictions with minimal computational resources.

The use of machine learning in seismic imaging and inversion has also led to significant advancements in understanding the subsurface structure of the Earth. Traditional seismic inversion methods often face challenges due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem and the limited availability of high-quality data. Machine learning techniques, particularly generative models and physics-informed learning, have been used to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of seismic inversion. The study by [80] presents a novel hybrid seismic inversion method that combines coordinate-based learning with the physics of the post-stack modeling operator. This approach not only improves the accuracy of seismic imaging but also allows for more efficient and scalable inversion processes.

In addition to these technical advancements, machine learning has also contributed to the development of more robust and interpretable models for earthquake engineering. The study by [4] highlights how interpretable machine learning models can provide insights into the decision-making process of complex systems. By using decision trees and other transparent models, engineers can better understand the factors that influence seismic failure modes and make more informed decisions. Similarly, the study by [52] demonstrates how explainable machine learning models can be used to predict the deformation capacity of non-ductile reinforced concrete shear walls, providing valuable insights for structural design and safety assessment.

Overall, the transformative potential of machine learning in earthquake engineering is evident in its ability to enhance prediction, monitoring, and risk assessment. By leveraging advanced algorithms and large datasets, machine learning has opened up new possibilities for understanding and mitigating seismic risks. The integration of machine learning with physics-based models and the development of interpretable and robust models have further expanded the field's capabilities. As research in this area continues to evolve, it is clear that machine learning will play an increasingly important role in shaping the future of earthquake engineering.

### 11.3 Integration of Machine Learning with Domain Knowledge

The integration of machine learning with domain-specific knowledge, particularly physics-based models, plays a pivotal role in ensuring the reliability, interpretability, and robustness of predictions in earthquake engineering. While machine learning models, especially deep learning techniques, have demonstrated impressive performance in tasks such as earthquake detection, structural health monitoring, and seismic data analysis, their effectiveness is often constrained by the lack of adherence to physical laws and domain-specific principles. This limitation becomes increasingly critical in high-stakes applications where interpretability and physical consistency are paramount. By combining data-driven models with domain knowledge, researchers can develop more trustworthy, interpretable, and generalizable solutions that bridge the gap between empirical data and scientific understanding.  

One of the most compelling arguments for integrating machine learning with domain knowledge is the need to ensure that models adhere to the fundamental laws of physics. Seismic events are governed by complex physical processes, including fault mechanics, wave propagation, and material deformation. Traditional physics-based models, such as those based on the equations of motion and constitutive relations, are well-established in seismology and earthquake engineering. However, these models often require significant computational resources and are limited in their ability to handle large, heterogeneous datasets. Machine learning models, on the other hand, excel at learning patterns from data but may produce physically unrealistic predictions if not properly constrained. The integration of physics-based knowledge into machine learning models helps to address this issue by embedding physical constraints directly into the training process. For instance, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been proposed as a way to ensure that deep learning models satisfy the governing equations of the problem, such as the elastic wave equation or the rate-and-state friction laws [10]. This approach not only improves the accuracy of predictions but also enhances the interpretability of the models by ensuring that their outputs are consistent with known physical principles.  

Another important aspect of integrating machine learning with domain knowledge is the ability to incorporate expert insights and empirical laws into the model-building process. In earthquake engineering, there are well-established empirical relationships, such as the Gutenberg-Richter law, which describe the statistical distribution of earthquake magnitudes. These relationships can be used to guide the design of machine learning models, ensuring that they align with the expected behavior of seismic systems. For example, in the context of earthquake prediction, models that are trained on data without accounting for these empirical laws may produce unreliable predictions, especially for rare or extreme events. By embedding domain knowledge into the training process, researchers can improve the generalization performance of machine learning models and ensure that they capture the underlying physical mechanisms that govern seismic phenomena. This approach is particularly useful in applications where the amount of labeled data is limited, as it allows models to leverage prior knowledge to make more accurate predictions [3].  

In addition to improving the reliability and interpretability of predictions, the integration of machine learning with domain knowledge also enhances the robustness of models in the face of uncertainty. Seismic data is often noisy, sparse, and incomplete, making it challenging to train models that are both accurate and generalizable. By incorporating domain-specific knowledge, such as the physical properties of the subsurface or the characteristics of seismic waves, researchers can develop models that are more resilient to data variability and missing information. For example, in the context of structural health monitoring, models that are informed by physics-based simulations can better distinguish between normal operational behavior and actual damage, even when the data is noisy or incomplete [4]. Similarly, in seismic inversion and waveform analysis, models that are constrained by physical principles can better handle the challenges of noise suppression, data interpolation, and pattern recognition, leading to more accurate and reliable results [23; 28].  

The importance of integrating machine learning with domain knowledge is further underscored by the increasing complexity of seismic systems and the growing demand for real-time monitoring and early warning systems. Traditional physics-based models are often too slow or too computationally expensive to be used in real-time applications, while purely data-driven models may lack the interpretability and robustness required for critical decision-making. By combining the strengths of both approaches, researchers can develop hybrid models that are both accurate and efficient. For instance, physics-informed machine learning frameworks have been proposed to enhance the performance of real-time earthquake early warning systems by incorporating physical constraints into the model training process [22; 5]. These models can provide accurate predictions while ensuring that the outputs are consistent with the underlying physical processes, making them more suitable for use in safety-critical applications.  

Moreover, the integration of machine learning with domain knowledge is essential for addressing the challenges of model generalization and out-of-distribution performance. Seismic data is often collected from specific regions or under particular conditions, making it difficult to apply models trained on one dataset to a different setting. By incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the model design, researchers can develop models that are more adaptable to new environments and can generalize better to unseen data. For example, in the context of multi-task learning and domain adaptation, models that are informed by physical principles can better handle the challenges of transferring knowledge across different seismic regions or sensor configurations [145; 134].  

In conclusion, the integration of machine learning with domain knowledge, particularly physics-based models, is a critical step in advancing the field of earthquake engineering. By embedding physical principles into the training process, researchers can develop models that are more reliable, interpretable, and robust, ensuring that they produce predictions that are consistent with the underlying physical mechanisms. This approach not only enhances the accuracy and generalizability of machine learning models but also ensures that they are suitable for use in safety-critical applications. As the field continues to evolve, the development of more sophisticated hybrid models that combine the strengths of data-driven and physics-based approaches will be essential for addressing the complex challenges of earthquake prediction, monitoring, and risk assessment [10; 79].

### 11.4 Challenges and Opportunities for Future Research

The surveyed literature in machine learning (ML) for earthquake engineering reveals several critical challenges that hinder the widespread adoption and effectiveness of ML models in this domain. One of the most prominent challenges is data scarcity, which is a common issue across multiple studies. For instance, many seismic datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to train robust and generalizable models. The paper titled *Data-Driven Prediction of Seismic Intensity Distributions Featuring Hybrid Classification-Regression Models* [8] highlights the difficulties in obtaining sufficient high-quality seismic data for training, which limits the model’s ability to generalize across different seismic regions. Similarly, the paper *SeismoGen: Seismic Waveform Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks* [28] emphasizes the importance of synthetic data generation to overcome the limitations of real-world data, especially in cases where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain. This suggests that future research should focus on improving data augmentation techniques and leveraging synthetic data to enhance model training and performance.

Another key challenge identified in the literature is model generalization, which refers to the ability of ML models to perform well on unseen or out-of-distribution data. Several studies, such as *Generalized Neural Networks for Real-Time Earthquake Early Warning* [22], point out that models trained in specific regions often struggle to generalize to other areas due to differences in seismic characteristics and sensor configurations. This is further compounded by the fact that seismic data is often highly variable and non-stationary, making it difficult for models to capture the underlying patterns consistently. The paper *Exploring Challenges in Deep Learning of Single-Station Ground Motion Records* [75] also highlights the limitations of current deep learning models in handling single-station ground motion recordings, emphasizing the need for more robust and adaptable models that can generalize across different sensor setups and seismic conditions.

Interpretability and explainability of ML models also present significant challenges, particularly in critical applications such as earthquake prediction and structural health monitoring. Many deep learning models used in earthquake engineering are considered "black-box" systems, making it difficult for engineers and decision-makers to understand how the models arrive at their predictions. This lack of transparency can hinder the adoption of ML models in real-world scenarios where trust and accountability are crucial. The paper *Glass-box model representation of seismic failure mode prediction for conventional RC shear walls* [4] addresses this issue by proposing a more interpretable model that allows engineers to understand the decision-making process of the model. Similarly, the paper *Explainable AI models for predicting liquefaction-induced lateral spreading* [17] demonstrates how explainable AI techniques, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), can be used to enhance the transparency of ML models and make them more trustworthy for critical engineering decisions.

Another important challenge is the computational efficiency and scalability of ML models, especially in real-time applications such as earthquake early warning systems. Many of the deep learning models presented in the literature are computationally intensive, requiring significant resources for training and inference. This can be a major barrier to their deployment in real-world scenarios where real-time processing is essential. The paper *Velocity continuation with Fourier neural operators for accelerated uncertainty quantification* [184] explores ways to improve computational efficiency by using Fourier neural operators to accelerate seismic imaging and uncertainty quantification. Similarly, the paper *Parallel Computation of PDFs on Big Spatial Data Using Spark* [212] presents a scalable solution for computing probability density functions (PDFs) on large spatial datasets using parallel computing frameworks like Spark. These approaches suggest that future research should focus on developing more efficient and scalable ML algorithms that can handle large-scale seismic data and support real-time processing.

Despite these challenges, the surveyed literature also highlights several promising opportunities for future research. One such opportunity is the integration of physics-informed learning, which combines ML with domain-specific knowledge to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions. The paper *Physics-Informed Deep Learning of Rate-and-State Fault Friction* [10] demonstrates how physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can be used to ensure that ML models adhere to physical constraints, making them more reliable for earthquake prediction and fault analysis. This suggests that future research should focus on developing more sophisticated physics-informed models that can incorporate domain-specific knowledge and improve the interpretability of ML predictions.

Another promising research direction is the use of transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques to overcome data scarcity and improve model generalization. The paper *Transfer Learning for Seismic Data* [103] highlights the potential of transfer learning in seismic data analysis, where models pre-trained on large datasets can be adapted to specific seismic tasks with minimal additional training. This approach can help address the issue of data scarcity and improve the performance of ML models in different seismic regions. Similarly, the paper *Deep Learning for Earthquake Detection and Prediction* [14] discusses the use of domain adaptation techniques to improve the performance of ML models across different seismic datasets. These findings suggest that future research should focus on developing more effective transfer learning and domain adaptation methods that can leverage data from related tasks and domains to improve model performance.

In conclusion, the surveyed literature highlights several key challenges that need to be addressed to advance the use of ML in earthquake engineering. These challenges include data scarcity, model generalization, interpretability, and computational efficiency. However, the literature also presents promising opportunities for future research, such as the development of physics-informed models, the use of transfer learning, and the exploration of more efficient and scalable ML algorithms. By addressing these challenges and leveraging these opportunities, researchers can further enhance the accuracy, reliability, and practicality of ML models in earthquake engineering.

Another study demonstrated that generalized neural networks trained on diverse datasets can reliably report earthquake locations and magnitudes within seconds, significantly improving the effectiveness of early warning systems [22]. These advancements highlight the potential of machine learning to revolutionize earthquake early warning systems, making them more reliable and responsive.

Post-disaster assessments are essential for understanding the extent of damage and guiding recovery efforts. Machine learning techniques, such as computer vision and deep learning, have been employed to analyze satellite and drone imagery for damage detection. For example, a study used a synthetic dataset to train deep learning models for detecting building damage, achieving high accuracy in identifying defects and estimating the technical condition of structures [155]. Another paper described a framework that combines deep learning with self-supervised learning to classify seismic events and detect anomalies in structural health monitoring [87]. These approaches not only enhance the speed of damage assessment but also improve the accuracy of evaluations, providing critical information for post-disaster response and reconstruction.

Resource allocation is another critical aspect of disaster management, where machine learning has shown significant promise. By analyzing historical data and real-time information, machine learning models can optimize the deployment of emergency services, distribution of aid, and management of shelters and medical facilities. For instance, a study on the use of social media data for disaster response highlighted how machine learning can analyze public sentiment and information sharing during earthquakes, aiding in decision-making and resource allocation [91]. Additionally, the integration of geospatial data with machine learning models has enabled more efficient evacuation planning and route optimization during emergencies [228]. These applications demonstrate the potential of machine learning to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of resource allocation in disaster scenarios.

In addition to these direct applications, machine learning has also contributed to the development of more accurate and reliable earthquake risk assessment models. These models incorporate various factors, such as historical seismic activity, environmental conditions, and structural characteristics, to predict the likelihood and potential impact of future earthquakes. A study on the use of explainable boosting machines for estimating the deformation capacity of non-ductile reinforced concrete shear walls demonstrated the importance of interpretability in machine learning models for critical applications like earthquake risk assessment [52]. Another paper discussed the integration of physics-informed machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of seismic response predictions [7]. These models not only improve the accuracy of risk assessments but also provide valuable insights for disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies.

The impact of machine learning on disaster management and public safety extends beyond technical applications to ethical and societal considerations. As machine learning models become more integrated into disaster response systems, it is essential to address issues related to data privacy, bias, and the potential for misuse of predictive models. A study on the ethical and social implications of using machine learning in disaster management emphasized the need for responsible AI practices and transparent decision-making processes [106]. Ensuring that machine learning models are fair, interpretable, and aligned with ethical guidelines is crucial for building public trust and ensuring the equitable distribution of resources.

In conclusion, machine learning has had a profound impact on disaster management and public safety in earthquake engineering. By enhancing early warning systems, improving post-disaster assessments, and optimizing resource allocation, these technologies have transformed traditional approaches to managing seismic events. The integration of machine learning with physics-based models and the development of interpretable and explainable models further contribute to the reliability and effectiveness of these systems. As the field continues to evolve, addressing ethical and societal considerations will be essential for ensuring the responsible and equitable use of machine learning in disaster management and public safety.

### 11.6 Call for Continued Research and Development

[229] The integration of machine learning with physics-based models has shown great promise in improving the accuracy and reliability of predictions in earthquake engineering. For instance, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been developed to incorporate physical laws and constraints into the training of neural networks, enhancing their generalizability and interpretability [7]. However, despite these advancements, there is still a need for further research to refine these hybrid models and ensure their robustness across different seismic scenarios. Future studies should focus on developing more efficient algorithms that can handle the complexity of physical systems while maintaining computational feasibility. Additionally, the integration of domain knowledge with machine learning techniques, as demonstrated in the work on physics-guided convolutional neural networks (PhyCNN) [79], should be explored further to ensure that the models are not only accurate but also interpretable and reliable.

[230] The field of machine learning in earthquake engineering also faces significant challenges related to data scarcity and quality. Seismic data is often limited, and the quality of the data can vary significantly, making it difficult to train robust and generalizable models. While techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and self-supervised learning have been proposed to address these challenges [103; 27], there is still a need for more innovative approaches to improve the availability and quality of seismic data. Future research should focus on developing more effective data augmentation techniques, exploring the use of synthetic data to supplement real-world datasets, and improving the integration of multimodal data sources to enhance the robustness of machine learning models.

[231] Another critical area for continued research is the development of explainable and interpretable machine learning models.

However, there is still a need for more advanced generative models that can capture the complex characteristics of seismic data and generate high-fidelity synthetic datasets. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated generative models that can effectively simulate various seismic scenarios and improve the robustness of machine learning models in earthquake engineering.

[235] The development of adaptive and self-supervised learning techniques is another critical area for future research. As the characteristics of seismic data can vary significantly over time and across different regions, there is a need for machine learning models that can adapt to these changes and maintain their performance. Techniques such as transfer learning and domain adaptation have been proposed to address these challenges [103; 7], but there is still a need for more advanced and robust methods that can handle the complexities of seismic data. Future research should focus on developing more adaptive and self-supervised learning techniques that can effectively handle the challenges of data drift and domain shifts in earthquake engineering.

[236] The need for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in the field of machine learning for earthquake engineering cannot be overstated. The integration of machine learning with traditional seismological methods requires a deep understanding of both the computational and physical aspects of seismic data. Future research should focus on fostering collaboration between computer scientists, seismologists, and engineers to develop more effective and efficient machine learning models for earthquake engineering. Additionally, the development of open-source frameworks and tools, such as the SeisT model [15], can help in accelerating the adoption of machine learning techniques in earthquake engineering and promoting the sharing of knowledge and resources.

[236] The ethical and societal implications of using machine learning in earthquake engineering must also be considered. The use of AI-driven solutions in critical applications such as earthquake prediction and risk assessment requires careful consideration of issues such as data privacy, bias, and the potential for misuse. Future research should focus on developing ethical guidelines and frameworks for the responsible use of machine learning in earthquake engineering. Additionally, the development of fair and unbiased machine learning models is crucial to ensure that the predictions made by these models are reliable and equitable.

[236] In conclusion, continued research and development in the field of machine learning for earthquake engineering are essential to address the challenges and limitations that currently exist. The integration of machine learning with physics-based models, the development of explainable and interpretable models, and the use of real-time data processing and edge computing are all critical areas that require further exploration. Additionally, the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation, as well as the ethical and societal implications of using machine learning in earthquake engineering, must be addressed to ensure the responsible and effective application of these technologies. By continuing to advance the field of machine learning for earthquake engineering, we can develop more accurate, reliable, and efficient solutions to improve earthquake prediction, monitoring, and risk assessment.
