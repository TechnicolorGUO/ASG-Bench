Governments act as regulators and enablers, balancing platform economies with local social responsibilities [70]. Their role is crucial in establishing supportive policies that encourage innovation while safeguarding public interests. Policies must reconcile technological adoption incentives, like Industry 4.0 investments, with cybersecurity safeguards and workforce reskilling [17]. The telecom sector exemplifies this balance, where AIGC applications demand adaptive governance to ensure data privacy without stifling innovation [86]. Challenges persist in aligning individual rights, like the right to erasure, with collective environmental interests, particularly in sustainable AI regulation [9].\n\nUniversities contribute through human capital development and research translation, yet face misalignment between traditional curricula and industry needs. Digital education platforms like MOOCs bridge this gap, though demographic shifts and content relevance challenges remain [87]. Collaborative initiatives like BlockMEDC showcase academia-industry synergies, where blockchain-based credentialing systems enhance interoperability and reduce administrative burdens [76]. However, fragmented incident ownership in innovation processes often leads to superficial solutions rather than systemic improvements [88], underscoring the need for structured stakeholder feedback mechanisms.\n\nInvestors and corporations drive resource allocation but face ethical dilemmas in digital transformation. VR/AR technologies illustrate these tensions, where AI integration risks data security vulnerabilities and reduced human-centric interactions [89]. Privacy-preserving technologies, like data-minimizing certificate chaining in self-sovereign identity systems, offer partial solutions but lack comprehensive revocation mechanisms [77]. Industrial benchmarks like PCBVisions imaging for e-waste recycling demonstrate investor-supported RD catalyzing cross-sector collaboration [14], though technological lock-in remains a barrier.\n\nThe prosumer economy model, integrating producers and consumers in circular systems, highlights community stakeholders’ role in driving sustainable transitions [28]. Trust mechanisms are critical in multi-stakeholder environments, where autonomous systems and unpredictable contexts create trust deficits [83]. Public procurement frameworks illustrate stakeholder tensions, as circular procurement practices often conflict with non-discrimination principles in international trade [85]. Addressing these conflicts requires innovative policy solutions balancing sustainability with global trade realities.\n\nEmerging frameworks emphasize hybrid governance models integrating machine learning for decision optimizationleveraging techniques from SVM to Deep Q-Networks [90]while maintaining stakeholder accountability. Future strategies must prioritize adaptive policy instruments reconciling entrepreneurial agility with long-term sustainability goals, particularly in resource-intensive sectors.
