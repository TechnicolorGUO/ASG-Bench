SurveyX is an AI-powered system designed to automate the generation of surveys. While it aims to produce high-quality, coherent, and comprehensive surveys with accurate citations, the final output is derived from the AI’s synthesis of pre-processed materials, which may contain limitations or inaccuracies. As such, the generated content should not be used for academic publication or formal submissions and must be independently reviewed and verified. The developers of SurveyX do not assume responsibility for any errors or consequences arising from the use of the generated surveys.
