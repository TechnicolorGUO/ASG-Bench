      "heading": "1.1 Structure of the Survey",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "This survey is organized into nine major sections, each addressing critical aspects of diabetes disparities and health equity. The first section introduces the topic, emphasizing the unequal burden of diabetes prevalence, complications, and outcomes across racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic groups. This introduction sets the stage for understanding how these disparities manifest and the urgent need for focused research and intervention strategies. Following this, Section 2 provides foundational definitions and explores systemic and structural factors contributing to disparities, including key concepts such as health equity and social determinants of health. By establishing a clear framework for the discussion, this section lays the groundwork for subsequent analyses.\n\n![](images/559ee1809f2d3dfc549e0c69170dda162d4c116baf5b49be8358dc375e86d0ec.jpg)  \nFigure 1: chapter structure\n\nSection 3 delves into the impact of social determinants on diabetes disparities, with subsections dedicated to essential factors such as income, education, housing, and food security. Each of these determinants plays a pivotal role in shaping health outcomes, as they influence individuals’ access to resources and healthcare services. For instance, lower income levels are often associated with reduced access to healthy food options and preventive care, exacerbating diabetes risk. Section 4 analyzes socioeconomic factors and their influence on access to care, prevention programs, and diabetes management. This section highlights the barriers faced by disadvantaged populations, such as lack of transportation, inadequate health insurance, and limited availability of culturally competent care.\n\nContinuing the discourse, Section 5 reviews evidence-based prevention strategies, including culturally sensitive interventions and technology-enabled tools. The integration of culturally relevant practices is crucial for engaging diverse populations effectively and ensuring that prevention efforts resonate with their unique needs. Section 6 focuses on diabetes management challenges among disadvantaged populations, discussing technological solutions like continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and digital health technologies (DHTs). These innovations hold promise for improving self-management and health outcomes; however, their accessibility and usability among various demographic groups require further exploration.\n\nSection 7 evaluates public health approaches to reducing disparities, featuring policy reforms and community-based case studies. This section underscores the importance of collaborative efforts between healthcare providers, policymakers, and community organizations in addressing systemic barriers to care. Revised Sentence: \"Section 8 examines community health interventions, focusing on the integration of digital health technologies and traditional strategies to enhance the detection, prevention, and management of conditions such as prediabetes and tuberculosis, while addressing the needs of diverse subpopulations and improving healthcare accessibility.\" This multifaceted approach recognizes the necessity of tailoring interventions to the specific contexts of different communities, ensuring that health equity is pursued comprehensively.\n\nFinally, Section 9 synthesizes key findings and proposes future directions, including policy recommendations and technological advancements to promote health equity in diabetes care. This structure facilitates a thorough exploration of diabetes disparities by seamlessly integrating theoretical frameworks, empirical evidence, and practical interventions. The comprehensive nature of this survey enhances our understanding of user needs for diabetes management, the role of digital health technologies in early detection, and the importance of adherence to clinical guidelines in diverse populations. Such insights are critical for informing future research and practice aimed at mitigating the impact of diabetes on vulnerable communities.The following sections are organized as shown in Figure 1."

      "heading": "2.1 Definition of Diabetes Disparities",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "Diabetes disparities denote the uneven distribution of diabetes prevalence and outcomes across various racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic groups, primarily due to systemic inequities in healthcare and social determinants of health. Marginalized populations face higher diabetes incidence, poor glycemic control, and increased risk of severe complications like cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, and nephropathy. Barriers such as financial constraints, transportation issues, and lack of culturally competent care exacerbate these disparities. Digital health technologies (DHTs) offer potential solutions by enabling remote screening and monitoring, thus aiding in early detection and management of diabetes. The need for intuitive data visualization tools is critical for improving health outcomes in high-risk groups [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The persistent nature of these disparities underscores the necessity for interventions that extend beyond clinical care to embrace a holistic approach to health equity.\n\nThe concept of diabetes disparities involves both biological and sociocultural dimensions, where genetic predispositions intersect with environmental factors like food insecurity and limited healthcare access. Racial and ethnic minorities often encounter delayed diagnoses and inadequate management due to implicit biases and fragmented care within healthcare systems. DHTs can enhance the management of conditions like prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, especially for underserved populations, by capturing diverse health signals and addressing unique subpopulation needs [5, 2, 3, 6]. Socioeconomic status further compounds these disparities, as lower-income groups face barriers to preventive services and diabetes education, crucial for effective disease management.\n\nA pivotal aspect of diabetes disparities is their intersectionality, where overlapping identities such as race, income, and geography amplify health risks. Rural areas exhibit higher diabetes mortality due to physician shortages and transportation barriers, while urban low-income neighborhoods may lack access to affordable healthy foods. Addressing these requires a health equity framework prioritizing targeted interventions for high-risk groups and policy reforms to dismantle structural inequities. The role of DHTs in bridging these gaps is significant, although their implementation must consider accessibility and cultural relevance. Understanding the multifaceted nature of diabetes disparities enables stakeholders to devise strategies that address both medical and broader social determinants contributing to these inequities."

      "heading": "2.2 Key Terms and Concepts",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "Health equity involves eliminating avoidable and unjust disparities in health outcomes, ensuring equitable access to resources necessary for optimal health regardless of social, economic, or demographic background. This is crucial in the context of DHTs, which can target interventions for underserved populations using data-driven approaches to enhance preventive care and treatment accessibility [2, 3, 7, 4, 5]. In diabetes care, health equity implies equitable access to prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management resources, addressing systemic barriers affecting marginalized communities.\n\nSocial determinants of health (SDOH) include conditions like socioeconomic status, education, neighborhood environment, and healthcare access, significantly influencing diabetes risk and outcomes. Studies show strong correlations between adverse SDOH and increased diabetes prevalence and complications. Populations with limited healthcare access, such as rural residents and minorities, are particularly vulnerable, necessitating targeted interventions. Advances in DHTs aim to enhance detection and management of diabetes by focusing on critical health signals and risk factors [4, 2]. For instance, food insecurity and limited access to nutritious foods exacerbate obesity and type 2 diabetes risks.\n\nSocioeconomic factors like income, education, and employment significantly contribute to diabetes disparities by affecting access to affordable healthcare and health literacy. DHTs can enhance detection, prevention, and self-management capabilities, addressing some disparities [2, 3]. Lowerincome groups face financial barriers to medications and routine care, while limited education reduces awareness of prevention strategies. Employment instability disrupts healthcare access and medication adherence, complicating diabetes management. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing interventions to bridge gaps in diabetes care and improve outcomes.\n\nStructural barriers, including systemic racism and unequal resource distribution, perpetuate disparities by reinforcing inequitable conditions. Addressing these requires multilevel interventions integrating policy reforms, community-based programs, and culturally tailored healthcare models. Emerging frameworks emphasize intersectional approaches accounting for overlapping vulnerabilities like race, class, and geography to achieve meaningful progress in diabetes health equity. Recognizing these structural factors enables stakeholders to craft strategies targeting individual health outcomes and broader systemic issues contributing to diabetes disparities."

      "heading": "2.3 Systemic and Structural Factors",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "Systemic and structural factors crucially perpetuate diabetes disparities by reinforcing inequities in healthcare access and social determinants of health. Clinician adherence to guidelines is often inadequate, leading to fragmented care that disproportionately affects marginalized populations [6]. These systemic failures hinder individual outcomes and contribute to the societal burden of diabetes complications.\n\nStructural barriers like censoring and missing surrogate information complicate diabetes outcome assessments, especially in time-to-event data, where existing methods fall short [1]. The lack of robust longitudinal surrogate markers limits accurate evaluation of interventions in diverse populations [8]. Treatment effect heterogeneity in cluster-randomized trials (CRTs) remains unaddressed, as optimal designs often overlook variations in intracluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) [5]. This oversight undermines interventions targeting high-risk groups, necessitating a reevaluation of research practices to address diverse population realities.\n\nMediation analysis reveals complexities where treatment-influenced confounders obscure intervention effects on diabetes outcomes [4]. Methodological gaps hinder identifying causal pathways linking structural factors to disparities. Co-infections and comorbidities like tuberculosis and malnutrition further strain healthcare systems, disproportionately affecting low-resource settings [7]. Addressing these challenges requires understanding systemic factors contributing to health disparities and targeted strategies to mitigate their impact.\n\nChallenges like unbounded adversarial attacks in reward estimation highlight vulnerabilities in datadriven diabetes management approaches, particularly for disadvantaged groups [9]. These systemic inefficiencies necessitate multilevel interventions addressing healthcare delivery and broader social determinants. Future efforts must prioritize methodological rigor, equitable resource allocation, and culturally tailored strategies to effectively mitigate disparities. Collaboration among researchers, policymakers, and community stakeholders can create a more equitable healthcare landscape addressing diabetes disparities’ root causes."

      "heading": "3.1 Impact of Social Determinants on Diabetes",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "SDOH profoundly affect diabetes prevalence, management, and outcomes through interconnected pathways involving socioeconomic status, healthcare access, and environmental conditions. Income inequality correlates with diabetes incidence, as lower-income populations face food deserts, limited recreational spaces, and chronic stress, elevating obesity and insulin resistance risks [6]. Lower socioeconomic groups encounter barriers to accessing healthy foods, critical for diabetes management, and face disparities in care, as evidenced by the DiscovErr system’s findings on type 2 diabetes management [6]. Education level influences diabetes outcomes through health literacy and self-efficacy, with lower educational attainment linked to reduced preventive behaviors and poorer medication adherence [4]. The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study highlights that lifestyle intervention efficacy varies by education, suggesting that educational interventions could improve outcomes among disadvantaged populations. Neighborhood characteristics further compound these effects, with residential segregation concentrating environmental hazards and limiting access to care, disproportionately affecting racial/ethnic minorities [6].\n\nStructural barriers in healthcare systems amplify SDOH impacts. The BiKBAC method reveals systemic biases in treatment prioritization for marginalized populations, leading to differential outcomes [6]. Food insecurity disrupts dietary management, increasing hypoglycemia episodes among insulin-dependent patients. Employment conditions, such as shift work and lack of paid sick leave, complicate routine glucose monitoring and clinic attendance [4]. Addressing these barriers is essential for improving health equity in diabetes care.\n\nEmerging research emphasizes the need for SDOH-aware interventions. The Finnish study’s mediation analysis identifies physical activity and dietary changes as key mechanisms through which socioeconomic factors influence diabetes risk, suggesting targeted strategies for high-vulnerability subgroups [4]. Future directions must integrate SDOH screening into clinical workflows and advocate for policy-level reforms to address upstream determinants like housing instability and transportation barriers, aligning healthcare practices with patients’ social contexts for more effective diabetes management."

      "heading": "3.2 Global and Regional Perspectives",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "Diabetes disparities vary globally and regionally, shaped by divergent social determinants, healthcare infrastructures, and policy environments. In high-income countries, socioeconomic gradients in diabetes prevalence are pronounced, with marginalized racial/ethnic groups experiencing higher incidence rates compared to majority populations [6]. Systemic barriers, such as limited access to culturally competent healthcare, exacerbate these disparities. The BiKBAC analysis of U.S. and European cohorts highlights underutilization of guideline-recommended care in low-income urban neighborhoods, where fragmented health systems and linguistic barriers pose challenges.\n\nIn contrast, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face dual burdens of infectious diseases and rising diabetes rates, with South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa experiencing steep increases due to urbanization and nutrition transitions [7]. Regional variations in structural determinants are evident in care access metrics, with rural populations globally experiencing reduced odds of receiving diabetes screenings compared to urban counterparts [1]. The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study’s longitudinal data show Northern Europe’s success in mitigating disparities through centralized healthcare systems, while Mediterranean countries face persistent gaps due to economic austerity measures [4].\n\nCultural perceptions in Southeast Asia complicate prevention efforts, with studies showing significant underdiagnosis in populations associating obesity with prosperity [8]. Methodological challenges in cross-regional comparisons, including censoring biases and inconsistent surrogate marker validation, hinder effective intervention development [1]. Cluster-randomized trials in LMICs often overlook treatment effect heterogeneity, leading to underestimation of intervention impacts in high-disparity settings [5].\n\nThe co-occurrence of diabetes with endemic conditions like tuberculosis in South Africa illustrates syndemic interactions amplifying disparities, requiring integrated intervention frameworks [7]. Emerging technological solutions show region-specific potential, though adversarial robustness concerns in reward estimation algorithms may disproportionately affect low-resource settings [9]. Future research should focus on regionally adapted disparity metrics that account for local social determinants while maintaining cross-national comparability through advanced causal inference methods [8]. Policymakers must prioritize context-specific strategies, such as mobile health units for remote populations and culturally tailored nutrition programs in urban food deserts, to effectively address geographically stratified disparities.\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, this figure categorizes diabetes disparities across global regions hierarchically, emphasizing the socioeconomic factors influencing high-income countries, the dual disease burdens faced by LMICs, and the varying intervention strategies employed across different regions.\n\n![](images/13fdddf0f62e24a28c802f74fb61574a0641a37239feea3b62d96a60f985b17e.jpg)  \nFigure 2: This figure illustrates the hierarchical categorization of diabetes disparities across global regions, highlighting socioeconomic factors in high-income countries, dual disease burdens in lowand middle-income countries, and varying regional intervention strategies."

      "heading": "4.1 Socioeconomic Factors and Access to Care",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "Socioeconomic factors, including income, education, and employment, significantly affect healthcare access and diabetes management, perpetuating disparities in care quality and outcomes. Financial constraints in lower-income populations hinder access to medications, diagnostic tests, and routine clinical visits [6]. These challenges are exacerbated by the absence of automated systems for evaluating care compliance, particularly affecting marginalized groups requiring assessments tailored to their socioeconomic contexts. Limited resources in low-income neighborhoods, such as scarce or underfunded healthcare facilities, further compound these barriers, resulting in longer wait times and reduced care quality.\n\nEducational attainment influences health literacy and self-management abilities, with lower education levels linked to reduced adherence to medication regimens and preventive behaviors. Healthcare systems often fail to accommodate variations in patient understanding of diabetes pathophysiology and treatment protocols [6]. The interplay between education and health literacy is critical; individuals with lower educational backgrounds may not fully understand the importance of lifestyle modifications or regular blood glucose monitoring. Employment status also impacts disparities, as unstable work schedules and lack of paid leave disrupt continuity of care, glucose monitoring, and attendance at diabetes education programs. Shift workers, for instance, experience higher HbA1c levels due to circadian rhythm disruptions and inconsistent healthcare access, illustrating the direct link between socioeconomic conditions and health outcomes.\n\nStructural inefficiencies in care delivery disproportionately affect socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. The Bidirectional Knowledge-Based Assessment (BiKBAC) methodology reveals inconsistent clinician adherence to diabetes management guidelines, with underserved populations receiving fragmented or suboptimal care [6]. These systemic shortcomings highlight the need for interventions addressing individual-level socioeconomic barriers and institutional biases in healthcare provision. Integrating community resources and support systems into healthcare delivery can enhance access and improve outcomes for vulnerable populations. Future strategies should incorporate socioeconomic screening into clinical workflows and develop adaptive care models accommodating the financial and logistical constraints faced by vulnerable populations."

      "heading": "4.2 Socioeconomic Barriers in Diabetes Prevention Programs",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "Low-income populations face substantial socioeconomic barriers in accessing diabetes prevention programs due to financial constraints, logistical challenges, and systemic inequities in program design and delivery. Cost remains a primary obstacle, as participation often requires out-of-pocket expenses for program fees, transportation, and childcareexpenses frequently unaffordable for individuals with limited financial resources [6]. The absence of insurance coverage for preventive services exacerbates this disparity, particularly in regions lacking universal healthcare systems, deterring individuals from seeking preventive care and leading to unmanaged risk factors contributing to diabetes onset.\n\nGeographic accessibility further limits participation, with rural and underserved urban areas experiencing shortages of program providers and diabetes education specialists. Transportation barriers disproportionately affect low-income participants lacking reliable vehicle or public transit access to attend in-person sessions [1]. Time constraints also pose significant challenges, as inflexible work schedules and multiple job commitments hinder consistent attendance, particularly for hourly wage workers without paid leave benefits, creating a significant gap in preventive service availability and poorer health outcomes among at-risk individuals.\n\nCultural and linguistic mismatches between program content and participant demographics reduce engagement among marginalized groups. Prevention programs often fail to account for cultural dietary preferences, health beliefs, and literacy levels, resulting in lower retention rates among racial/ethnic minorities and non-native language speakers [4]. The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study demonstrated that participants with lower education and income required tailored support to achieve outcomes comparable to higher SES groups, indicating the necessity for culturally competent programming resonating with diverse populations to enhance participation and effectiveness.\n\nStructural biases in program eligibility criteria and recruitment strategies further exacerbate access disparities. Many programs rely on healthcare provider referrals or digital enrollment systems, inadvertently excluding individuals without regular medical care or internet access [8]. Clusterrandomized trials reveal such selection biases lead to underrepresentation of high-risk populations in prevention research, limiting the generalizability of findings to socioeconomically diverse communities [5]. Addressing these biases is essential for creating equitable access to diabetes prevention programs and ensuring all individuals, regardless of socioeconomic status, have participation opportunities.\n\nEmerging solutions include community-based participatory programs integrating prevention services with existing social support networks, such as food banks and housing assistance centers. Digital health technologies show promise in overcoming geographic and temporal barriers, though their effectiveness depends on addressing digital literacy gaps and ensuring equitable device and connectivity access [9].\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 3, the primary socioeconomic barriers in diabetes prevention programs can be categorized into financial constraints, logistical challenges, and cultural/structural barriers. This figure highlights key obstacles such as out-of-pocket costs, geographic accessibility, and cultural mismatches. Future interventions must adopt intersectional approaches addressing financial, logistical, and cultural barriers while advocating for policy reforms to expand insurance coverage for preventive services. Collaboration between healthcare providers, community organizations, and policymakers is crucial for creating an inclusive framework supporting diabetes prevention efforts among vulnerable populations."

It underscores the diversity in intervention strategies and their tailored adaptations according to individual and contextual needs, as referenced in recent academic studies.\n\nLifestyle interventions are fundamental to diabetes prevention, with their effectiveness influenced by behavioral, biological, and socioeconomic factors. These interventions typically include dietary changes, increased physical activity, and weight management. Table 2 provides a comprehensive comparison of different methodologies for lifestyle interventions aimed at diabetes prevention, detailing their constituent components, mediating factors, and adaptability to personalized needs. Figure 4 illustrates the hierarchical structure of lifestyle interventions related to diabetes prevention, categorizing key elements, mediating factors, and methodologies. The BiKBAC method highlights that structured lifestyle programs achieve better outcomes when compliance assessments consider guideline complexity and individual contexts [6]. Weight loss is a critical mediator, with mediation analyses showing $38 5 2 \\%$ of intervention effects on diabetes incidence are through this pathway, particularly in high-risk groups [4]. This underscores the need for sustained lifestyle changes for maximum impact.\n\nTemporal dynamics of surrogate markers further clarify intervention mechanisms. Robust evaluation methods for longitudinal surrogates address censoring challenges in lifestyle trials, quantifying how intermediate outcomes like BMI reduction and improved insulin sensitivity explain treatment effects over time [8]. Survival analysis frameworks reveal that early improvements in physical activity and dietary habits predict long-term diabetes risk reduction [1], emphasizing early interventions for significant long-term benefits.\n\nIntervention response variability necessitates tailored approaches. CRTs often overlook treatment effect variability, especially when intracluster correlations vary across socioeconomic strata [5]. This highlights the need for personalized strategies considering lifestyle, health status, and environmental factors. Quantitative predictive monitoring enhances safety by detecting deviations from expected metabolic trajectories early, allowing real-time adjustments for suboptimal responders [10]. Such adaptability ensures interventions remain effective and relevant.\n\nKey challenges include addressing socioeconomic barriers to program adherence and ensuring equitable access across diverse populations. Future interventions should integrate robust surrogate marker analysis with adaptive designs accounting for heterogeneity, leveraging predictive monitoring for optimal individual outcomes. Emerging methodologies emphasize precision prevention strategies integrating lifestyle modifications tailored to participants’ unique biological and social contexts. This is particularly relevant in digital health technologies (DHTs), utilizing AI and ML to analyze health signals, such as glucose levels and community insights, to identify high-risk populations. By focusing on subgroups like rural residents and minority communities, these strategies aim to enhance interventions through personalized data visualization tools and automated pattern discovery, improving diabetes management outcomes [5, 2, 3].\n\n![](images/ed1ad61e786c899d945f8c9210b935ec6c57a634a7eda0a8e2d9bcb060984502.jpg)  \nFigure 4: This figure illustrates the hierarchical structure of lifestyle interventions related to diabetes prevention, categorizing key elements, mediating factors, and methodologies."
