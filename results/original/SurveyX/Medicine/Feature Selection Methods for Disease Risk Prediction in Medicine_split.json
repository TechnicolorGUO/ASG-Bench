Biomarkers are integral to clinical practice, aiding in early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and treatment evaluation. Advanced techniques like deep learning and neuro-symbolic models enhance biomarker effectiveness by analyzing complex datasets, improving predictive accuracy. For example, machine learning models that integrate demographic and symptomatic data can predict patellofemoral osteoarthritis progression and identify high-risk patients for targeted interventions [1, 2]. Biomarkers are categorized into diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive types, each serving distinct roles. Rigor is necessary for validating these biomarkers to ensure specificity and reproducibility across populations.\n\nBiomarker discovery methods balance the high-throughput capability of genomic approaches with the specificity of targeted proteomic assays. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) enable large-scale biomarker screening, they often lack clinical specificity due to complex interactions. In contrast, targeted assays focus on specific pathways, offering greater interpretability but potentially missing novel biomarkers. Multi-omics integration, combining genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data, is emerging to enhance biomarker robustness and disease mechanism understanding. The biological plausibility of biomarkers and relevance to disease pathways are paramount for clinical application. Machine learning models, advancing understanding of complex diseases, are used to identify composite biomarkers, thereby enhancing predictive models’ power and patient management [1, 2].\n\nFuture biomarker research should focus on dynamic biomarkers and real-time monitoring to track disease trajectories.

These methods can be categorized into three main groups: univariate methods, multivariate techniques, and dimensionality reduction approaches. Each category encompasses specific methodologies that aid in identifying relevant features that contribute to the predictive accuracy of models.\n\nFigure 5 illustrates these traditional statistical methods for feature selection, providing a visual representation that categorizes them effectively. The univariate methods focus on evaluating each feature independently, while multivariate techniques consider the relationships between multiple features. Dimensionality reduction approaches, on the other hand, aim to reduce the number of features while preserving essential information, thus enhancing model performance and interpretability. This categorization not only clarifies the various approaches available but also highlights their applicability in the context of disease prediction and progression studies.\n\n![](images/66534b64f9de2dc4e86d11f1b4e9bfa49d6bb3674d1579611db9a4cb5a4a8211.jpg)  \nFigure 4: This figure illustrates traditional statistical methods for feature selection, categorizing them into univariate methods, multivariate techniques, and dimensionality reduction approaches.

      "content": "Traditional statistical methods for feature selection in disease prediction employ well-established mathematical frameworks to identify relevant variables while maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. This figure illustrates traditional statistical methods for feature selection, categorizing them into univariate methods, multivariate techniques, and dimensionality reduction approaches. Each category contains specific methods employed in disease prediction and progression studies. Univariate statistical tests, such as t-tests for continuous features and chi-square tests for categorical variables, are employed to evaluate and rank features based on their individual discriminative power in distinguishing between different disease states, thereby providing insights into the relative importance of each feature in predicting disease progression [1, 2]. These methods excel in computational simplicity but fail to capture feature interactions critical for complex disease phenotypes. Correlation-based approaches, such as Pearson’s and Spearman’s coefficients, address this limitation by evaluating pairwise relationships between features and the target variable, though they remain susceptible to multicollinearity effects.\n\nMultivariate regression techniques, particularly stepwise selection methods, extend univariate analyses by iteratively adding or removing features based on statistical significance thresholds. Forward selection builds models by progressively incorporating the most significant features, while backward elimination starts with all features and removes the least significant ones. While these methods enhance feature interaction modeling by leveraging advanced techniques such as neuro-symbolic representations and deep learning frameworks, they face challenges related to instability in highdimensional contexts, primarily due to issues arising from multiple testing, which can compromise the reliability of results [1, 2]. Regularized regression approaches, including LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and ridge regression, overcome these limitations by imposing penalty terms on coefficient magnitudes, effectively performing feature selection during model fitting. LASSO’s L1 penalty yields sparse solutions with exact zero coefficients for irrelevant features, making it particularly suitable for genomic data where the number of features vastly exceeds sample sizes.\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) represents a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms correlated features into orthogonal principal components, preserving maximum variance in the data. While not strictly a feature selection method, PCA facilitates feature extraction by identifying latent variables that capture disease-relevant patterns. Factor analysis effectively decomposes observed variables into underlying latent factors, yet the interpretation of these factors within clinical contexts remains complex and challenging, particularly when integrating diverse data types such as imaging and clinical variables, as seen in advanced machine learning models used for predicting disease progression [1, 2]. Information-theoretic approaches, such as mutual information and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) criteria, evaluate both feature relevance and redundancy, offering robust performance across diverse data types.\n\nComparative analyses indicate that traditional feature selection methods often face significant tradeoffs between maintaining statistical rigor and ensuring practical applicability, highlighting the need for innovative approaches that balance these aspects effectively, as demonstrated in recent studies on neuro-symbolic representations and deep learning models for biomedical applications [1, 2]. While univariate methods provide transparent results and rapid computation, they overlook complex biological interactions prevalent in disease mechanisms. Multivariate techniques capture these interactions but require careful tuning of significance thresholds and regularization parameters. The emergence of hybrid statistical-machine learning approaches, such as stability selection combined with LASSO, addresses these limitations by enhancing feature selection robustness through resampling techniques. Future directions emphasize the integration of domain knowledge into statistical feature selection frameworks, particularly through pathway-informed methods that prioritize biologically plausible features while maintaining mathematical rigor.

Neuro-symbolic methods, such as log-linear neural embeddings, achieve scalable feature selection by combining the efficiency of neural networks with symbolic reasoning capabilities [1]. These techniques maintain comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computational overhead, making them particularly suitable for large-scale genomic and clinical datasets [1]. The resulting embeddings facilitate efficient similarity computations and link predictions in biological networks, enabling discovery of latent feature relationships that inform disease mechanisms.\n\nDeep learning architectures further extend feature selection capabilities through automated representation learning.
