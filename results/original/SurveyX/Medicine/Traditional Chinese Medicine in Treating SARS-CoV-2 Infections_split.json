      "level": 1,
      "content": "The integration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) into modern healthcare and research frameworks faces significant methodological and educational challenges that hinder its widespread adoption and optimization. Methodologically, computational approaches for validating TCM practices, such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and augmented reality (AR), exhibit limitations in scalability and comprehensiveness. While GNNs effectively quantify herb-herb interactions in TCM knowledge graphs (TCM-MKG), their performance is constrained by the complexity of multi-component formulations and the need for high-quality, standardized datasets [1]. This complexity is compounded by the inherent variability in herbal compositions and the lack of universally accepted protocols for data collection and analysis. Similarly, AR platforms for TCM education currently encompass only 88 herb types, limiting their utility in providing a holistic understanding of TCM’s extensive pharmacopeia [5]. The restricted scope of these platforms not only undermines the educational experience for practitioners but also perpetuates gaps in knowledge regarding the full range of TCM practices.\n\nEducational barriers further compound these methodological challenges. Existing TCM training programs often lack standardized curricula that integrate modern computational tools with classical TCM theory. The prescription generation method proposed by [3], while innovative, struggles to capture the nuanced relationships between symptoms and disease contexts, reflecting a broader gap in translating empirical TCM knowledge into structured educational frameworks. This limitation is exacerbated by the absence of interdisciplinary training that bridges TCM principles with contemporary biomedical sciences, hindering the development of practitioners proficient in both traditional and modern methodologies. The need for a curriculum that encompasses both the philosophical underpinnings of TCM and the technical aspects of modern medical science is paramount for fostering a new generation of practitioners who can navigate both worlds effectively.\n\nThe generalized unscented transformation (GenUT) probability model, though useful for analyzing TCM compound interactions, exemplifies another methodological constraint: its inability to fully capture off-diagonal elements of skewness and kurtosis may lead to inaccuracies in predicting herb compatibility and pharmacokinetic profiles [9]. Such technical limitations underscore the need for advanced statistical models that can accommodate the multidimensional nature of TCM formulations. Furthermore, the development of robust analytical frameworks that can integrate qualitative and quantitative data from TCM practices is essential for enhancing the credibility and applicability of TCM in modern healthcare settings. Addressing these methodological and educational challenges will be crucial for laying the groundwork for a more integrated approach to healthcare that values both traditional and modern medical practices.\n\nFuture efforts must prioritize the development of comprehensive, technology-enhanced TCM education platforms that address these gaps. Collaborative initiatives involving domain experts, as emphasized by [2], will be critical for refining computational tools and ensuring their alignment with TCM’s theoretical foundations. Additionally, longitudinal studies evaluating the clinical translatability of in silico findings, such as those on fortunellin’s antiviral mechanisms [8], are essential for establishing evidence-based guidelines that bridge methodological innovations with practical applications. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and investing in educational reform, we can create a more conducive environment for integrating TCM into modern healthcare systems, ultimately enhancing patient care and health outcomes."

      "level": 1,
      "content": "The integration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with modern medical practices presents both significant challenges and transformative opportunities for global healthcare systems. A primary obstacle lies in the methodological divergence between TCM’s holistic, syndrome-based approach and modern medicine’s reductionist, biomarker-driven paradigm. This divergence creates a fundamental disconnect that complicates the synthesis of knowledge from both fields. The generalized unscented transformation (GenUT) probability model illustrates a significant challenge in the analysis of TCM, as its current limitations in accurately capturing off-diagonal elements of higher-order moments restrict the comprehensive understanding of the intricate herb-herb interactions within TCM. Despite its ability to utilize $2 n + 1$ sigma points for better representation of skewness and kurtosis, the GenUT still struggles with non-Gaussian distributions and substantial nonlinearities, which are critical for modeling the complex multi-component interactions of herbal formulas. This limitation hinders the effective quantification of compatibility mechanisms essential for advancing TCM theory and enhancing herbal prescription generation [1, 9, 5, 2, 3]. The necessity for advanced statistical frameworks capable of reconciling the complexities of TCM with modern pharmacological evaluation standards cannot be overstated.\n\nEducational disparities further complicate integration efforts. The vast variety and morphological similarity of TCM herbs pose substantial barriers to standardized training, as evidenced by the limited scope of current augmented reality (AR) educational platforms that encompass only 88 herb types [5]. This constraint reflects a broader need for interdisciplinary curricula that equip practitioners with both classical TCM knowledge and contemporary biomedical competencies. The development of intelligent educational tools, such as AI-powered herb identification systems and virtual reality meridian visualization platforms, could bridge this divide by preserving TCM’s empirical wisdom while enhancing its accessibility to modern healthcare professionals. By integrating modern educational technologies with traditional knowledge systems, we can cultivate a new generation of practitioners who are well-versed in both domains, thereby facilitating a more seamless integration of TCM into mainstream healthcare.\n\nDespite these challenges, emerging technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for synergistic integration. Graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to TCM knowledge graphs (TCM-MKG)\n\ndemonstrate how computational methods can decode ancient herbal compatibility principles into quantifiable metrics, enabling evidence-based validation of multi-herb formulations [1]. The application of GenUT models to epidemiological data could facilitate the prediction of TCM’s populationlevel health impacts, potentially informing public health strategies for viral infection management. Such advancements not only enhance the scientific rigor of TCM practices but also pave the way for a more comprehensive understanding of their therapeutic potential within modern healthcare frameworks.\n\nClinical integration models show particular promise in personalized medicine, where TCM’s constitutional typing complements genomic profiling to guide precision interventions. The intelligent optimization framework implemented in Zhejiang province’s community-based prevention programs exemplifies this potential, successfully harmonizing TCM’s individualized approach with modern public health infrastructure [4]. Future research should prioritize hybrid trial designs that evaluate integrative treatment protocols, alongside the development of shared terminologies and outcome measures that enable meaningful dialogue between TCM and modern medical paradigms. By fostering collaboration and dialogue between these two distinct yet complementary systems, we can create a more holistic healthcare landscape that leverages the strengths of both TCM and modern medicine for the benefit of patients worldwide."
