Aligning agricultural practices with environmental sustainability goals mitigates pollution and enhances the economic viability of farming operations.

# 4.2 Challenges in Evidence Translation

Translating synthesized environmental evidence into actionable policies and management decisions faces systemic barriers, including disciplinary silos, stakeholder resistance, and mismatched temporal scales. Communication gaps between researchers and decision-makers often stem from divergent professional lexicons and reward structures, where academic incentives prioritize novel findings over practical applicability [1]. These disconnects manifest in difficulties translating meta-analytic effect sizes into concrete management thresholds or policy indicators [1]. Enhanced dialogue and collaboration between the scientific community and policymakers are needed to foster a shared understanding of evidence relevance.

Stakeholder resistance presents another challenge, particularly when synthesized evidence contradicts established practices or economic interests. In fisheries management, meta-analytic conclusions about optimal harvest rates often encounter pushback from industry groups citing localized exceptions or short-term economic impacts [1]. Similar resistance patterns emerge in agricultural policy, where synthesized evidence on sustainable practices confronts entrenched farming traditions and supply chain dynamics [1]. Addressing these resistance points requires robust communication strategies and trust-building mechanisms that engage stakeholders in the evidence synthesis process.

Temporal and spatial scale mismatches further complicate evidence translation, as ecological processes often operate on longer timescales than political or economic decision cycles. Synthesized climate change adaptation research frequently struggles to influence near-term infrastructure investments despite robust long-term projections [1]. Similarly, meta-analyses of conservation interventions may provide landscape-scale recommendations while management decisions remain constrained by jurisdictional boundaries [1]. Bridging these gaps necessitates innovative policy design approaches that account for ecological timelines and governance structures.

Institutional inertia and risk aversion amplify these translation challenges, particularly in governmental agencies where evidentiary standards for policy changes may exceed scientific conventions. The precautionary principle sometimes becomes a barrier rather than a facilitator when decision-makers perceive synthesized evidence as insufficiently certain for action [1]. These dynamics underscore the need for improved knowledge brokering mechanisms and coproduction frameworks that bridge the evidence-policy divide in environmental governance [1]. Developing institutional capacities that prioritize adaptive management and iterative learning can significantly enhance the efficacy of evidence translation efforts.

# 4.3 Opportunities for Enhanced Integration
