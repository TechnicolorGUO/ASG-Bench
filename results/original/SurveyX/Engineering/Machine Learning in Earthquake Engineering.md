However, challenges persist that impede extensive ML utilization in this sector, notably data scarcity in regions of low seismic activity which hampers model reliability. Moreover, model interpretability remains complex, posing difficulties as decision-making insights are crucial for stakeholder acceptance, and real-time application computational demands further restrict deploying advanced algorithms in critical situations. In response, novel approaches such as synthetic dataset creation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged to enhance data variety and support distributed model training without centralized data consolidation.

Anticipating future advancements, interdisciplinary collaboration will be vital in bridging ML technologies with earthquake engineering principles. Trends indicate integration of digital twin technology for predictive maintenance, potentially optimizing infrastructure management and monitoring. Development of quantum-accelerated hybrid models is expected to transform processing capabilities in complex seismic situations, offering high computational power for intricate challenges. Federated learning architectures present promising opportunities for scalable, privacy-conscious structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. Continued innovation in texture preservation, explainable AI (XAI), and multi-modal data integration will be essential for fully harnessing ML’s potential for seismic resilience enhancement. These developments aim to fortify infrastructure against subsequent earthquakes, significantly contributing to urban safety and sustainability.
