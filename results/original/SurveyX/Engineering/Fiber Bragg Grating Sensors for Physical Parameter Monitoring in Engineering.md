# 2 Background and Core Concepts

# 2.1 Principles of Fiber Bragg Grating Operation

Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors function by modulating the refractive index within an optical fiber core, allowing selective reflection of light at the Bragg wavelength $\lambda _ { B }$ . This principle grants FBG sensors high sensitivity to parameters like strain and temperature, making them valuable in environments with electromagnetic interference. The Bragg condition, which correlates resonant wavelength shifts with measured parameters, facilitates precise assessments in applications such as structural health monitoring [4, 3, 5, 1, 6]. The Bragg wavelength is determined by the grating period $\Lambda$ and the effective refractive index $n _ { e f f }$ , given by:

$$
\lambda _ { B } = 2 n _ { e f f } \Lambda
$$

FBGs are crucial for distributed fiber-optic sensing and high-performance temperature monitoring, such as in future accelerator magnets [7, 5, 7, 8]. The proposed study aims to enhance quench detection in high-energy physics accelerator magnets, integrating high-temperature superconducting coils into hybrid designs. Fiber optic sensors are proposed for real-time monitoring of magnet strain and temperature, with discrete sensors expected to stabilize within 3-5 years and distributed fibers needing further development for enhanced sample rate and sensitivity. Collaboration with manufacturers is vital for improving fiber properties, aiming to instrument numerous superconducting magnets with a funding range of 5 − 10millionoverthenextdecade[9, 10, 5, 8].

The reflection spectrum of FBG sensors results from constructive interference at refractive index discontinuities, with peak reflectivity influenced by coupling coefficient $\kappa$ and grating length $L$ . External perturbations like strain or temperature shifts the Bragg wavelength due to changes in grating period and refractive index. This shift, typically linear with applied strain or temperature, enables precise measurements. Optical dispersion can affect sensitivity, impacting accuracy in applications such as biosensing [6, 5, 5, 3]. The shift $\Delta \lambda _ { B }$ is expressed as:

$$
\Delta \lambda _ { B } = \frac { \partial \lambda _ { B } } { \partial \epsilon } \cdot \epsilon + \frac { \partial \lambda _ { B } } { \partial T } \cdot \Delta T
$$

Advanced signal processing techniques, like FastICA, decouple multi-axial forces [11], and Cosserat rod theory models estimate forces through curvature measurements from FBG arrays [12]. Emerging methods such as Correlation Optical Time-Domain Reflectometry achieve picosecond-level resolution for distributed measurements [10]. Compensation techniques, including chirped grating designs, address non-uniform strain fields, while topological engineering of optical modes enhances sensitivity through phase manipulation [6]. Developments in compressible fluid sensors leverage refractive index variations for hydrodynamic monitoring [13].

# 2.2 Physics of Strain and Temperature Sensing

FBG sensors detect strain and temperature through the linear relationship between Bragg wavelength shift $\Delta \lambda _ { B }$ and mechanical or thermal changes. The photoelastic effect causes refractive index changes under stress, shifting the reflected spectra’s peak wavelength [2, 3, 6, 5, 5]. The equation for the Bragg wavelength change due to strain is:

$$
\frac { \Delta \lambda _ { B } } { \lambda _ { B } } = ( 1 - p _ { e } ) \epsilon + ( \alpha + \zeta ) \Delta T
$$

Here, $p _ { e }$ is the effective volume fraction, $\epsilon$ is strain, $\alpha$ and $\zeta$ are temperature response coefficients, and $\Delta T$ is the temperature change. This relationship is vital for diagnostics in high-energy physics applications, such as monitoring superconducting magnets [12, 5, 7, 8]. Temperature sensitivity arises from thermal expansion $( \alpha )$ and the thermo-optic effect $( \zeta )$ , crucial for sensors like multicore fiber thermometers optimized for industrial applications [13, 5]. The temperature-induced wavelength change is given by:

$$
\frac { \Delta \lambda _ { B } } { \lambda _ { B } } = ( \alpha + \zeta ) \Delta T
$$

Recent advancements enhance sensitivity through hybrid configurations, such as photonic crystal fibers utilizing air-hole microstructures [3]. Techniques measure silica fiber viscosity at high temperatures for sensor reliability [5]. In surgical environments, FBG arrays enable uncertainty-aware shape estimation through strain measurements [14].
