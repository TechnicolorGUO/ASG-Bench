# 3.1 Interactions with Biological Tissues and Fluids

PDMS interacts with biological systems through its surface chemistry, mechanical properties, and environmental conditions. Its hydrophobicity (water contact angle $\sim 1 1 0 ^ { \circ }$ ) promotes non-specific protein adsorption via hydrophobic interactions with proteins like albumin and fibrinogen [1]. This protein layer influences cellular responses, affecting platelet adhesion, immune activation, and tissue integration. The elastic modulus of PDMS $( 0 . 5 7 { - } 3 . 7 \ \mathrm { M P a } )$ reduces mechanical mismatch at tissue interfaces, minimizing foreign body reactions compared to stiffer materials. PDMS’s chemical stability and gas permeability support nutrient exchange and sterility in long-term applications like implants or organ-on-chip systems [2]. However, its hydrophobic surface may cause protein conformational changes, exposing epitopes that trigger immune responses. Surface modifications, such as plasma treatment and chemical functionalization, introduce hydrophilic or bioactive coatings to enhance biocompatibility. PDMS-tissue interactions vary by anatomical location, with fibrous encapsulation in subcutaneous implants and more integrated responses in vascular applications. Its low surface energy $\mathrm { ( \sim 2 0 ~ m N / m ) }$ affects cell adhesion, requiring activation for optimal integration in tissue scaffolds. Molecular fingerprinting techniques reveal nanoscale interfacial interactions, showing how PDMS topography influences biological nanoparticle adhesion and cellular responses [2]. PDMS’s tunable optical properties allow real-time monitoring of biological interactions without compromising mechanical flexibility [1]. While generally hemocompatible, surface modifications are crucial for blood-contacting applications to prevent thrombus formation and ensure device functionality.

However, unmodified PDMS surfaces can affect cell morphology and proliferation, especially in anchorage-dependent cells, highlighting the importance of surface properties. PDMS implants elicit a typical foreign body response, starting with protein adsorption and progressing to macrophage adhesion and fusion into giant cells. PDMS induces lower inflammatory cytokine production than polyurethane or polyethylene, with macrophage activation similar to medical-grade silicone [2]. Its mechanical properties modulate immune responses, with stiffnessmatched formulations reducing fibrous encapsulation. Molecular fingerprinting shows that PDMS surface nanostructuring can reduce pro-inflammatory signaling [2]. PDMS’s gas permeability helps maintain physiological oxygen levels at implant interfaces, preventing hypoxia-induced inflammation. Long-term studies show stable fibrotic capsule thickness and minimal chronic inflammation. Innovations in PDMS nanocomposites enhance immunomodulatory capabilities by incorporating bioactive molecules or nanostructured surfaces to suppress inflammation [1]. PDMS’s dielectric properties $( \varepsilon _ { r } \approx 2 . 3 - 2 . 8 )$ ) enable real-time monitoring of immune responses, essential for developing PDMS-based solutions balancing biocompatibility and functionality.

# 9.1 Plasma Treatment for Surface Activation

Plasma treatment is essential for activating PDMS surfaces, converting hydrophobic surfaces (contact angle $\sim 1 1 0 ^ { \circ }$ ) to hydrophilic ones [1]. Low-pressure oxygen plasma generates reactive species that oxidize surface methyl groups, creating silanol $( S i O H )$ functionalities, reducing contact angles to $2 0 ^ { \circ } - 4 0 ^ { \circ }$ . This increases surface energy from $\sim 2 0 \mathrm { m N } / \mathrm { m }$ to over $7 0 \mathrm { m N } / \mathrm { m }$ , facilitating covalent bonding through silanol condensation [1]. Activation involves methyl group abstraction, silica-like layer formation, and nanometer-scale roughness generation. Hydrophobic recovery occurs due to siloxane diffusion but can be mitigated by immediate post-treatment modification [2].

Advanced plasma techniques use gases like ammonia for amine introduction and argon-oxygen for nanotexturing. Incorporating silicon nanostructures enhances stability and transparency [1]. Plasmaactivated surfaces show distinct protein adsorption patterns, favoring cell-adhesive proteins [2]. PDMS’s dielectric properties influence plasma penetration and modification uniformity, crucial for microfluidic device fabrication. Innovations like atmospheric-pressure plasma jets enable localized activation without vacuum systems, expanding plasma treatment applications [1].

# 9.2 Chemical Coatings for Functionalization

Chemical coatings offer precise PDMS surface functionalization for biomedical applications. Silane chemistry, using organosilanes like APTES, forms covalent bonds with plasma-activated surfaces, introducing amine groups for biomolecule conjugation [1]. This involves alkoxy group hydrolysis and silanol condensation, facilitating biomolecule immobilization through carbodiimide chemistry.

PEG coatings reduce nonspecific adsorption, forming brush-like structures that decrease protein adsorption by up to $90 \%$ [2]. Silicon nanostructures enhance coating uniformity and stability [1]. Hydrogel coatings combine PDMS’s mechanical properties with polymer hydrophilicity, improving cell compatibility [1]. Bioactive coatings with ECM proteins promote cell adhesion, while conductive polymer coatings integrate electronic functionality [1].

# 9.3 Physical Modifications and Nanostructuring

Physical modification techniques alter PDMS surface topography and mechanical properties. Mechanical abrasion creates microscale roughness for enhanced adhesion [1]. Soft lithography achieves precise patterning, influencing cellular responses and fluidic behavior [1]. Nanostructuring with silicon enhances optical and biological properties [1]. Laser ablation provides direct-write patterning, facilitating microfluidic design [2, 1].

Microcontact printing creates spatially controlled bioactive regions, while breath figure templating produces porous surfaces [1]. Emerging techniques combine physical and chemical approaches for hierarchical structures, leveraging PDMS’s properties for stable surface features [1].

# 9.4 Comparative Analysis of Modification Techniques

PDMS surface modification techniques vary in mechanisms and effectiveness. Plasma treatment offers rapid activation but suffers from hydrophobic recovery [1]. Chemical coatings like PEG provide stable hydrophilicity but require multi-step processes [2]. Physical techniques like soft lithography create permanent features but may affect transparency [1]. Nanostructured surfaces enhance adsorption patterns, maintaining flexibility [2]. Supported lipid bilayers offer biomimetic interfaces but require precise conditions [2].

Plasma treatment enables uniform modification, while microcontact printing offers precise patterning. Chemical vapor deposition achieves monolayer control but may involve hazardous precursors [1]. PDMS’s dielectric properties influence electrically assisted modifications, with conductive coatings showing enhanced stability on plasma-activated surfaces [1].

Covalent modifications outperform physical adsorption in durability, though physical methods like laser ablation offer rapid prototyping. PDMS’s gas permeability affects modification techniques, as some processes may penetrate beyond intended layers [1]. Hybrid approaches combine strengths of multiple techniques, providing tailored solutions for biomedical interfaces, biosensing, and nanoparticle characterization [2, 1]. Optimal strategy selection depends on application requirements for stability, precision, and functionality.
