Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a behavior characterized by deliberate harm to one’s own body without the intention of suicide. It has emerged as a significant concern in public health due to its increasing prevalence and the profound implications it has for mental health. The phenomenon encompasses a range of behaviors, including cutting, burning, and hitting oneself, which often serve as coping mechanisms for emotional distress. Understanding NSSI is crucial, as it frequently co-occurs with various psychological disorders, complicating treatment and leading to adverse outcomes. This review aims to synthesize the current literature on the prevalence, clinical significance, and underlying mechanisms of NSSI, thereby providing insights into effective intervention strategies.

# 1.1 Prevalence and Clinical Significance of NSSI

Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) represents a significant public health concern, with epidemiological studies indicating its high prevalence across diverse populations. Among adolescents, lifetime prevalence rates range from $17 \%$ to $18 \%$ in community samples, with higher rates observed in clinical populations [1]. This behavior exhibits notable demographic variations, with higher incidence reported among females and individuals identifying as sexual minorities, suggesting that social and cultural factors may influence its expression. The clinical implications of NSSI extend beyond immediate physical harm, as it frequently co-occurs with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and borderline personality disorder, often serving as a marker for severe psychopathology. This multifaceted nature of NSSI necessitates a comprehensive understanding of its clinical significance, as it can be indicative of deeper psychological distress and dysfunction.

The developmental trajectory of NSSI typically emerges during early adolescence, with peak incidence occurring between ages 12 and 15. This critical period of vulnerability coincides with significant neurodevelopmental and psychosocial maturation, which may contribute to the emergence of self-injurious behaviors [1]. Longitudinal studies demonstrate that while many individuals cease NSSI behaviors by young adulthood, a subset develops chronic patterns, with increased risk for subsequent suicidal ideation and attempts. Consequently, this temporal persistence highlights the need for early identification and intervention, particularly given the potential for neurobiological alterations associated with prolonged engagement in self-injurious behaviors. Recognizing these patterns can facilitate timely therapeutic approaches that address underlying psychological issues.

From a clinical standpoint, NSSI serves multiple functions, including emotion regulation, selfpunishment, and interpersonal communication, which complicate treatment approaches. The behavior’s association with impaired quality of life, social dysfunction, and increased healthcare utilization underscores its substantial economic burden on mental health systems. Emerging research suggests that early biomarkers of stress system dysregulation, such as those identified in prenatal stress studies [1], may inform preventive strategies for at-risk populations. By bridging the gap between neurobiological risk factors and clinical manifestations, these findings underscore the importance of a proactive approach in addressing NSSI. Understanding the complex interplay between various factors contributing to NSSI can aid clinicians in developing more effective treatment and prevention strategies.

# 1.2 Structure of the Survey

This survey systematically examines the biological mechanisms and temporal dynamics of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) through an integrative framework that bridges neurobiological, psychological, and clinical perspectives. The paper begins with an introduction to NSSI’s prevalence and clinical significance, establishing its public health impact and developmental trajectory [1]. In Section 2, foundational definitions and key concepts are provided, delineating NSSI from other self-harm behaviors and introducing critical neurobiological systems implicated in its etiology. This section lays the groundwork for understanding the complexities of NSSI by contextualizing it within existing literature and establishing clear definitions.

Section 3 delves into the neurobiological underpinnings of NSSI, focusing on neurotransmitter dysregulation, including the roles of opioid, serotonin, and dopamine systems. This exploration extends to structural-functional disruptions in prefrontal-limbic circuits, which are vital for emotional regulation and decision-making processes. Section 4 examines the temporal dynamics of stress responses, specifically investigating how both acute and chronic stress reactions are regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. It further explores the intricate interplay between these stress responses and psychological trauma, highlighting physiological mechanisms involved, including cortisol secretion patterns and their implications for neurodevelopmental outcomes. This section emphasizes the potential for early intervention strategies informed by non-invasive biomarkers, which could significantly alter the trajectory of individuals at risk for NSSI [2, 3, 4, 1].

The survey culminates in Section 6 with a synthesis of neurobiological and psychological models, proposing comprehensive frameworks to explain NSSI’s cyclical nature. This synthesis draws on findings from previous sections to illustrate how biological, psychological, and social factors interact in the perpetuation of NSSI behaviors. Finally, Section 7 identifies gaps in current research, emphasizing the need for longitudinal neuroimaging studies and targeted interventions informed by temporal biomarkers [1]. This structured approach reflects a deliberate progression from molecular mechanisms to systemic interactions, aligning with contemporary multidisciplinary approaches to understanding NSSI and providing a roadmap for future research endeavors.The following sections are organized as shown in Figure 1.

# 2 Background and Definitions

# 2.1 Definition and Scope of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI)

Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is defined as the intentional, self-inflicted damage to body tissue without suicidal intent, serving purposes not socially sanctioned [1]. This behavior includes methods such as cutting, burning, and scratching, often used to modulate emotional states or facilitate interpersonal communication. NSSI is differentiated from suicidal behavior by the absence of lethal intent, although there is clinical overlap in individuals with comorbid psychopathology. Understanding NSSI is vital as it reflects individual distress and highlights societal issues regarding mental health and coping mechanisms.

NSSI’s diagnostic criteria exclude culturally normative practices and behaviors secondary to psychotic or developmental disorders. Current perspectives emphasize its role as a maladaptive coping mechanism, particularly in response to stress system dysregulation [1]. This aligns with neurobiological findings linking NSSI to altered pain processing and opioid dynamics, distinguishing it from other self-harm behaviors. A comprehensive understanding of NSSI must consider individual psychological factors and societal influences, such as stigma and mental health resource access.

Epidemiological research indicates that NSSI typically begins in early adolescence, a period of heightened neuroplasticity and stress sensitivity. Its persistence in clinical populations suggests neuroadaptive changes reinforcing its cyclical nature, classifying it as a distinct clinical phenomenon. Emerging studies on prenatal stress biomarkers [1] highlight the need for precise nosological definitions, as early-life stress exposures may predispose individuals to specific NSSI phenotypes through epigenetic mechanisms. This evolving understanding informs clinical practice and underscores the importance of early intervention strategies addressing underlying factors contributing to NSSI.

The multifaceted nature of NSSI requires an integrative approach combining psychological, biological, and social perspectives. Recognizing diverse motivations behind self-injury enables the development of targeted interventions to meet the unique needs of individuals engaging in NSSI, fostering resilience and promoting healthier coping strategies.

# 2.2 Key Psychological and Neurobiological Concepts

The mechanisms underlying NSSI involve complex interactions between stress response systems, neurotransmitter dysregulation, and emotional processing pathways. Central to these mechanisms is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, mediating stress responses. Dysregulation of the HPA axis, evident in altered cortisol secretion patterns, is observed in individuals with NSSI, suggesting maladaptive adaptation to prolonged stress [1]. This dysregulation often coexists with heightened emotional reactivity and impaired recovery from negative states, providing a neurobiological basis for NSSI as a coping strategy. Understanding HPA axis functioning can inform therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring stress response balance.

Neurotransmitter systems, particularly the endogenous opioid, serotonin, and dopamine systems, are pivotal in NSSI pathophysiology. The endogenous opioid system modulates pain perception and affective states, with evidence indicating that NSSI may temporarily restore opioidergic balance, offering short-term emotional relief [1]. Serotonergic dysfunction, linked to impulsivity and mood dysregulation, increases vulnerability to NSSI, while dopaminergic pathways reinforce selfinjurious behaviors through altered reward processing. The interplay between these systems underscores NSSI’s complexity, as individuals may self-injure to regulate dysregulated emotional states.

At the neural circuit level, disruptions in prefrontal-limbic connectivity impair emotional regulation and impulse control. Neuroimaging studies show reduced prefrontal cortex activity and heightened amygdala reactivity during emotional tasks in individuals with NSSI, reflecting a failure to inhibit limbic-driven responses. These findings align with psychological models emphasizing emotion regulation deficits as central to NSSI. The interaction between psychological trauma and neurobiological adaptations complicates this landscape, as early-life stress induces lasting changes in stress sensitivity and neurotransmitter function, perpetuating self-injury. Integrating neurobiological perspectives into therapeutic frameworks is crucial for addressing both emotional and physiological aspects of NSSI.

Emerging research on prenatal stress biomarkers suggests potential for early interventions targeting neurobiological vulnerabilities [1]. Identifying at-risk individuals and implementing preventive measures can significantly reduce NSSI prevalence, aiming to mitigate self-injury’s immediate effects and foster long-term emotional resilience. Ongoing research is essential to refine our understanding of the intricate relationship between psychological and neurobiological factors in NSSI, informing more effective treatment strategies.

# 3 Neurobiological Mechanisms of NSSI

Exploring the neurobiological mechanisms of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) necessitates examining neurotransmitter system interactions and their impact on emotional regulation and behavior. Understanding these neurotransmitter roles is crucial for grasping the pathophysiological processes contributing to NSSI. As illustrated in Figure 2, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying NSSI are categorized into three key components: neurotransmitter dysregulation, prefrontal-limbic circuit disruptions, and neurophysiological mechanisms of emotional processing. Each of these categories is further subdivided into specific systems and abnormalities, emphasizing their roles in emotional regulation and the maladaptive coping strategies associated with NSSI. The following subsection focuses on neurotransmitter dysregulations, elucidating how these alterations shape the neurobiological landscape of NSSI. This exploration aids in identifying therapeutic intervention avenues by integrating findings from diverse studies to appreciate NSSI’s complexity, encompassing biological and psychological dimensions.

# 3.1 Neurotransmitter Dysregulation in NSSI

Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) involves complex neurotransmitter dysregulation, notably in the endogenous opioid, serotonin, and dopamine systems. The endogenous opioid system, central to NSSI pathophysiology, mediates pain and affective states, with NSSI potentially restoring opioidergic balance, offering temporary relief from distress [1]. This aligns with clinical observations of reduced pain sensitivity post-self-injury, reinforcing NSSI as a maladaptive coping strategy. Addressing the immediate relief and underlying distress driving NSSI is crucial for intervention development.

As illustrated in Figure 3, the hierarchical structure of neurotransmitter dysregulation in NSSI emphasizes the interconnected roles of the endogenous opioid system, serotonergic dysfunction, and dopaminergic pathways. Each category highlights key aspects such as pain mediation, mood dysregulation, and reward processing that contribute to NSSI behaviors. Serotonergic dysfunction significantly influences NSSI vulnerability through impulsivity and mood dysregulation. Reduced serotonin availability, evidenced by diminished cerebrospinal fluid 5-HIAA levels, correlates with impaired control and heightened emotional reactivity. Genetic polymorphisms in serotonin transporter genes, interacting with early-life stress, exacerbate NSSI risk [1]. Understanding these interactions facilitates targeted strategies for restoring serotonergic balance and enhancing emotional regulation.

Dopaminergic pathways impact NSSI through reward processing and habit formation. Altered striatal dopamine receptor density suggests reinforcement mechanisms, where self-injury becomes habitual, especially during adolescence [1]. Dopaminergic signaling integrates with opioidergic and serotonergic systems, forming a neurobiological framework where NSSI modulates dysphoric states and establishes addictive patterns. Epigenetic biomarkers offer early identification of neurotransmitter dysregulations, highlighting preventive intervention targets [1]. A comprehensive understanding of NSSI incorporates neurobiology and epigenetics, opening avenues for early detection and intervention.

Figure 2: This figure illustrates the neurobiological mechanisms underlying nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), categorizing the key components into neurotransmitter dysregulation, prefrontal-limbic circuit disruptions, and neurophysiological mechanisms of emotional processing. Each category is further divided into specific systems and abnormalities, highlighting their roles in emotional regulation and maladaptive coping strategies associated with NSSI.

Neurotransmitter dysregulation in NSSI reveals neuroadaptive phases, from stress-induced alterations to chronic imbalances. Acute stress responses involve rapid opioid and dopamine fluctuations, leading to immediate changes, while chronic NSSI engagement results in sustained neurochemical imbalances, reinforcing behavior over time [2, 1]. Stress exposure disrupts the HPA axis and ANS, contributing to neurodevelopmental issues and increasing neuropsychiatric disorder susceptibility. Understanding neurochemical dynamics is vital for effective early intervention programs, promoting healthier emotional regulation. Early intervention strategies targeting neurotransmitter homeostasis are crucial, particularly for populations with genetic or epigenetic risk factors. Future research should focus on longitudinal assessments of neurotransmitter dynamics across developmental stages, integrating physiological signals with behavioral phenotypes to refine predictive models of NSSI trajectory.

Figure 3: This figure illustrates the hierarchical structure of neurotransmitter dysregulation in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), focusing on the endogenous opioid system, serotonergic dysfunction, and dopaminergic pathways. Each category highlights key aspects such as pain mediation, mood dysregulation, and reward processing that contribute to NSSI behaviors.

# 3.2 Prefrontal-Limbic Circuit Disruptions

Neuroimaging consistently identifies structural and functional abnormalities in prefrontal-limbic circuits in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), crucial for emotion regulation and impulse control. Reduced gray matter in the dlPFC and ACC suggests impaired top-down regulation over limbic-driven responses [1]. Structural deficits correlate with functional connectivity disruptions, particularly diminished PFC-amygdala coupling during emotional tasks, reinforcing the cycle of self-injury.

Functional MRI reveals heightened amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli in NSSI populations, with hypoactivation of regulatory regions like vlPFC and OFC. This neural imbalance results in increased emotional reactivity and prolonged distress recovery, forming a neurobiological substrate for NSSI as a maladaptive coping mechanism [1]. Prefrontal-limbic dysconnectivity severity predicts self-injurious behavior frequency and chronicity, highlighting its role in maintaining the NSSI cycle. Targeted interventions addressing neural disruptions could improve emotional regulation and reduce NSSI incidence.

Temporal dynamics reveal early-life stress exacerbates prefrontal-limbic development trajectories. Adolescents engaging in NSSI experience accelerated amygdala maturation and delayed PFC development, creating vulnerability where heightened limbic activity overpowers PFC regulation, increasing emotional dysregulation risk [1, 3, 4, 2]. Psychological trauma alters synaptic pruning and myelination patterns in prefrontal-limbic pathways, emphasizing the need for early intervention strategies to mitigate neuropsychiatric disorders.

DTI data indicate microstructural abnormalities in white matter tracts connecting PFC and limbic structures, highlighting reduced fractional anisotropy in pathways like the uncinate fasciculus and cingulum bundle [2, 3, 4]. These findings suggest impaired information transfer between cognitive control and emotional processing networks, underlying inflexible coping styles in NSSI. Multimodal neuroimaging and behavioral measures indicate prefrontal-limbic disruptions as a converging pathway for risk factors, including genetic predispositions, early adversity, and neurotransmitter dysregulation, increasing NSSI susceptibility.

Future research should focus on dynamic network analyses capturing real-time prefrontal-limbic interactions during emotion regulation tasks and neurofeedback interventions targeting circuit dysfunctions. Identifying sensitive periods for prefrontal-limbic development could inform precision prevention strategies, particularly for high-risk youth with emerging stress system dysregulation [1]. This approach could enhance early interventions, fostering resilience and healthier coping mechanisms.

# 3.3 Neurophysiological Mechanisms of Emotional Processing

Neurophysiological mechanisms in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) involve alterations in neural oscillatory activity and event-related potentials, reflecting impaired affective regulation at the electrophysiological level. EEG studies using advanced techniques like LVPCA [3] reveal aberrant cortical activation patterns during emotional tasks in NSSI individuals. Reduced alpha-band synchronization over frontal regions indicates diminished inhibitory control over limbic responses, while heightened theta-band power in parietal-occipital areas suggests sustained vigilance toward negative stimuli. Understanding these patterns is crucial for grasping how NSSI individuals process emotional information differently, leading to maladaptive responses.

Time-frequency analyses identify gamma-band activity disruptions during early emotional processing stages, reflecting impaired sensory gating and heightened reactivity. LVPCA [3] decomposes EEG signals, revealing delayed P300 latencies and reduced LPP amplitudes in NSSI individuals during emotionally salient stimuli processing. These markers correlate with self-reported emotion regulation difficulties, representing a neurophysiological substrate for NSSI’s maladaptive coping strategies. Identifying these markers enhances understanding of emotional dysregulation’s neurophysiological basis, offering intervention avenues.

Temporal dynamics suggest biphasic disturbances in emotional processing: initial hyperarousal followed by deficient regulatory responses. Enhanced early ERP component amplitudes, specifically N1 and P2, suggest increased early attention allocation to emotional stimuli, reflecting underlying neurophysiological processes of emotional dysregulation. Multilevel multivariate functional data analysis illuminates brain activity-emotional response relationships in trauma histories, highlighting

ERP components as biomarkers for emotional processing vulnerabilities [1, 3, 4]. Later components, like N400, show attenuated responses, indicating impaired emotional information-contextual cue integration. This dissociation aligns with neuroimaging evidence of prefrontal-limbic dysconnectivity, forming a comprehensive neurophysiological model of NSSI’s emotional dysregulation.

Emerging research suggests neurophysiological markers as objective treatment response measures, with preliminary evidence indicating EEG pattern normalization post-intervention. Interpretable dimensionality reduction techniques [3] refine biomarkers by identifying electrophysiological subtypes within NSSI populations, enabling personalized therapeutic approaches. Future research should integrate multimodal neurophysiological assessments with real-time behavioral monitoring to capture neural activity-self-injurious urge dynamics, particularly during emotional distress periods. This integrative approach could enhance NSSI understanding and contribute to more effective, individualized treatment modalities.

# 4 Temporal Dynamics and Stress Response in NSSI

An exploration of temporal dynamics in stress responses related to nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) necessitates a comprehensive examination of neuroendocrine mechanisms, particularly the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a key orchestrator of stress responses. Table 1 offers a detailed comparison of the neurobiological features and intervention strategies associated with the HPA axis and stress responses in the context of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), emphasizing the temporal dynamics and their implications for therapeutic approaches. This section investigates the HPA axis’s role in stress reactivity patterns and its implications for NSSI, aiming to illuminate the physiological processes underlying maladaptive coping strategies. The interactions between stress responses and self-injurious behaviors evolve over time, emphasizing the need for a detailed analysis. By synthesizing insights from multiple studies, this analysis aims to elucidate the multifaceted nature of stress reactivity in the context of NSSI.

# 4.1 The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis and Stress Response

The HPA axis, as the primary neuroendocrine stress mediator, is critical in the context of NSSI pathophysiology. Typically, it regulates adaptive responses via a cascade involving corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol. However, in NSSI, the HPA axis exhibits dysregulation with altered cortisol dynamics reflecting maladaptive stress reactivity [2]. Dysregulated HPA activity not only affects hormonal responses but significantly impacts emotional regulation and NSSI behaviors.

Chronic stress in NSSI corresponds to HPA axis dysfunction, displaying either hyperreactivity or blunted cortisol responsesearly stages are marked by exaggerated responses, whereas prolonged self-injury leads to hypocortisolism indicating axis exhaustion [2]. This biphasic pattern aligns with allostatic load models, where recurring stress responses foster progressive dysregulation. Early identification and intervention are crucial in restoring HPA axis function to enhance emotional resilience.

Prenatal stress (PS) significantly influences HPA axis dysregulation in NSSI, as maternal stress induces epigenetic modifications affecting fetal HPA activity and glucocorticoid feedback systems [4]. These early alterations, compounded by postnatal adversity, increase NSSI risk. The quest for reliable prenatal stress biomarkers is challenged by limited maternal stress awareness [1], signifying the need for improved detection protocols to mitigate NSSI risk.

Temporal analyses reveal significant diurnal rhythm irregularities in HPA axis function among NSSI individuals, with attenuated cortisol awakening responses (CAR) and nocturnal cortisol elevations. Such disturbances are linked to sleep issues and emotional dysregulation, underscoring the interplay between stress reactivity and recovery [2, 3, 4, 1]. Integrating HPA axis data with neuroimaging shows cortisol’s modulatory effect on prefrontal-limbic connectivity, linking endocrine dysfunction with emotion regulation deficits in NSSI.

Future research should focus on longitudinal assessments of HPA axis trajectories, including advanced biomarker discovery for intervention-sensitive periods. Targeted modulation of glucocorticoid signaling promises novel therapies, especially for those with prenatal stress exposures or early HPA axis dysregulation [4]. By developing stress reactivity profiles, interventions can be tailored to individual neuroendocrine phenotypes within NSSI contexts, fostering deeper insights into HPA dynamics.

# 4.2 Acute and Chronic Stress Responses in NSSI

Stress responses in NSSI manifest through distinct neurobiological profiles in acute versus chronic phases, vital for understanding the progression and maintenance of self-injurious behaviors. Acute stress responses trigger rapid HPA activation and transient cortisol spikes conducive to immediate coping mechanisms, yet traditional cortisol assay limitations complicate interpretation [2]. LVPCAbased assessments highlight exaggerated early ERPs to emotional stimuli in acute stress, denoting increased vigilance and impaired regulation [3].

This dynamic is further illustrated in Figure 4, which depicts the hierarchical structure of stress responses in NSSI, categorizing them into acute stress responses, chronic stress adaptations, and transition dynamics. Each category highlights key neurobiological and physiological components, emphasizing the progression and maintenance of self-injurious behaviors.

Chronic stress adaptations in NSSI reveal neuroendocrine and neural dysregulation: HPA axis issues alongside allostatic load foster hypocortisolism, glucocorticoid receptor downregulation, and feedback impairments, seen in recurrent self-injury cases [2]. Cross-species PS comparisons indicate developmental origins of chronic adaptability via epigenetic stress-gene alterations [4]. LVPCA uncovers attenuated cortical emotional responses under chronic stress, suggesting neural habituation to distress.

Transition from acute to chronic stress in NSSI is nonlinear, shaped by timing, frequency, and resilience. Initial acute responses prevail early in NSSI, serving as quick tension reducers, while repeated injuries induce maladaptive plasticity in prefrontal and amygdala circuits, sustaining chronic stress sensitivity. PS model analyses highlight rapid transition vulnerabilities due to early stress exposure [4], emphasizing early intervention to disrupt acute-to-chronic progressions.

Neurophysiological markers from LVPCA analyses elucidate stress response development in NSSI, with acute phases displaying gamma-band oscillations and early ERPs denoting threat hypervigilance, while chronic phases show theta-delta predominance and ERP reduction, indicating emotional blunting and disengagement [2]. These patterns facilitate targeted interventions based on acute and chronic neurobiological alterations associated with stress responses.

The clinical import of these dynamics suggests stage-specific NSSI interventions, with acute stress responses benefiting from quick neurophysiological modulation via real-time biofeedback, while chronic adaptations require HPA recalibration and neural reorganization. Integrating multimodal stress assessments, such as endocrine measures with electrophysiological analyses [3], enables critical transition point identification, enhancing NSSI treatment development aligned to evolving patient needs.

Figure 4: This figure illustrates the hierarchical structure of stress responses in NSSI, categorizing them into acute stress responses, chronic stress adaptations, and transition dynamics. Each category highlights key neurobiological and physiological components, emphasizing the progression and maintenance of self-injurious behaviors.

# 4.3 Temporal Frameworks and Intervention Strategies

Developing effective NSSI interventions hinges on comprehending temporal dynamics, particularly in acute-to-chronic stress progression. Population pharmacokinetic cortisol modeling [2] provides quantitative frameworks to characterize these phases, revealing distinct stress engagement periods aligned with intervention windows. Acute-phase interventions benefit from real-time cortisol monitoring to pinpoint stress reactivity peaks, while chronic phases necessitate long-term HPA normalization and neural circuit reorganization strategies.

NSSI temporal trajectories highlight stage-targeted therapy, with early intervention disrupting acute self-injury reinforcement cycles. Pharmacokinetic cortisol models [2] outline predictable stressexposure patterns, pinpointing optimal pharmacological or behavioral intervention points. Preemptive stress-buffering agent administration during cortisol surges may alleviate acute distress without reinforcing maladaptive habits. Likewise, cognitive-behavioral strategies timed to stress phases can enhance emotional regulation during vulnerable periods.

Chronic NSSI requires interventions addressing dysregulated temporal rhythms across biological systems, with HPA dysfunction [2] suggesting cortisol rhythm stabilization and sleep-wake cycle regularization techniques. Neuroplasticity interventions could leverage neural reorganization critical periods, especially during developmental transitions when stress sensitivity peaks. Multimodal approaches synchronizing pharmacological, behavioral, and neuromodulatory elements with stress responses show promise for tackling chronic NSSI’s complex temporal architecture.

Future NSSI intervention research should prioritize temporal biomarker integration with real-time monitoring technologies. Dynamic stress response systems [2] may support personalized interventions adapting to shifting stress states. Closed-loop intervention systems adjusting parameters via continuous physiological monitoring mark an innovative approach to managing temporal variability in NSSI pathophysiology. Longitudinal efficacy tracking across NSSI temporal phases will validate time-sensitive treatment frameworks, potentially transforming NSSI management and improving therapeutic responsiveness.

# 5 Psychological Trauma and Behavioral Neuroscience in NSSI

The rising prevalence of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) necessitates a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between psychological trauma and its neurobiological underpinnings. Psychological trauma, characterized by emotional responses to distressing events, significantly influences mental health and behavior. NSSI is increasingly recognized as a maladaptive coping mechanism for individuals dealing with intense emotional pain. This section explores how trauma alters neurobiological systems, affecting NSSI risk and manifestation. By examining the integration of trauma and neurobiology, we can elucidate the mechanisms through which adverse experiences foster maladaptive coping strategies. The subsequent subsection will detail the interaction between trauma and neurobiological processes, providing a comprehensive overview of current models that explain this intricate relationship.

# 5.1 Integration of Trauma and Neurobiology in NSSI Models

The interaction between psychological trauma and neurobiological systems is crucial for understanding the etiology and persistence of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). Traumatic experiences, especially during sensitive developmental periods, lead to enduring changes in stress response systems and neural circuitry, creating a neurobiological predisposition to maladaptive coping strategies. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a key mediator, with trauma-induced dysregulation manifesting as hyperreactivity or blunted cortisol responses, contingent on stressor chronicity and developmental timing [2]. These patterns reflect adaptive attempts to maintain homeostasis under chronic stress but paradoxically increase susceptibility to NSSI by impairing emotion regulation. This highlights the complexity of trauma’s impact on neurobiological responses, contributing to self-injurious behaviors as misguided emotional regulation.

Prenatal stress (PS) is a potent early-life influence on neurobiological systems relevant to NSSI, with lasting effects across the lifespan. Research shows that maternal stress during gestation modifies glucocorticoid receptor expression in offspring, leading to persistent HPA axis dysregulation and increased stress sensitivity [4]. These neuroendocrine changes coincide with structural and functional alterations in prefrontal-limbic circuits, predisposing individuals to emotion dysregulation and impulsivity. Identifying noninvasive biomarkers for fetal stress exposure is challenging due to limited maternal awareness [4], underscoring the need for improved detection methods in high-risk populations. Understanding prenatal stress’s long-term implications on neurobiological development is crucial for devising interventions to mitigate NSSI risks.

Advanced neurophysiological techniques, like interpretable principal components analysis (LVPCA) [3], have revealed trauma-related alterations in neural processing contributing to NSSI. EEG studies using LVPCA show cortical hyperreactivity to threat-related stimuli in trauma-exposed individuals with NSSI, characterized by enhanced early event-related potentials (ERPs) and reduced late regulatory components. This suggests a biphasic disturbance in emotional processinginitial hypervigilance followed by deficient cognitive reappraisalmirroring the tension-reduction cycle seen in NSSI behaviors. LVPCA’s ability to decompose complex neural signals into interpretable components [3] has identified trauma-specific electrophysiological signatures, including aberrant gamma-band oscillations in frontal regions correlating with impaired inhibitory control. This underscores the need for therapeutic strategies addressing neurobiological consequences of trauma to reduce NSSI risk.

The temporal dynamics of trauma-neurobiology interactions in NSSI reveal progressive neuroadaptations reinforcing maladaptive coping strategies. Acute trauma responses involve rapid neurotransmitter fluctuations and heightened autonomic arousal, while chronic trauma exposure leads to lasting changes in neural architecture and stress system function. This progression is evident in the shift from initial stress-induced opioid release during NSSI acts to long-term opioidergic dysregulation, creating neurochemical dependency on self-injury for affect modulation. Population pharmacokinetic modeling of cortisol dynamics [2] shows neuroadaptations follow predictable trajectories, offering intervention points to disrupt the trauma-NSSI cycle. Exploring these trajectories is vital for developing interventions targeting neurobiological mechanisms contributing to NSSI, aiming to reduce its prevalence among vulnerable populations.

Future research should focus on integrating multimodal assessments of trauma-related neurobiological changes, combining advanced electrophysiological analyses [3] with precision endocrine profiling [2] to identify distinct biotypes within NSSI populations. Longitudinal studies tracking the developmental interplay between trauma exposure and neural circuit maturation will be essential for pinpointing critical intervention periods. Developing trauma-informed neurobiological models holds promise for personalized treatment approaches targeting specific mechanisms linking psychological trauma to NSSI vulnerability. Advancing our understanding of these interactions can pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies addressing NSSI’s root causes.

# 5.2 Behavioral Neuroscience Perspectives on NSSI

Behavioral neuroscience approaches to nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) focus on reinforcement mechanisms and habit formation processes underlying the development and persistence of self-injurious behaviors. The method for disentangling psychobiological stress reactivity [2] provides a framework for understanding how cortisol dynamics interact with reward processing pathways to reinforce NSSI. Acute stress responses trigger rapid neurochemical changes, including dopamine release in the ventral striatum, initially reinforcing NSSI as a tension-reduction strategy. Over time, these acute reinforcements transition into habitual patterns through neuroplastic adaptations in corticostriatal circuits, creating automatic responses to distress. This shift underscores the need to understand neurobiological shifts facilitating the transition to habitual self-injury.

The transition from goal-directed to habitual NSSI involves shifts in neural control from prefrontal cortical regions to dorsal striatal systems. Population pharmacokinetic modeling of cortisol secretion patterns [2] reveals stress-induced glucocorticoid fluctuations modulate this transition by altering synaptic plasticity in striatal medium spiny neurons. Chronic stress exposure accelerates habit formation through glucocorticoid-mediated changes in dopamine receptor sensitivity, lowering the threshold for NSSI behaviors to become stimulus-bound and resistant to extinction. These neuroadaptations explain the compulsive quality of chronic NSSI, where self-injury persists despite negative consequences or reduced reward. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing interventions to disrupt the habit formation process associated with NSSI.

Behavioral neuroscience models integrate reinforcement processes with opioidergic mechanisms of NSSI, proposing a dual-system framework where both positive (reward-based) and negative (reliefbased) reinforcement maintain the behavior. The endogenous opioid system contributes to negative reinforcement through stress-induced analgesia and affective relief following self-injury, while dopaminergic pathways mediate positive reinforcement via unexpected reward signals during initial NSSI episodes. The temporal dynamics of these systems, characterized by cortisol response curves [2], demonstrate early-stage NSSI is dominated by opioid-mediated relief, while chronic NSSI shows stronger dopaminergic habit signatures. This dual reinforcement model highlights NSSI’s complexity, suggesting interventions must address both immediate relief and long-term habit formation processes.

Neurocomputational approaches to NSSI emphasize maladaptive decision-making processes, where altered reward prediction errors bias behavior toward immediate relief despite long-term costs. Stress-induced changes in corticolimbic connectivity distort value representations in the orbitofrontal cortex, leading to preferential selection of self-injury over alternative coping strategies. These distortions are exacerbated by HPA axis dysregulation [2], impairing prefrontal cortical function during stress exposure and further compromising cognitive control over habitual responses. Understanding decision-making processes is pivotal for designing interventions to recalibrate reward systems and enhance cognitive control in individuals at risk for NSSI.

Future research should focus on developing behavioral neuroscience-informed interventions targeting specific reinforcement mechanisms at different NSSI stages. Real-time cortisol monitoring [2] could identify critical windows for disrupting habit formation, while computational modeling of reinforcement learning parameters may personalize interventions based on individual reward processing profiles. Integrating behavioral neuroscience perspectives with neuroendocrine and neuroimaging data will advance mechanistic understanding of NSSI maintenance and inform novel treatment approaches. Leveraging insights from behavioral neuroscience can lead to more effective strategies to prevent and treat NSSI, ultimately improving outcomes for affected individuals.

# 6 Integration of Neurobiological and Psychological Perspectives

Integrating neurobiological and psychological perspectives is crucial for comprehensively understanding nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). This dual approach illuminates the mechanisms underlying NSSI, emphasizing the interplay between biological and psychological factors. NSSI emerges from a blend of stress, emotional dysregulation, and neurobiological vulnerabilities. By synthesizing insights from both domains, researchers can develop a holistic view of NSSI’s etiology and progression. This section explores comprehensive models of NSSI, synthesizing these perspectives to provide a nuanced framework for understanding the complexities of this behavior.

# 6.1 Comprehensive Models of NSSI

Contemporary models of NSSI underscore the integration of neurobiological and psychological perspectives, highlighting the interplay between stress system dysregulation, neural circuit dysfunction, and maladaptive coping. A multi-scale framework, as seen in prenatal stress research [4], offers a template for understanding NSSI by considering molecular, physiological, and behavioral levels. This approach captures dynamic interactions between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, neurotransmitter systems, and prefrontal-limbic circuitry, contributing to NSSI vulnerability [4]. Examining these interconnected systems enhances understanding of factors influencing self-injurious behaviors.

At the neurobiological level, comprehensive models incorporate stress-induced glucocorticoid signaling alterations and their impact on neural plasticity. The HPA axis is central to these models, mediating early-life stress effects on NSSI risk [4]. Neuroendocrine changes interact with developmental alterations in prefrontal-limbic connectivity, creating a neural substrate of heightened emotional reactivity and impaired regulation. This perspective [4] highlights how macro-level neural changes arise from micro-level adaptations, including epigenetic modifications and neurotransmitter receptor sensitization, underscoring the need for an integrative framework to capture NSSI’s complexity.

Psychological components focus on reinforcement learning processes transforming NSSI from intentional coping to automatic behavior. These models incorporate habit formation principles, where distress and self-injury pairings create strong stimulus-response associations via corticostriatal circuits. Neurobiological changes, such as stress-induced dendritic remodeling and synaptic strengthening, influence this transition [2, 3, 4, 1]. These alterations emphasize the interplay between psychological and biological processes in NSSI persistence, highlighting how stress responses, particularly through the HPA axis, affect brain development and behavior.

Temporal dynamics are critical in comprehensive NSSI models, accounting for developmental trajectories and stress response progression. The multi-scale framework [4] emphasizes sensitive periods in stress system development, where early-life exposures induce lasting neurobiological changes manifesting as NSSI vulnerability during adolescence. These models delineate phases of NSSI development, from initial stress sensitization to maladaptive coping and habitual behavior, each with unique neuropsychological signatures. Understanding these dynamics is vital for identifying intervention windows to mitigate NSSI risk.

Future directions for comprehensive NSSI modeling should refine integration across biological and psychological levels, using advanced computational approaches to simulate dynamic interactions between stress systems, neural circuits, and behavior. Developing predictive models with multi-modal biomarkers, including those from prenatal stress research [4], could enable early identification of at-risk individuals and personalized interventions. Longitudinal studies tracking neurobiological and psychological co-evolution across developmental stages are essential for validating these integrated models, enhancing theoretical understanding and informing clinical practices to reduce NSSI incidence.

# 6.2 Future Research Directions

Future research on nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) should focus on biomarker development, methodological innovations, and longitudinal outcome studies. Standardizing early biomarkers for NSSI risk, particularly related to prenatal stress and stress system dysregulation [1], is crucial. Developing robust, noninvasive biomarkers for fetal stress responses requires advanced techniques to capture subtle neurodevelopmental alterations predisposing individuals to self-injury [4]. Integrating machine learning to analyze complex datasets of genetic, epigenetic, and neurophysiological risk factors can pave the way for earlier interventions altering NSSI trajectories.

Methodological advancements in neurophysiological assessment offer promising directions for refining NSSI research paradigms. The interpretable principal components analysis (LVPCA) framework [3] could be enhanced by incorporating penalty terms for biological constraints, enabling precise characterization of neural signatures associated with NSSI. Future applications should explore differentiating NSSI subtypes based on electrophysiological profiles, informing personalized interventions. Integrating LVPCA with real-time neurofeedback systems may enhance understanding of emotion regulation processes in NSSI populations, providing insights into managing emotional distress.

Longitudinal studies are crucial in NSSI research, particularly tracking stress system function from prenatal periods through adolescence. Research should identify sensitive intervention periods by examining early-life stress interactions with pubertal neurobiological changes increasing NSSI vulnerability [1]. These studies must incorporate multimodal assessments, combining neuroimaging, endocrine profiling, and behavioral measures to capture biological and psychological interplay across development. Special attention should be given to populations with prenatal stress exposures, utilizing improved biomarker panels [4] to predict long-term outcomes, enhancing understanding of NSSI mechanisms and intervention strategies.

Intervention research requires innovation in biological and psychological domains, emphasizing timing and personalization. Future studies should explore neuroplasticity-based interventions during critical developmental windows, targeting specific neural circuits implicated in NSSI maintenance. Developing closed-loop systems, dynamically adjusting therapeutic parameters based on physiological monitoring, could address temporal variability in NSSI pathophysiology. Utilizing population pharmacokinetic models to analyze stress response trajectories optimizes intervention timing relative to individual neuroendocrine profiles. Integrating physiological signals and epigenetic biomarkers associated with the HPA axis and ANS can better predict neurodevelopmental trajectories, tailoring early interventions for vulnerable populations, especially those exposed to prenatal stress [2, 3, 4, 1]. This approach will facilitate more effective and individualized treatment options for those at risk of NSSI.

Emerging computational psychiatry technologies offer opportunities for advancing NSSI research through predictive models integrating multi-scale data. Future work should focus on creating frameworks simulating dynamic interactions between stress systems, neural circuits, and behavior across development. These models could incorporate machine learning to analyze complex biomarker patterns [4], enabling early identification of high-risk individuals and personalized prevention strategies. Integrating advanced analytical methods, like extended LVPCA approaches [3], with large-scale longitudinal datasets will be essential for validating predictive models and translating findings into clinical practice. Leveraging these methodologies can enhance understanding of NSSI, developing targeted interventions addressing affected individuals’ unique needs.

# 7 Conclusion

The survey elucidates the intricate interplay of biological, psychological, and clinical dimensions underlying nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), underscoring the importance of stress system dysregulation as a central factor in its pathophysiology. The dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, with origins potentially rooted in prenatal stress exposures, is identified as a key element contributing to NSSI. Neurobiological data consistently point to disturbances in neurotransmitter systems, specifically within opioidergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic pathways, which correlate with disruptions in prefrontal-limbic circuits that detrimentally impact emotional regulation and impulse control.

The investigation into the temporal dynamics of NSSI highlights a shift from acute neurotransmission hyperreactivity to entrenched maladaptive stress responses, signifying progressive neural circuit reorganization. Utilization of sophisticated neurophysiological methodologies has advanced insights into the unique electrophysiological patterns and cortisol-related stress response trajectories associated with NSSI. These technological developments have facilitated a more nuanced understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings and evolution of NSSI.

The role of psychological trauma as a foundational factor in NSSI is emphasized, with early stress exposures triggering enduring neurobiological adaptations that heighten susceptibility to maladaptive coping mechanisms. By integrating trauma models with insights from behavioral neuroscience, the complex mechanisms of reinforcement and habit formation inherent in NSSI are further illuminated. Holistic models that merge biological and psychological aspects illustrate how stress-induced neurobiological alterations sustain maladaptive behavior cycles, perpetuating stress system imbalance.

Future research should prioritize the identification and validation of early biomarkers for NSSI risk, focusing on prenatal stress influences and stress biology development. Additionally, the creation of targeted intervention strategies, addressing specific neurobiological processes at pivotal developmental stages, remains imperative. The continuous blending of multidisciplinary methodologies, integrating cutting-edge neuroimaging, electrophysiological analysis, and detailed endocrine assessments, is vital for enhancing both theoretical frameworks and clinical applications in the realm of NSSI.
