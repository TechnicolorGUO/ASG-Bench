# 1 Introduction

Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) has emerged as a pivotal tool in the realm of biomedical research, providing researchers with the ability to visualize and monitor biological processes in real-time. This innovative imaging modality exploits the natural light-emitting properties of bioluminescent organisms, enabling the detection of light produced by luciferase enzymes in the presence of their substrates. The significance of BLI extends beyond mere visualization; it facilitates a deeper understanding of complex biological phenomena, including gene expression, cellular interactions, and disease progression. As the demand for non-invasive and precise imaging techniques grows, the role of BLI in both preclinical and clinical settings becomes increasingly critical. This review aims to elucidate the principles, advancements, and applications of BLI, emphasizing its transformative impact on biomedical research.

# 1.1 Overview of Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI)

Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is a powerful optical imaging modality that leverages the enzymatic reaction between luciferase enzymes and their substrates to generate detectable light signals in vivo. Unlike fluorescence imaging, BLI does not require external excitation light, thereby minimizing background autofluorescence and improving signal-to-noise ratios [1]. The technique relies on the oxidation of substrates such as D-luciferin, coelenterazine, or furimazine by luciferases (e.g., firefly, Renilla, or NanoLuc), producing photons in the visible to near-infrared spectrum. This intrinsic light emission enables real-time monitoring of biological processes, including gene expression, cellular proliferation, and disease progression, with high sensitivity and specificity. The ability to visualize these processes non-invasively represents a significant advancement in the field of molecular imaging.

A key advantage of BLI lies in its non-invasive nature, allowing longitudinal studies in the same subject without the need for sacrificial endpoints. The absence of ionizing radiation further distinguishes BLI from modalities like positron emission tomography (PET) or computed tomography (CT), making it safer for repeated use in preclinical models. However, BLI faces challenges in spatial resolution and depth penetration due to photon scattering and absorption in biological tissues. Advances in detector technologies, such as hybrid pixel detectors [2], have enhanced the ability to capture low-light signals with improved temporal and spatial precision. These innovations are critical for applications requiring quantitative analysis, such as tumor burden assessment or infection dynamics tracking. The ongoing development of more sensitive detectors and imaging algorithms continues to push the boundaries of what is achievable with BLI.

The versatility of bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is exemplified by its integration with multimodal imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound, enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of target localization in complex environments. This is particularly important in applications like radiotherapy, where precise imaging is crucial for minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues [1, 3]. By integrating BLI with other modalities, researchers can achieve synergistic benefits, such as correlating functional data from BLI with anatomical details from MRI. Future developments in luciferase engineering and substrate optimization are expected to address current limitations, expanding the utility of BLI in both preclinical and clinical settings. As the field advances, the potential applications of BLI are likely to grow, paving the way for innovative research methodologies and therapeutic strategies.

# 1.2 Significance of Luciferase Reporter Systems

Luciferase reporter systems serve as the cornerstone of bioluminescence imaging (BLI), enabling precise molecular and cellular tracking through their ability to convert biochemical activity into measurable light signals. These systems, which include firefly (Photinus pyralis), Renilla reniformis, and NanoLuc luciferases, exhibit distinct spectral properties, substrate specificities, and kinetic profiles, making them adaptable to diverse experimental needs [1]. The firefly luciferase-D-luciferin pair, for instance, emits light at approximately $5 6 0 \mathrm { n m }$ , while NanoLuc-furimazine produces a blue-shifted signal ( $4 6 0 \mathrm { n m } ,$ , allowing multiplexed imaging when combined with spectral unmixing techniques. This flexibility in spectral output is crucial for experiments requiring simultaneous monitoring of multiple biological processes.

The enzymatic nature of luciferase reactions ensures high specificity, as light emission occurs only in the presence of both the enzyme and its substrate, minimizing off-target signals. This specificity is critical for applications such as gene expression monitoring, where luciferase reporters are fused to promoters of interest to quantify transcriptional activity in real time. The inherent low background noise of bioluminescence imaging (BLI) significantly enhances its sensitivity compared to fluorescence-based methods, particularly in deep-tissue imaging applications, where the challenges of autofluorescence can obscure critical signals. This advantage is especially important in scenarios such as guiding conformal radiotherapy for soft tissue targets, where precise localization of tumors is crucial for effective treatment. For instance, the quantitative bioluminescence tomography (QBLT) system achieves localization accuracy of less than $1 \mathrm { m m }$ , demonstrating the potential of luciferase systems in clinical applications.

Advancements in luciferase engineering have further expanded their utility. For example, engineered variants like firefly luciferase mutants with red-shifted emission (e.g., Ppy RE9) improve tissue penetration by reducing hemoglobin absorption. Similarly, NanoLucs small size $\mathrm { 1 9 \ k D a ) }$ ) and high brightness facilitate its use in protein-protein interaction studies via bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). The integration of these systems with computational frameworks for real-time photon data analysis, as demonstrated by [1], has optimized the trade-off between temporal resolution and detection accuracy, enabling dynamic studies of rapid cellular processes. The continuous evolution of luciferase technologies promises further enhancements in imaging capabilities, supporting a wide range of applications in biomedical research.

Despite these advantages, challenges persist, including substrate bioavailability and the need for cofactors (e.g., ATP for firefly luciferase). Addressing these limitations through substrate engineering (e.g., esterified D-luciferin analogs for improved blood-brain barrier penetration) or the development of ATP-independent luciferases (e.g., Gaussia) remains an active area of research. The ongoing refinement of luciferase systems is expected to significantly enhance their utility in preclinical models, thereby facilitating advancements in translational applications, including precise intraoperative tumor margin delineation and detailed studies of immune cell trafficking. For instance, the development of quantitative bioluminescence tomography (QBLT) has shown promise in improving localization accuracy for soft tissue targets in radiotherapy. Enhanced luciferase imaging techniques could directly benefit treatment planning, ensuring effective tumor coverage during irradiation and highlighting the transformative potential of these systems in clinical settings.

# 2 Background

# 2.1 Historical Evolution of Bioluminescence Imaging

The evolution of bioluminescence imaging (BLI) as a pivotal biomedical tool has been significantly influenced by early studies of luminescent organisms and the engineering of luciferase reporter systems. Ancient observations of bioluminescence piqued curiosity, but scientific exploration commenced in the 19th century with the isolation of luciferin-luciferase systems from fireflies and marine organisms [1]. A major milestone was the 1947 purification of firefly luciferase, which elucidated light production mechanisms and paved the way for molecular imaging applications. The 1980s saw the cloning of the firefly luciferase gene, transitioning BLI from biochemical studies to visualizing gene expression in vivo. This era, marked by the advent of high-efficiency CCD cameras, enabled the capture of weak bioluminescent signals and the creation of transgenic models for non-invasive gene expression monitoring [2].

The early 2000s witnessed a proliferation of BLI applications, particularly in oncology and infectious disease research. Red-shifted luciferase variants and novel luciferases like NanoLuc enhanced tissue penetration and assay compatibility [1]. Hybrid imaging systems combining BLI with MRI or PET improved anatomical and functional data integration. Recent advancements focus on overcoming challenges such as substrate pharmacokinetics and signal quantification, with innovations like furimazine for NanoLuc and advanced bioluminescence tomography (BLT) algorithms enhancing signal localization precision. Developments in quantitative bioluminescence tomography (QBLT) have improved optical target localization, optimizing radiotherapy guidance and reducing experimental uncertainties [1, 3, 2]. Bioluminescent sensors for metabolites now broaden BLI’s utility in studying physiological processes, evolving it into a quantitative, multimodal research platform.

# 2.2 Fundamental Principles of Bioluminescence

Bioluminescence is an enzymatic chemiluminescent process where luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of luciferin, emitting light. This involves the formation of an excited oxyluciferin intermediate, which releases photons as it returns to its ground state [1]. The emission spectrum is determined by the luciferase-luciferin pair and environmental factors. Firefly luciferase emits yellow-green light at $5 6 0 \mathrm { n m }$ , while Renilla luciferase emits blue light at $4 8 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ . Quantum yield and reaction kinetics vary across systems, influenced by $\mathrm { p H }$ , temperature, and cofactors. Firefly luciferase requires ATP and $\mathbf { M } \mathbf { g } ^ { 2 + }$ , whereas NanoLuc operates independently of ATP, relying on furimazine oxidation. Light output is proportional to luciferase concentration and substrate availability, enabling precise in vivo measurements of biological processes [1, 3, 2].

For deep-tissue imaging, longer wavelengths $( 6 0 0 - 7 0 0 \mathrm { n m } )$ ) penetrate tissues effectively, minimizing absorption by hemoglobin and water. Engineered luciferases like red-shifted firefly variants enhance signal detection in thick tissues. Shorter wavelengths $4 5 0 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ) face scattering and absorption challenges, affecting imaging contrast and localization. Near-infrared luciferases, such as Akaluc, address this by emitting above $6 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ , optimizing tissue transparency [1, 3, 2]. Bioluminescence’s lack of external excitation light eliminates autofluorescence and photobleaching, advantageous in low-light conditions [1]. Advances in luciferase engineering, including split-luciferase systems and BRET-based sensors, extend its applicability in studying protein interactions and signaling dynamics. Future research aims to optimize reaction kinetics and emission spectra, enhancing BLI’s sensitivity and versatility.

# 3.2 Challenges in Low-Light Imaging

Detecting and quantifying low-light signals in bioluminescence imaging (BLI) involves overcoming significant technical challenges due to the weak photon flux from luciferase reactions. Emitted photons, often between $1 0 ^ { 2 } 1 { \bar { 0 } } ^ { 4 }$ per second per cell, require highly sensitive detectors with minimal noise [1]. Traditional charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras, though common, suffer from readout noise and dark current, obscuring faint signals, particularly in deep-tissue imaging where photon scattering and absorption further reduce signal strength. Hybrid pixel detectors, combining CMOS technology with advanced cooling, offer improved noise performance and temporal resolution [2], yet their high cost and complexity hinder widespread adoption.

Figure 3 illustrates the primary challenges in low-light imaging, emphasizing technical difficulties, optimization strategies, and substrate limitations, showcasing their impact on improving bioluminescence imaging applications. Spatial resolution in BLI is limited by the diffuse propagation of bioluminescent light through tissues. Photon scattering blurs signals, complicating source localization, especially in deep-tissue contexts where absorption by hemoglobin, melanin, and water diminishes detectable intensity, particularly for shorter wavelengths from luciferases like Renilla and NanoLuc. Quantitative bioluminescence tomography (QBLT) algorithms attempt to reconstruct three-dimensional light source distributions using computational models of tissue optical properties, though accuracy heavily relies on prior anatomical and optical parameter knowledge, often imperfectly characterized [1].

Optimizing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is crucial, as background noise from ambient light, detector noise, and autofluorescence can overwhelm weak signals. Noise mitigation strategies include spectral filtering, time-gated detection, and advanced image processing techniques like wavelet denoising and principal component analysis, though these may trade temporal resolution for SNR. Machine learning frameworks like WaldNet [1] show promise in dynamically adjusting detection thresholds, balancing sensitivity and specificity, though generalizability across diverse conditions remains under research.

Substrate-related limitations further challenge low-light imaging. The pharmacokinetics of substrates like D-luciferin and coelenterazine significantly affect bioluminescent signal dynamics. Variability in bioavailability, biodistribution, and clearance rates impacts light output, critical for accurate imaging and quantification in applications such as quantitative bioluminescence tomography.

Future directions include developing deep learning-based reconstruction frameworks to accelerate processing times and engineering near-infrared luciferases optimized for QBLT’s depth penetration needs, expanding its utility in research and clinical settings.

# 4.3 Data Acquisition and Analysis Methods

Capturing and processing bioluminescence imaging (BLI) data involves techniques designed to optimize signal detection, reduce noise, and enable quantitative analysis of bioluminescent sources. Multi-projection and multi-spectral imaging enhance spatial resolution and spectral unmixing capabilities. Multi-projection imaging captures signals from multiple angles, improving depth localization and mitigating photon scattering effects in tissues [3]. Multi-spectral imaging, using tunable filters or filter wheels, isolates emission spectra from overlapping luciferase reporters or autofluorescence, facilitating multiplexed studies and improving signal specificity.

Noise reduction strategies are essential for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in BLI. Temporal binning integrates photon counts over extended exposure times, improving SNR at the cost of temporal resolution, suitable for static processes. Spatial binning combines adjacent pixels, reducing readout noise but sacrificing spatial detail. Advanced denoising algorithms, such as wavelet transforms or non-local means filtering, preserve resolution while suppressing noise artifacts. Hybrid pixel detectors, as noted by [2], further mitigate noise using CMOS technology to minimize dark current and readout noise, enabling real-time low-light imaging with high fidelity.

Signal quantification in BLI requires normalization to account for variables like substrate availability, tissue attenuation, and detector sensitivity. Bioluminescence flux, measured in photons per second per steradian per square centimeter $\mathrm { ( p h o t o n s / s / s r / c m ^ { 2 } ) }$ ), is a standardized metric for cross-study comparisons. Calibration protocols using phantom models with known luciferase concentrations ensure consistent signal quantification. For dynamic processes, kinetic modeling of substrate-enzyme interactions provides insights into reaction rates and enzyme concentrations. Computational frameworks like WaldNet [1] dynamically adjust detection thresholds based on real-time photon statistics, optimizing sensitivity and specificity in quantitative analyses.

Emerging computational techniques expand the analytical toolkit for BLI data. Machine learning algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enhance spatial resolution in reconstructed images by learning patterns from paired BLI and anatomical imaging data. Spectral unmixing algorithms, such as linear regression or non-negative matrix factorization, decompose mixed signals into constituent luciferase contributions, enabling multiplexed imaging with minimal crosstalk. Integrating these methods with QBLT reconstruction pipelines, as demonstrated by [3], improves accuracy in three-dimensional source localization. Future advancements in data acquisition hardware, such as single-photon detectors, and analysis software, such as deep learning-based denoising, will further refine BLI’s precision and throughput in preclinical and translational applications.

# 6 Challenges and Future Directions

Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) continues to advance, yet several challenges persist that limit its effectiveness in research and clinical applications. Addressing the technical limitations inherent in current BLI systems is essential for enhancing imaging capabilities. These limitations include signal detection issues, spatial resolution constraints, and instrumentation challenges, all of which require innovative solutions. Overcoming these challenges is vital for improving methodologies and ensuring BLI’s adaptability to complex biological investigations and clinical scenarios, ultimately benefiting scientific research and patient care.

# 6.1 Technical Limitations of Current BLI Systems

BLI’s performance in preclinical and translational applications is hindered by several technical limitations. Achieving high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) is challenging due to the weak photon flux from luciferase reactions, typically ranging from $1 0 ^ { 2 }$ to $1 0 ^ { 4 }$ photons per second per cell [1]. Ultrasensitive detectors, such as cooled charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and hybrid pixel detectors, are required but are vulnerable to readout noise, dark current, and non-uniform pixel responses, particularly at signal discontinuities [2]. The integration of monolithic detector arrays further complicates performance uniformity, necessitating research into more reliable detection methods.

Spatial resolution is limited by the diffuse propagation of photons through tissues, with scattering and absorption by hemoglobin and melanin blurring signals, complicating the resolution of closely spaced sources and deep-tissue localization. Quantitative bioluminescence tomography (QBLT) algorithms attempt 3D source distribution reconstruction but depend heavily on anatomical priors and optical property estimates, which are often imprecise [3]. Variability in tissue composition introduces additional uncertainty, particularly in longitudinal studies where physiological changes alter light attenuation profiles.

The dynamic range of BLI systems poses another limitation, as the wide variation in signal intensities challenges detector linearity and saturation thresholds. High-intensity signals can obscure weaker ones, especially in multiplexed imaging where spectral overlap necessitates careful calibration [1]. Instrumentation constraints, such as the need for specialized cooling systems and limited field of view, further complicate BLI’s application. Integrating BLI with multimodal systems like MRI or CT presents alignment and synchronization challenges, crucial for procedures like conformal radiotherapy [1, 3, 2]. Emerging solutions, including machine learning-based noise reduction and adaptive optics, show promise but require further validation. Future advancements in detector technologies and computational methods are expected to mitigate these constraints.

# 6.2 Signal and Substrate-Related Challenges

The efficacy of BLI is closely tied to the pharmacokinetic and biochemical properties of luciferase substrates, presenting challenges for quantitative and longitudinal studies. Substrate bioavailability varies, with D-luciferin showing slow blood-brain barrier penetration and heterogeneous tissue distribution, affecting neuroimaging signal kinetics [1]. Coelenterazine suffers from rapid autoxidation and poor solubility, necessitating intravenous injections or synthetic formulations. Interspecies substrate metabolism differences complicate cross-species translational studies.

The kinetic profiles of substrate-enzyme interactions also influence imaging outcomes. Firefly luciferase-D-luciferin reactions enable longitudinal monitoring but complicate rapid kinetic analyses, while NanoLuc-furimazine reactions require precise temporal synchronization due to their short-lived signals [2]. ATP dependence introduces variability, as intracellular ATP fluctuations can confound interpretations. Engineered substrates aim to address these issues but often involve complex synthesis, increasing costs and limiting accessibility.

Cost and scalability are practical barriers to widespread BLI adoption. Furimazine is more expensive than native luciferins, restricting its use in large-scale studies. Low quantum yields necessitate higher substrate concentrations, increasing reagent costs [1]. Addressing these financial challenges through cost-effective substrates and scalable production methods is essential for broader BLI application.

Emerging solutions focus on substrate engineering and alternative delivery strategies, such as covalent modification with targeting moieties or nanoparticle encapsulation to improve bioavailability. Human-compatible substrates like AkaLumine expand BLI’s translational potential but require rigorous toxicity profiling. Future research should develop bioorthogonal substrates resistant to endogenous metabolism and integrate advanced pharmacokinetic models to optimize dosing regimens [1, 3, 2].

# 6.3 Emerging Technologies and Innovations

Recent advancements in BLI are addressing limitations through innovations in luciferase engineering, substrate design, and multimodal integration. Near-infrared (NIR) luciferase systems, such as Akaluc and Antares2, emit light above $6 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ , enhancing tissue penetration [1]. Stabilized substrate analogs like AkaLumine and hydrofurimazine improve pharmacokinetics, extending imaging windows and reducing dosing frequencies.

As illustrated in Figure 6, the figure highlights the key advancements in Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI) technology, detector innovations, and synthetic biology tools. This visual representation emphasizes the integration of luciferase engineering, substrate design, and multimodal imaging, while also showcasing improvements in detector sensitivity and radiation hardness. Furthermore, it underscores the expansion of molecular sensing capabilities through synthetic biology innovations.

Detector technology innovations, such as hybrid pixel detectors, are overcoming low-light sensitivity barriers, achieving single-photon sensitivity with sub-millisecond temporal resolution [2]. Future refinements aim to improve sensor material radiation hardness and integrate with multimodal systems. Multimodal imaging platforms, combining BLI with modalities like MRI and PET, enhance spatial resolution and correlate bioluminescent signals with anatomical data. Machine learning approaches in QBLT enable real-time 3D reconstruction, augmented by ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging for concurrent structural and functional data [3].

Emerging synthetic biology tools expand BLI’s molecular sensing capabilities. Bioluminescent biosensors for neurotransmitter dynamics and second messenger signaling provide insights into intricate signaling pathways [1, 3, 2]. CRISPR-mediated genome editing facilitates endogenous luciferase knock-ins, while bioluminescent voltage indicators bridge optical and electrophysiological techniques. Future directions include engineering human-compatible luciferase systems and developing wireless implantable detectors for chronic monitoring.

Research should refine collimator designs for radiation delivery precision and develop machine learning-based approaches to reduce artifacts in heterogeneous tissues. Integration with real-time photon processing frameworks like WaldNet could improve robustness and efficiency [1].

Luciferase engineering is crucial for developing human-compatible enzymes and substrates, enhancing imaging techniques like QBLT for better localization and treatment accuracy [1, 3]. Nearinfrared luciferases would mitigate tissue attenuation, and ATP-independent systems could reduce metabolic confounding. Future work should explore nanoparticle-based delivery systems and bioorthogonal chemistry to improve substrate pharmacokinetics. Multiplexed imaging tools using orthogonal luciferase-substrate pairs would enable simultaneous tracking of multiple processes, provided spectral unmixing algorithms can overcome crosstalk limitations.

Instrumentation innovations are essential to overcome sensitivity and resolution barriers. Nextgeneration detectors, like superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs), promise to push low-light imaging limits, while adaptive optics could compensate for photon scattering. Hybrid systems integrating BLI with modalities like photoacoustic tomography or Raman spectroscopy enhance imaging by providing structural and molecular insights. Standardizing quantitative metrics across platforms is critical for reproducibility and multicenter studies [1, 3].

Emerging applications in synthetic biology and cellular therapy present new opportunities for BLI tool development. Bioluminescent biosensors for metabolites, ions, and electrical activity can transform dynamic cellular physiology studies. CRISPR-engineered endogenous reporters facilitate more physiologically relevant gene expression monitoring [1, 3]. For clinical translation, addressing luciferase immunogenicity and substrate toxicity is essential, potentially through humanized enzyme designs or encapsulated delivery systems. Longitudinal studies in large animal models are crucial for validating advancements and establishing BLI’s role in precision medicine.
