Despite technological advancements, the sector remains the most hazardous in the United States, accounting for nearly $20 \\%$ of workplace fatalities [1]. This elevated risk profile stems from multiple interrelated factors, including the dynamic nature of construction environments, reliance on manual safety inspections, and workforce limitations. A critical constraint emerges from the shortage of experienced safety professionals, particularly in small businesses, which restricts the implementation of comprehensive safety programs [1].\n\n![](images/cd8864ccbac79c2b1fa8ab27bfdfd61e20bad4d0aa6ab6946eb4fd028b065943.jpg)  \nFigure 1: chapter structure\n\nHuman error constitutes a predominant contributor to safety incidents, often exacerbated by fatigue, inadequate training, and cognitive overload during complex tasks. The absence of real-time monitoring systems further compounds these risks, as traditional periodic inspections fail to capture transient hazards such as improper equipment usage or unstable structural conditions. Environmental volatilitycharacterized by unpredictable weather patterns, uneven terrain, and the presence of overlapping work zonesintroduces significant challenges that complicate the implementation of conventional safety protocols in the construction industry. This unpredictability not only heightens the risk of accidents but also underscores the necessity for advanced safety solutions, such as AI-driven technologies, to enhance hazard identification and management. Recent studies have demonstrated that integrating AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), can improve safety practices by providing accurate information and insights, although careful evaluation and prompt engineering are crucial to mitigate potential errors and ensure worker safety [1, 2].\n\nTechnological limitations in existing hazard detection systems further constrain safety management. Many current solutions lack the computational efficiency for real-time processing or struggle with false positives in cluttered construction scenes. The construction industry’s current reliance on reactive safety measures, which often address hazards only after incidents occur, highlights an urgent need for the implementation of advanced computer vision systems that can proactively identify potential hazards before they lead to accidents. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and deep learning techniques like the Single-Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), present significant opportunities to enhance safety protocols. These technologies can analyze data from surveillance cameras and other sources to monitor construction sites in real-time, enabling project managers to optimize resource utilization and improve safety outcomes. However, successful integration of these technologies necessitates a thorough understanding of their capabilities and limitations, as well as the importance of human oversight in areas where AI may struggle, such as complex reasoning and emergency response scenarios [1, 2]. These challenges collectively highlight the imperative for AI-driven solutions that address both human and systemic vulnerabilities in construction safety frameworks.\n\nThe construction industry’s safety challenges are compounded by a complex interplay of factors that require multifaceted solutions. Addressing these challenges necessitates a collaborative approach, integrating technological advancements with robust training programs and improved safety protocols. The exploration of AI-driven solutions, particularly in the context of real-time monitoring and hazard detection, holds promise for significantly enhancing safety outcomes. As the sector continues to evolve, it is essential to prioritize the adoption of innovative technologies that can effectively mitigate risks and promote a culture of safety."
