      "heading": "2.1 Theoretical Foundations of Coalition-Building",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "Coalition-building is underpinned by feminist theory, critical pedagogy, and emancipatory frameworks that confront systemic inequities through collaborative praxis. Intersectional feminism critiques patriarchal structures, advocating strategies that foreground marginalized identities, while critical pedagogy emphasizes dialogic education to enable collective liberation [1]. These frameworks reject reductionist approaches, promoting multi-issue coalitions that address the complex nature of oppression [2]. Intersectionality, a key aspect of feminist epistemology, illustrates how racial capitalism and algorithmic injustice intensify marginalization, necessitating nuanced social justice strategies. In this context, DS4SJ frameworks and initiatives like MetaMath prioritize systemic analysis and community collaboration to ensure marginalized groups actively shape discourse [3, 4]. Data-driven methodologies further enhance coalition efforts by providing empirical insights into strategy effectiveness.\n\nParticipatory design and augmented reality (AR) technologies augment coalition-building by centering excluded voices and redefining social justice praxis. AR critiques highlight its influence on identity through performativity and visibility, emphasizing critical engagement with technological tools [5]. Site-specific frameworks demonstrate ARs potential to elevate community engagement and empower marginalized groups [6]. However, structural barriers, including privacy risks [7] and limitations in retweet coordination detection [8], reveal tensions between coalition ideals and technological constraints, requiring careful scrutiny of technology’s dual capacity to hinder and advance coalition-building efforts.\n\nFuture coalition-building theories must bridge gaps between intersectional praxis and scalable mobilization, particularly as algorithmic systems mediate solidarity. Integrating frameworks like linguistic justice with AR pedagogy [9] and reimagining information retrieval as a humanizing tool [1] show promise for future research. Combining quantitative techniques, such as petition platform analytics [10], with qualitative depth through QTBIPOC participatory design [11], can enrich both the theoretical and practical dimensions of coalition-building."

      "heading": "2.2 Decolonial and Intersectional Frameworks",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "Decolonial and intersectional frameworks critically assess the influence of historical and systemic power structures on contemporary social movements, advocating for prioritizing marginalized voices to combat epistemic violence. These approaches interrogate colonial legacies embedded in data practices and algorithms, promoting equity-focused models that prioritize community agency. Intersectionality, as discussed by Crenshaw and Collins, highlights how oppressions compound across race, class, gender, and sexuality [12]. Algorithmic audits, demonstrated by Vecchione, expose how technologies replicate historical biases [13], essential for institutional accountability and preventing perpetuation of existing prejudices.\n\nMedia analyses, such as those by Rozado, underscore regional disparities in prejudice framing, necessitating intersectional methodologies responsive to geopolitical contexts [12]. Educational initiatives in computer science reveal tensions between decolonial praxis and institutional resistance. Lin advocates for curricula integrating intersectional and decolonial lenses to foster socially just environments [14]. These critiques resonate with demands to reconceptualize data justice as participatory processes, enabling communities to co-design tools countering datafication harms [15]. Future methodologies should address both scalability and specificity, ensuring coalition strategies neither flatten differences nor imitate extractive research practices.\n\nFuture directions require interdisciplinary collaboration to bridge theoretical and practical gaps. Integrating decolonial critiques of AI with intersectional activism could reveal how algorithmic systems perpetuate racialized exploitation [16]. Participatory audits and media analyses offer accountability models, demonstrating collaborative approaches to challenge systemic injustices. By centering marginalized epistemologies within technological design and movement-building, scholars and practitioners can promote equitable futures and contribute to an analytically rigorous, emancipatory vision of justice."

      "heading": "3.1 Feminist Theory and Political Mobilization",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "Feminist theory enriches political mobilization strategies by emphasizing intersectional analyses of power and advocating for transformative justice. Scholars like Crenshaw and Collins highlight how systemic oppressionsrace, class, gender, sexualityintersect to shape political agency and resistance, challenging reductionist approaches and promoting multi-issue coalitions [2]. This perspective advocates for a holistic approach to mobilization, recognizing the unique experiences and needs of diverse communities.\n\nFeminist theory critiques racial capitalism and algorithmic injustice, which perpetuate inequities through technical systems, urging integration of community-driven data justice frameworks [17].\n\nHowever, Western dominance in data justice discourse often marginalizes non-Western epistemologies, highlighting the need for feminist methodologies that prioritize situated knowledges and participatory design, as seen in QTBIPOC-led initiatives [11]. By centering marginalized voices, feminist theory enhances activism’s effectiveness, ensuring strategies are responsive to those most affected by systemic injustices.\n\nDigital spaces further demonstrate feminist theory’s impact on mobilization tactics. Axelrod’s latent sharing-space model shows how retweet coordination on Twitter can map association networks, providing insights into decentralized activist networks [8]. Feminist critiques caution against overreliance on algorithmic tools due to surveillance and epistemic erasure risks [7]. Feminist mobilization increasingly combines digital tools with grassroots organizing, amplifying marginalized voices while mitigating technological harms, fostering a participatory and inclusive political landscape.\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, the role of feminist theory in political mobilization encompasses key areas such as intersectional analysis, digital mobilization tactics, and future directions. This figure emphasizes the integration of diverse perspectives and methodologies to enhance political agency and resistance. Future directions involve integrating feminist AI critiques with emancipatory pedagogies, such as linguistic justice in augmented reality-based education [9]. Bridging quantitative rigor (e.g., petition platform analytics [10]) with qualitative depth, feminist theory advances mobilization strategies that are scalable and contextually grounded. Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to address gaps between intersectional praxis and algorithmic mediation, ensuring political mobilization remains rooted in justice-oriented epistemologies, empowering activists to navigate contemporary justice struggles.\n\n![](images/fa00250e3401badcdf5b0218f4897ff3f8de885f8223b9c9cc8e2815a785bfef.jpg)  \nFigure 2: This figure illustrates the role of feminist theory in political mobilization, highlighting key areas such as intersectional analysis, digital mobilization tactics, and future directions.

      "heading": "3.2 Racial Capitalism and Algorithmic Injustice",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "Racial capitalism and algorithmic injustice are intersecting frameworks revealing how systemic inequities are perpetuated through economic and technological structures. Vargas theorizes racial capitalism as exploiting racial distinctions to extract surplus value, reinforcing hierarchies of disposability and marginalization [16]. This intersects with algorithmic injustice, where technical systems encode and amplify inequities through biased design and governance [18]. Understanding these interconnections helps reveal how economic exploitation and technological oppression are mutually reinforcing mechanisms perpetuating social injustices.\n\nAlgorithmic audits are crucial for exposing these dynamics, showing how decision-making systems perpetuate discrimination. Vecchione’s work highlights how social science audits identify discriminatory patterns in algorithmic outputs, linking findings to broader racial capitalist structures [13]. Balch critiques reformist approaches to algorithmic justice, arguing that technical fixes alone cannot dismantle structural inequities [18]. This underscores the need for intersectional activism targeting both economic and technological oppression dimensions, developing comprehensive strategies addressing systemic injustice’s multifaceted nature.\n\nEmerging methodologies in data justice and participatory design challenge these systems. Community-driven audits center marginalized voices in evaluating algorithmic harms, aligning with intersectional critiques of racial capitalism [13]. The persistence of algorithmic injustice highlights isolated interventions’ inadequacy, necessitating coalitions integrating labor organizing, policy advocacy, and technical accountability [16]. Future research must bridge these domains, developing frameworks addressing racial capitalist and algorithmic systems’ material and epistemic violence. Fostering interdisciplinary collaboration enables activists and scholars to create robust strategies challenging inequities and envisioning a just, equitable society."

    {
      "heading": "4.1 Case Studies of Successful Movement Alliances",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "Empirical analyses highlight how strategic alliances leverage technology, data, and intersectional frameworks to enhance impact. The Carter Center’s conflict-mapping initiative, using AI-driven event classification, synthesizes diverse data sources into actionable insights for peacebuilding, facilitating timely interventions [19]. Similarly, environmental justice coalitions integrating satellite imagery with ecological considerations in solar installation projects demonstrate the balance of technological precision with sustainability [19]. These examples emphasize the importance of contextspecific metrics, stakeholder collaboration, and adaptive methodologies for project success, illustrating a trend towards data-driven approaches in addressing social issues. Figure 3 illustrates the key components of successful movement alliances, highlighting strategic alliances using technology, coalition dynamics through demographic and statistical analyses, and digital coalition-building with retweet coordination and intersectional audits.\n\nComparative studies of petition platforms further reveal coalition dynamics. Topaz’s demographic analysis of academic advocacy letters shows that inclusivity in signatory composition correlates with broader mobilization efficacy, highlighting the advantage of diverse coalitions in engaging wider audiences [20]. Aragón’s exploration of online petitioning supports this, demonstrating how statistical models quantify the relationship between coalition breadth and policy influence [10]. These datadriven approaches enable movements to optimize outreach strategies while addressing structural inequities in digital activism, underscoring the importance of inclusivity in enhancing movement alliances.\n\nDigital spaces facilitate decentralized coalition-building, as Axelrod’s analysis of retweet coordination during the 2022 U.S. midterm elections shows. The study maps latent association networks, revealing organic solidarity through algorithmic mediation [8]. However, tensions between scalability and inclusivity arise as platform architectures often privilege dominant voices. Future coalitionbuilding must integrate intersectional audits of algorithmic systems with grassroots mobilization to ensure technological tools serve marginalized communities. The interplay between digital activism and coalition dynamics highlights the need to critically examine online interaction structures in pursuing social justice."

      "heading": "4.2 Role of Technology in Coalition Dynamics",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "Technology reshapes coalition formation and dynamics by mediating communication, amplifying collective action, and introducing structural vulnerabilities. Digital tools have transformed movement organization, engagement, and mobilization. Algorithmic audits, as conceptualized by Vecchione, critically evaluate how technological systems either reinforce or disrupt coalitional efficacy [13]. These audits expose systemic biases, such as discrimination in facial recognition algorithms, highlighting how racial capitalism embeds inequities within technical infrastructures [16]. Marcoux’s framework further elucidates how repressive legislation alters social network structures, testing digitally mediated alliances’ adaptability [21]. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing strategies that enhance coalition resilience against technological and political challenges.\n\n![](images/2bf4b87b9a876c353a2644913f2b70c6b15cd46134e08f3a3b2a8102379d7654.jpg)  \nFigure 3: This figure illustrates the key components of successful movement alliances, highlighting strategic alliances using technology, coalition dynamics through demographic and statistical analyses, and digital coalition-building with retweet coordination and intersectional audits.\n\nDecentralized coordination tools, such as retweet networks, exemplify technology’s dual role in coalition-building. Axelrod’s analysis demonstrates organic solidarity through algorithmic interactions, revealing scalability-inclusivity trade-offs [8]. These findings highlight technology’s potential to connect diverse groups while exposing vulnerabilities related to unequal access and representation. Participatory design methodologies counter these limitations by centering marginalized voices in technological development, as seen in QTBIPOC-led initiatives integrating intersectional critiques into platform design [11]. Privacy risks and surveillance threats persist, especially for coalitions under repressive regimes, necessitating frameworks balancing mobilization efficacy with security [7]. A nuanced understanding of technology’s role in coalition dynamics is imperative for fostering inclusive and resilient movements.\n\nEmerging technologies like augmented reality (AR) complicate coalition dynamics. Gunderson’s feminist critique of AR highlights its potential to amplify performative activism while risking identity commodification [5]. Conversely, Silva’s site-specific AR applications show how localized, community-driven deployments foster tangible solidarity by visualizing systemic inequities [6]. These applications illustrate technology’s potential to empower rather than oppress. Future research must address the tension between technological mediation and coalitional autonomy, developing tools that resist co-optation while advancing intersectional justice. Interdisciplinary collaboration is needed to bridge algorithmic accountability [13] and grassroots praxis, ensuring technology serves as an emancipatory force in movement-building."

    {
      "heading": "4.3 Participatory Design and Grassroots Mobilization",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "Participatory design (PD) in grassroots mobilization emphasizes co-creation and community agency, challenging top-down development paradigms by centering marginalized voices in technological and organizational decision-making. This methodology fosters environments where community members actively contribute to design processes, ensuring tools and strategies reflect their needs. Rooted in emancipatory traditions, PD methodologies align with intersectional feminist critiques of power asymmetries, ensuring design processes reflect lived experiences of those most affected by systemic inequities. The QTBIPOC PD framework exemplifies this, integrating queer and trans Black, Indigenous, and People of Color perspectives into technology design to address intersecting oppressions [11]. By centering these perspectives, PD enhances technological solutions’ relevance and empowers marginalized communities to shape tools impacting their lives.\n\nGrassroots mobilization leverages PD to democratize data justice, as seen in community-driven audits of algorithmic systems. Vecchione’s typology of algorithmic audits underscores participatory methodologies’ necessity in exposing discriminatory patterns, linking technical analysis to broader social justice goals [13]. These audits hold institutions accountable, ensuring technological systems do not perpetuate existing inequalities. However, tensions arise between scalability and inclusivity, as PD’s labor-intensive nature limits its adoption in large-scale movements [17]. Hybrid models, like Mitra’s \"emancipatory information retrieval\" framework, combine participatory principles with scalable digital tools, enabling marginalized communities to reclaim epistemic agency in data-driven activism [1]. This synthesis of participatory design and scalable methodologies represents a promising avenue for enhancing grassroots mobilization efforts.\n\nAugmented reality (AR) technologies illustrate PD’s potential and pitfalls in grassroots contexts. Site-specific AR applications, like Silva’s, show how localized, community-co-designed interventions visualize systemic inequities in physical spaces, fostering tangible solidarity [6]. These interventions not only raise awareness but also encourage community engagement in addressing depicted issues. Conversely, Gunderson’s feminist critique warns against AR’s commodification of identity, highlighting performative activism risks overshadowing material change [5]. These contradictions necessitate PD frameworks prioritizing accountability, ensuring technologies serve grassroots needs rather than corporate or state interests. Careful integration of participatory design principles with emerging technologies can enhance grassroots movements’ effectiveness, fostering a more inclusive and just society.\n\nFuture directions require integrating PD with data-driven organizing strategies, like petition platform analytics [10] and retweet coordination mapping [8], while resisting algorithmic co-optation. The synthesis of participatory design and grassroots mobilization must address structural barriers, including digital divides and surveillance risks [7], by advancing intersectional, decolonial methodologies that center community autonomy and long-term systemic transformation. Collaboration between technologists and grassroots activists can create tools that facilitate mobilization and empower communities to advocate for their rights effectively."

      "content": "Intersectional activism recognizes the intertwining of various forms of oppression, such as race, class, gender, and sexuality, and their collective impact on marginalized groups. This concept, introduced by Kimberlé Crenshaw, underscores the necessity for activist strategies that are both inclusive and responsive to these overlapping systems of discrimination. By investigating the strategies employed by activists, we gain insight into how interconnected oppressions influence mobilization efforts and inform the broader social justice discourse.\n\nTo further illustrate these concepts, Figure 4 presents a hierarchical structure of intersectional activism, highlighting key strategies and frameworks. This figure categorizes the main themes into interconnected oppressions and activist strategies, as well as fairness metrics and community engagement, detailing specific approaches within each category. The visual representation underscores the integration of digital mobilization, participatory design, and community-led audits in activism, alongside the importance of fairness metrics and grassroots engagement in shaping technological interventions.\n\nThe following subsection delves into these themes, focusing on specific strategies that emerge from acknowledging interconnected oppressions, and sets the stage for a nuanced discussion on their implications for contemporary activism."

      "level": 1,
      "content": "Intersectional activism translates the recognition of interconnected oppressions into strategies that address their compounded effects on marginalized communities. Leslie’s data justice framework critiques the inequities arising from datafication, emphasizing how algorithmic systems perpetuate structural violence without intersectional analysis [17]. Vargas highlights the exploitation of marginalized labor in AI development, reinforcing extractive economic relations [16]. These insights urge a reevaluation of traditional activist methodologies to incorporate holistic approaches that consider diverse experiences.\n\nDigital mobilization showcases the interplay between interconnected oppressions and activist practice. Axelrod’s study of retweet coordination during the 2022 U.S. midterm elections shows how algorithmic platforms shape coalitional behavior, forming distinct user clusters around political and cultural advocacy [8]. However, algorithmic visibility often favors dominant narratives, necessitating hybrid strategies that combine digital tools with grassroots organizing to ensure inclusivity. By leveraging both digital and traditional methods, activists can create inclusive spaces that amplify marginalized voices.\n\n![](images/6114b646373e4a4c91af9b15e118fea7e9950246de6e65eac26f36734287f436.jpg)  \nFigure 4: This figure illustrates the hierarchical structure of intersectional activism, highlighting key strategies and frameworks.

This figure includes references to critical frameworks and studies that address data justice, exploitation in AI, retweet coordination, and strategies for inclusive and effective social activism.\n\nParticipatory design and community-led audits present models for addressing these challenges. Leslie’s data justice framework centers marginalized epistemologies in research and activism, rejecting universalist approaches that flatten difference [17]. Future strategies should integrate quantitative analyses of digital mobilization [8] with qualitative critiques of racial capitalism [16], ensuring interventions are both analytically rigorous and emancipatory. This integrative approach enhances activist strategies’ effectiveness and fosters a deeper understanding of systemic issues, contributing to sustainable and impactful social movements."

      "heading": "5.2 Fairness Metrics and Community Engagement",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "Fairness metrics are vital for evaluating and mitigating biases in algorithmic systems, aligning technological interventions with equity and justice principles. Green’s framework advocates for a culture of accountability in data science, where fairness metrics drive systemic change [22]. This challenges the depoliticization of algorithmic design, urging metrics that reflect marginalized communities’ lived experiences and address inequity’s root causes. By embedding community perspectives into fairness metric development, activists can create relevant tools that resonate with those they serve.\n\nBalch critiques the limitations of fairness metrics when isolated from community engagement, emphasizing that technical solutions alone cannot dismantle entrenched power structures [18]. Meaningful accountability requires participatory methodologies that center marginalized voices in algorithmic systems’ development, auditing, and deployment. Community-driven audits operationalize fairness metrics through collaborative praxis, linking quantitative bias assessments to critiques of racial capitalism and intersectional oppression [18]. This participatory approach enhances metrics’ legitimacy and empowers communities to shape technologies affecting their lives.\n\n![](images/125f7195c4ad95e33abf8b33652af8872e5e1983810c52335a2c59050ce5235d.jpg)  \nFigure 5: This figure illustrates the hierarchical structure of intersectional activism, highlighting key areas such as interconnected oppressions, digital mobilization, and strategic activism. It includes references to critical frameworks and studies that address data justice, exploitation in AI, retweet coordination, and strategies for inclusive and effective social activism.\n\nIntegrating fairness metrics with grassroots activism reveals tensions between scalability and contextual specificity. While standardized metrics facilitate comparability across systems, they may oversimplify complex, localized inequities experienced in transnational movements, as seen in social media campaigns like Black Lives Matter and Stop Asian Hate [1, 12, 23]. Future frameworks should prioritize hybrid models combining universal fairness principles with adaptable, communityspecific indicators, ensuring metrics remain responsive to evolving activist needs. This synthesis calls for interdisciplinary collaboration between data scientists, social theorists, and organizers to bridge technical rigor and emancipatory praxis, advancing algorithmic justice and contributing to a more just society."
