Through a systematic analysis of observational data from cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and Type Ia supernovae, we identify persistent discrepancies that suggest either unaccounted systematics or new physics beyond CDM. The paper evaluates theoretical resolutions including modified gravity, early dark energy, and alternative dark matter candidates, while highlighting the critical role of CMB anomalies in probing early universe dynamics. Key findings reveal that current tensionsparticularly the S clustering parameter and CMB statistical anisotropiescannot be fully resolved within standard frameworks. We emphasize the necessity of multi-probe approaches combining next-generation CMB experiments, 21cm cosmology, and gravitational wave astronomy to distinguish between systematic effects and fundamental new physics. The survey concludes with recommendations for future research directions, including precision tests of fundamental constants, unified dark sector models, and advanced computational tools for analyzing non-Gaussian signatures in cosmological data."

      "content": "Cosmological tensions and early universe anomalies serve as critical probes for testing the limits of the Standard Model of cosmology (CDM) and identifying potential physics beyond it. The Hubble tension, characterized by the discrepancy between local and early-universe measurements of the Hubble constant $H _ { 0 }$ , exemplifies how observational anomalies can challenge fundamental cosmological assumptions. Independent low-redshift measurements, such as those from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB), provide a robust distance scale for Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), further highlighting the tension and necessitating rigorous model evaluations [1]. This discrepancy not only raises questions about the reliability of current measurements but also suggests that our understanding of cosmic expansion may require a reevaluation of underlying principles.\n\n![](images/032cd202537205e3db4f3376a4f33edc4bafb59947245e4ff8fc3a28dfc487c6.jpg)  \nFigure 1: chapter structure\n\nSimilarly, particle physics anomaliesranging from neutrino oscillations to axion-like particlesmay signal deviations from the Standard Model of particle physics, with profound implications for cosmology. For instance, the discovery of unexpected neutrino behaviors could indicate new interactions or particles that may alter our understanding of cosmic evolution. The implications of such findings extend beyond theoretical physics, as they may also inform our understanding of dark matter and dark energy, which are essential components of the universe’s composition. The interplay between cosmology and particle physics thus remains a rich area for exploration, with each anomaly serving as a potential gateway to new discoveries.\n\nThe cosmic microwave background (CMB) remains a cornerstone for cosmological inference, yet anomalies in its temperature and polarization spectra reveal inconsistencies that demand scrutiny. For instance, deviations from statistical isotropy and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect challenge the cosmological principle, as evidenced by observations relevant to the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). These discrepancies underscore the need for refined observational methodologies, such as inflection-point inflation models that balance predictive power with minimal parameterization. The CMB’s role as a probe of the early universe is thus complicated by these anomalies, which necessitate a more nuanced understanding of cosmic evolution and structure formation.\n\nBeyond empirical challenges, these anomalies illuminate gaps in our understanding of fundamental processes. Primordial nucleosynthesis, for example, faces uncertainties in nuclear reaction rates, such as the radiative capture $d ( p , \\dot { \\gamma } ) ^ { 3 } \\mathrm { H e }$ , which affect the primordial deuterium abundance [2]. Such uncertainties can have cascading effects on our models of cosmic evolution and the formation of light elements. The accelerating universe, inadequately explained by CDM alone, motivates investigations into dynamical dark energy or transitions in cosmological constants. Gravitational wave backgrounds of cosmological origin further enrich this landscape, offering new avenues to probe early universe physics [3].\n\nCosmological parameter estimates derived from observational data play a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of the universe, particularly in the context of the standard cosmological model [4]. However, primary challenges persist, including the lack of understanding of the fundamental nature of dark matter and dark energy, as well as the initial matter inhomogeneities [5]. The measurement of cosmological time dilation (CTD) within the expanding universe further refines existing models, highlighting the dynamic interplay between theory and observation [6]. Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), instrumental in discovering the universe’s accelerated expansion, continue to play a crucial role in cosmological studies [7].\n\nUltra-high-energy cosmic rays present another frontier, with observed phenomena such as the ’knee’ and ’ankle’ in the cosmic ray spectrum challenging existing models [8]. These features not only question the mechanisms behind cosmic ray acceleration but also invite further investigation into their origins and implications for cosmic structure. Critiques of the big bang hypothesis also underscore the importance of empirical support in cosmological theories [9]. Collectively, these tensions and anomalies not only refine existing models but also guide future experiments and theoretical breakthroughs, shaping the next generation of cosmological inquiry. The exploration of these phenomena thus represents a critical frontier in our quest to understand the universe’s fundamental nature."

      "level": 1,
      "content": "The CDM model, based on the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric, is the dominant framework for describing cosmic evolution, large-scale structure, and the universe’s accelerated expansion. It integrates key components: a cosmological constant () for dark energy $( 6 8 \\% )$ , collisionless cold dark matter (CDM, $2 7 \\%$ ), and baryonic matter $( 5 \\% )$ , with neutrino contributions limited to $\\sum m _ { \\nu } < 0 . 1 2 \\mathrm { e V } .$ . Grounded in Einstein’s field equations, the model explains how matter and energy influence spacetime curvature. However, extensions like $f ( R )$ gravity, which modify the Einstein-Hilbert action, suggest the need for refinement to accommodate certain observations [18].\n\nObservational support for CDM comes from precise measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). Planck CMB data confirm spatial flatness $( \\Omega _ { k } = 0 . 0 0 1 \\pm 0 . 0 0 2 )$ and acoustic peak structures predicted by CDM. BAO measurements from surveys like SDSS-III serve as \"standard rulers\" for testing the distance-redshift relationship, reinforcing the model’s validity across scales. However, tensions such as the Hubble tension $( H _ { 0 } )$ and the $S _ { 8 }$ discrepancy challenge CDM, suggesting further investigation into cosmic expansion and small-scale structure predictions.\n\nExtensions to CDM, such as modified gravity theories and alternative dark sector dynamics, address these tensions. For example, vector field formulations alter CMB and large-scale structure spectra [19], while $f ( R )$ gravity introduces logarithmic corrections to the Ricci scalar [20]. The $\\Delta N$ -formalism expands theoretical models without assuming local homogeneity [21]. Tests of the CDM model must account for small deviations from the null hypothesis, as standard methods may overlook subtle anomalies indicating new physics [22].\n\nAlternative frameworks, like those challenging the big bang hypothesis, propose dark matter properties to explain cosmic observations [9]. These theories explore different initial conditions or interactions that may have shaped the universe’s evolution. Future probes, including gravitational wave standard sirens and $2 1 \\mathrm { c m }$ tomography, will test CDM’s validity across epochs, potentially uncovering phenomena that challenge established paradigms. While CDM remains dominant, its limitations highlight the need for beyond-Standard-Model physics to address anomalies in inflationary cosmology and dark sector dynamics [13]."

Dark matter, accounting for $27 \\%$ of the universe’s energy density, is inferred through its gravitational effects on galactic rotation curves, cluster dynamics, and gravitational lensing [23]. It remains undetected by electromagnetic means, with candidates like weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and axion-like particles (ALPs) [24]. The generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model proposes a unified description of dark matter and dark energy through an exotic equation of state [25].\n\nObservational evidence for dark matter is robust, with Planck CMB data constraining CDM density to $\\Omega _ { c } h ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 2 0 \\pm 0 . 0 0 1$ , ruling out pure baryonic scenarios [23].

Models with Lorentz invariance violation predict anomalous neutrino dispersion relations affecting nucleosynthesis [28]. The $U ( 1 ) _ { L }$ symmetry breaking scenario suggests domain wall formation could overclose the universe unless mitigated by inflation [29].\n\nFuture probes, like Euclid and LSST, will map dark energy’s redshift evolution, while CMB-S4 aims to detect primordial gravitational waves, refining our understanding of cosmic evolution [29]. The $S _ { 8 }$ tension between CMB and weak lensing data underscores the need for beyond-CDM physics [30]. Observational challenges drive theoretical innovation in dark sector physics, from modified gravity to interacting dark energy-neutrino couplings [31].\n\nThe contamination of cosmological parameter estimations by CIB fluctuations highlights the need for refined observational methodologies [32]. BAO in galaxy surveys provide precision measurements of dark energy, while statistical isotropy violations in the CMB challenge the cosmological principle [33]. Supernova cosmology faces challenges in dataset handling, requiring sophisticated statistical methods [7]. Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and their interactions with the CMB provide additional constraints on dark sector physics [8]. These observations and advancements underscore the dynamic interplay between dark matter, dark energy, and the cosmological framework, driving future inquiry."

This relic radiation encodes information about primordial density perturbations, spatial curvature, and the cosmic energy budget, testing the CDM model. The CMB’s blackbody spectrum and polarization patterns provide insights into early universe conditions, making it an essential tool for understanding cosmic evolution. The gravitational imprint of relic neutrinos on CMB fluctuations refines cosmological parameter constraints, enhancing our understanding of the universe’s composition [34]. Tools like the rCOSMO R package facilitate CMB data analysis, enabling robust comparisons between theory and observation [35].\n\nThe CMB power spectrum’s acoustic peaks are precision cosmological probes, providing information about fundamental parameters. The first peak at $\\ell ~ \\approx ~ 2 2 0$ constrains spatial curvature $( | \\Omega _ { k } | < 0 . 0 0 5 )$ and the Hubble constant, while higher-order peaks measure baryon density $( \\Omega _ { b } h ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 2 2 4 \\pm 0 . 0 0 0 1 )$ and dark matter distribution [36]. Second-order effects, like the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and lensing-induced mode coupling, complicate anisotropy interpretation, necessitating nonlinear treatments of the radiation transfer function [37]. The Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect introduces secondary anisotropies probing the thermal history of the universe, with galaxy clusters acting as foreground sources [37].\n\nCMB polarization measurements enhance cosmological constraints by probing reionization and the optical depth $\\tau$ . E-mode polarization, generated by scalar perturbations, has been mapped by Planck, though systematics must be controlled for precision [38]. B-mode polarization targets primordial gravitational waves, providing evidence for inflationary dynamics, while patchy reionization imprints signatures on anisotropies, offering insights into the epoch of reionization [38]. Cosmic voids, detected through CMB lensing, test dark energy and modified gravity scenarios, enriching the interplay between data and models [39].\n\nCMB anomalies challenge the cosmological principle of statistical isotropy, raising questions about CDM assumptions. Planck data reveal parity asymmetry in the CMB spectrum, suggesting potential departures from isotropic models [40]. Topological defects and inhomogeneous conditions could imprint non-Gaussian signatures detectable through higher-order statistics like the trispectrum [41]. The synergy of the CMB with other probes, including BAO and supernova surveys, enhances its power for testing alternative gravity and dark energy models [42].\n\nFuture CMB experiments will push precision cosmology forward, expanding understanding of the universe. Spectral distortions offer a window into particle physics, constraining decaying particles converting into photons, shedding light on interactions and dark matter [42]. Ground-based measurements for small-scale anisotropies will test CDM, while space missions targeting large-angle anomalies may reveal new physics beyond the Standard Model [9]. The CMB’s role as a test of cosmological models and a probe of fundamental physics ensures its centrality in resolving key tensions in modern cosmology, driving future research."

It posits a rapid exponential expansion after the Big Bang, stretching quantum fluctuations and seeding largescale structure. Inflation predicts a nearly scale-invariant power spectrum of curvature perturbations, with quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field as seeds for structure formation [43]. Planck 2015 data constrain inflationary models, favoring single-field slow-roll scenarios with tensor-to-scalar ratios $r < 0 . 0 7$ [44].

      "heading": "3.1 Overview of the Hubble Tension",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "The Hubble tension represents a critical challenge in modern cosmology, characterized by a statistically significant discrepancy between early- and late-universe measurements of the Hubble constant $H _ { 0 }$ . Local determinations, such as those from the SH0ES collaboration using Cepheidcalibrated Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), yield $H _ { 0 } = 7 4 . 0 3 \\pm 1 . 4 2 \\mathrm { k m / s / M p c }$ , while Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations under the $\\Lambda { \\bf C D M }$ framework predict $H _ { 0 } = 6 7 . 3 6 \\pm 0 . 5 4$ km/s/Mpca tension exceeding $4 \\sigma$ significance. The observed inconsistency between cosmic microwave background (CMB) predictions and measurements of cosmic structure growth poses significant challenges to the standard cosmological model, $\\Lambda { \\bf C D M }$ . This discrepancy suggests the possibility of unaccounted systematic errors in the data or the need for new physics beyond the current model. Recent analyses indicate that while the ΛCDM framework has successfully unified many observations across cosmic epochs, tensions remain, particularly between high-redshift CMB data and low-redshift growth measurements. These findings highlight the necessity for further investigation into the underlying parameters and potential alternative cosmological models that could resolve these inconsistencies.\n\nThe tension manifests through multiple independent probes. Recent measurements from the late universe, including Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), tend to yield higher values of the Hubble constant $( H _ { 0 } )$ when correlated with local distance ladder data. In contrast, early universe constraints derived from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) consistently support lower $H _ { 0 }$ estimates. Specifically, analyses combining BAO data with CMB observations suggest that $H _ { 0 }$ values can be significantly lower than those obtained from local measurements, with recent findings indicating a discrepancy of about $2 . 4 - 3 . 1 \\sigma$ between these two approaches. This persistent tension highlights the complexity of reconciling different cosmological data sets and suggests that the disagreement cannot be solely attributed to systematic errors in the CMB data. The degeneracy in cosmological parameter estimation, particularly in the $\\Omega _ { m } \\Omega _ { \\Lambda }$ plane, exacerbates the tension, as minor variations in these parameters significantly alter inferred $H _ { 0 }$ values. Interacting dark energy models and modifications to neutrino physics have emerged as potential resolutions, with recent analyses showing preference for scenarios that reconcile $H _ { 0 }$ values across probes.\n\nObservational systematics further complicate the tension. CMB foreground modeling, particularly the contribution of faint radio sources, introduces potential biases in $H _ { 0 }$ determinations. The bispectrum analysis of CMB data has been proposed to break parameter degeneracies, yet challenges persist in reconciling these measurements with local probes. Gravitational wave standard sirens, including kilonovae, offer complementary constraints, but their current precision remains insufficient to resolve the tension definitively. The implications of the Hubble tension extend beyond parameter estimation, probing fundamental aspects of cosmic evolution. If unresolved by current systematic approaches, the implications could extend to modifications in early-universe physics, potentially involving non-standard neutrino interactions or the introduction of early dark energy models, such as the dynamically evolving Quintom scenario, which suggests a transition in the equation of state of dark energy that could influence cosmic evolution. Future observations from next-generation CMB experiments and multi-messenger approaches will critically test these hypotheses, offering new avenues to resolve this defining challenge of contemporary cosmology.\n\nThe precision and accuracy of cosmological parameter estimates remain central to resolving the Hubble tension. The determination of the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $( N _ { e f f } )$ and the evidence for dark radiation, influenced by prior assumptions on $H _ { 0 }$ , further complicate the tension. Additionally, the challenge of establishing a consistent age for the universe underscores the broader implications of the Hubble tension for our understanding of cosmic evolution. Alternative interpretations of galactic redshift and the CMB suggest that the tension may reflect deeper theoretical uncertainties in the standard cosmological framework. The detection of BAO features at over $7 \\sigma$ significance, as reported by previous studies, provides a robust independent constraint on $H _ { 0 }$ yet discrepancies persist when compared to CMB-based estimates. These observational challenges drive theoretical innovation, from modified gravity to interacting dark energy-neutrino couplings, as the cosmological community seeks to reconcile these fundamental discrepancies. The Hubble tension thus serves as a litmus test for the robustness of the $\\Lambda { \\bf C D M }$ paradigm, with its resolution holding the potential to reshape our understanding of the universe’s expansion history."

SDSS-III galaxy clustering data yield $H _ { 0 }$ measurements independent of the distance ladder, yet BAO constraints remain sensitive to the assumed fiducial cosmology and redshift-space distortions. The stellar massbinding energy relation in galaxies introduces a novel cosmic ruler, enabling sub-percentage distance measurements at intermediate redshifts but requiring precise stellar population modeling. This method offers a complementary approach to traditional distance ladder techniques, highlighting the interplay between different cosmological measurements in constraining $H _ { 0 }$ .\n\nGravitational wave (GW) standard sirens, such as kilonovae, directly measure luminosity distances without cosmological assumptions, though waveform systematics and inclination angle degeneracies limit current precision to $\\sim \\bar { 1 } 0 \\%$ . Peculiar velocity corrections, as implemented in ALFALFA survey analyses, mitigate local bulk flow effects on $H _ { 0 }$ determinations but introduce uncertainties from reference frame transformations. The integration of these various methods is essential for obtaining a comprehensive view of the Hubble constant, as each approach contributes unique insights and constraints.\n\nEarly-universe probes, including cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), infer $H _ { 0 }$ indirectly through the sound horizon scale, with Planck data achieving $\\sim 1 \\%$ precision under ΛCDM assumptions. However, these methods exhibit strong model dependence, as alternative cosmologies or non-standard neutrino interactions can alter sound horizon calibration. Bayesian age-dating of the oldest stars provides complementary constraints, though stellar evolution models introduce systematic uncertainties in metallicity and initial mass function assumptions. The ongoing discrepancy between measurements of the Hubble constant $( H _ { 0 } )$ from late-universe observations and those derived from early-universe data, notably from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), highlights the critical necessity for multi-probe analyses that incorporate a range of cosmological observations. Recent studies have shown that independent constraints on $H _ { 0 }$ can be obtained from the ages of the Universe’s oldest stars, while joint analyses of cosmic growth and expansion data reveal a mild tension with CMB predictions, suggesting that a comprehensive approach is essential to resolve these inconsistencies and better understand the underlying physics of the Universe. While SNIa and BAO methods excel in local and intermediate redshift regimes, their reliance on astrophysical calibrations introduces degeneracies with cosmological parameters. GW standard sirens and CMB anisotropies offer model-independent and high-precision approaches, respectively, but remain limited by observational systematics and theoretical priors. Future advancements in photometric calibration, GW detector networks, and CMB spectral distortions will be critical for resolving the persistent Hubble tension.\n\n3.3 Observational Discrepancies and Key Results   \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Benchmark</td><td>Size</td><td>Domain</td><td>Task Format</td><td>Metric</td></tr><tr><td>PIQUE[50]</td><td>248</td><td>Cosmology</td><td>Angular Power Spectrum Measurement</td><td>E-mode and B-mode an- gular power spectra</td></tr><tr><td>eLISA[51]</td><td>500</td><td>Cosmology</td><td>Parameter Estimation</td><td>H0,8</td></tr><tr><td>CMB-FOREG[52]</td><td>600</td><td>Cosmology</td><td>Parameter Estimation</td><td>H0,8</td></tr><tr><td>BAO[53]</td><td>266,590</td><td>Cosmology</td><td>Cross-correlation Measure- ment</td><td>DH/rd,D/rd</td></tr><tr><td>CSP[54]</td><td>214</td><td>Astrophysics</td><td>Distance Measurement</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>RQMS[55]</td><td>100</td><td>Cosmology</td><td>Cmb Anomaly Detection</td><td>H0 Fisher Information</td></tr><tr><td>Planck+WiggleZ[56]</td><td>1,000,000</td><td>Cosmology</td><td>Parameter Estimation</td><td>Upper limit on neutrino mass</td></tr><tr><td>H(z)/H0-f8(z)[57]</td><td>1,000</td><td>Cosmology</td><td>Joint Analysis OF Cosmic Growth And Expansion</td><td>2,AIC</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nTable 1: This table provides a comprehensive overview of various benchmarks utilized in cosmology and astrophysics for measuring and estimating key parameters. Each benchmark is characterized by its size, domain, task format, and the specific metrics employed, highlighting the diversity of methodologies in addressing observational discrepancies and cosmological measurements.\n\nRecent observational campaigns have yielded precise but discordant measurements of the Hubble constant $H _ { 0 }$ , intensifying the Hubble tension. The Carnegie Supernova Project III reported $H _ { 0 } = 7 1 . 7 6 \\pm 0 . 5 8 \\mathrm { k m / s / M p c }$ (B-band) and $7 3 . 2 2 \\pm 0 . 6 8 \\ \\mathrm { k m / s / M p c }$ (H-band), reducing but not eliminating the tension with early-universe probes. These results, derived from improved photometric calibrations across multiple bands, highlight the sensitivity of SNIa-based measurements to systematic uncertainties in dust extinction and metallicity corrections. Independent validation comes from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method, which achieves comparable precision to Cepheid calibrations, with HST data analysis yielding consistent local $H _ { 0 }$ estimates. This convergence of results from different methodologies underscores the importance of cross-validation in cosmological measurements. Table 1 presents a detailed summary of the benchmarks employed in recent observational campaigns to address discrepancies in cosmological measurements, including the Hubble constant and other key parameters.\n\nBaryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements provide a complementary geometric approach. The Linear Point (LP) method, applied to BOSS data, demonstrates robustness against nonlinearities in the matter power spectrum, though traditional BAO analyses remain susceptible to redshift-space distortions and fiducial cosmology assumptions. SDSS-III galaxy clustering results confirm the BAO standard ruler’s consistency but reveal persistent discrepancies when combined with CMBderived sound horizon scales. A novel cosmic ruler based on the stellar mass-binding energy relation achieves sub-percentage distance measurements at intermediate redshifts, circumventing limitations of SNIa and BAO methods but requiring precise stellar population modeling. The integration of these various techniques is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of $H _ { 0 }$ and the underlying cosmological framework.\n\nGravitational wave (GW) standard sirens, particularly kilonovae, emerge as competitive distance indicators, with luminosity distance measurements independent of cosmological assumptions. These events provide $H _ { 0 }$ estimates consistent with both local and early-universe values, though current precision $( \\sim 1 0 \\% )$ ) limits their resolving power for the tension. Age-dating of ancient stellar populations offers an alternative constraint, with analysis of stars older than 13.3 Gyr yielding $H _ { 0 }$ values that account for stellar evolution systematics but remain sensitive to initial mass function and metallicity priors. The discrepancies between these methodologies underscore the complexity of the Hubble tension. Local measurements of the Hubble constant, such as those derived from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB), and gravitational waves (GW), consistently indicate higher values of $H _ { 0 }$ . In contrast, early-universe observations from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), along with constraints from stellar chronometers, suggest lower estimates. Recent analyses reveal that while CMB data provide the most stringent constraints on cosmological parameters, integrating these with local measurements tends to favor slightly closed spatial geometries and supports a lower Hubble constant, highlighting the ongoing \"Hubble tension\" between different measurement methods. Systematic uncertainties in photometric calibrations, nonlinear structure growth, and stellar evolution models contribute to the observed disparities, necessitating multi-probe campaigns to isolate potential new physics from observational biases. Future advancements in GW detector networks and next-generation BAO surveys will be critical for resolving these persistent discrepancies."

      "content": "The Hubble tension has motivated a diverse array of theoretical frameworks aimed at reconciling the discrepancy between early- and late-universe measurements of $H _ { 0 }$ , spanning modifications to the ΛCDM paradigm and novel physics scenarios. A fundamental challenge lies in parameter degeneracies, particularly between the primordial power spectrum and cosmological parameters, which obscure precise constraints on $H _ { 0 }$ when employing conventional methods. The Suspiciousness statistic offers a robust quantitative framework for assessing tensions between datasets, correcting for prior volume effects and revealing systematic offsets in parameter estimation. Such statistical tools are essential for understanding the underlying causes of the discrepancies and for guiding future theoretical developments.\n\nModified gravity theories present compelling resolutions. The scale-dependent backgroundpreserving gravity action introduces a dynamical gravitational constant $G$ and cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ , modifying the late-time expansion history to accommodate higher $H _ { 0 }$ values. The Tsallis holographic dark energy model, incorporating the Granda-Oliveros (GO) scale as an infrared cutoff, dynamically adjusts the vacuum energy density, successfully explaining the universe’s transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion while potentially alleviating the $H _ { 0 }$ tension. These models are critically tested through baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, which probe angular diameter distances and Hubble parameters across redshifts. The interplay between different cosmological observations is crucial for validating these theoretical frameworks.\n\nBeyond-Standard-Model physics provides additional mechanisms. The Stepped Partially Acoustic Dark Matter (SPartAcous) model introduces a dark matter component with acoustic oscillations prior to recombination, altering the sound horizon scale to reconcile $H _ { 0 }$ without exacerbating the $S _ { 8 }$ tension. Neutrino physics plays a pivotal role, with significant neutrino degeneracy potentially enhancing energy density and modifying the CMB power spectrum. The non-inflationary \"numen\" scalar field offers an alternative to inflation for generating CMB fluctuations, potentially revising early-universe conditions that influence $H _ { 0 }$ determinations. These theoretical advancements highlight the necessity of exploring new physics scenarios to address the Hubble tension.\n\nCosmic variations in fundamental constants present another avenue. The proposal that the speed of light may vary with cosmic time challenges traditional assumptions of its constancy, offering a theoretical explanation for observed discrepancies in the Hubble tension. Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) can significantly alter light element abundances during Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), indirectly affecting $H _ { 0 }$ constraints through modified early-universe physics. Variations in the finestructure constant $\\alpha$ and electron-to-proton mass ratio $\\mu$ imprint distinctive signatures on the $2 1 \\mathrm { c m }$ signal, providing additional probes of early universe dynamics. These considerations underscore the importance of a multifaceted approach to understanding the Hubble tension and its implications for our cosmological models.\n\nAdvanced statistical methodologies enhance model discrimination. Nested sampling and neural networks improve parameter estimation and model selection in supernova cosmology, enabling more robust comparisons between competing theoretical frameworks. Traditional goodness-of-fit tests often fail to detect subtle deviations from $\\Lambda { \\bf C D M }$ due to the overwhelming degrees of freedom in modern datasets, necessitating refined statistical approaches. The PLANCK experiment’s updated constraints on modified gravity parameters demonstrate the tightest bounds to date, with certain scenarios alleviating tensions in Hubble constant measurements. Future directions emphasize multi-probe analyses to distinguish between these scenarios. Next-generation CMB and large-scale structure surveys will test the viability of theoretical proposals, while advancements in gravitational wave cosmology and precision nucleosynthesis constraints provide complementary insights. Resolving the Hubble tension is crucial for advancing our comprehension of cosmic acceleration and the dynamics of dark sector physics, as it may necessitate significant revisions to the ΛCDM paradigm, particularly in light of the discrepancies highlighted by baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, the behavior of quartessence models, and the influence of local inhomogeneities on supernova luminosity distance calibrations.\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Feature</td><td>Type Ia Supernovae</td><td>Baryon Acoustic Oscillations</td><td>Gravitational Wave Standard Sirens</td></tr><tr><td>Measurement Technique Precision Level Waveform Systematics</td><td>Standardizable Candles Sub-3Systematic Challenges</td><td>Geometric Standard Ruler Metallicity, Dust Extinction</td><td>Luminosity Distance Measurement Redshift-space Distortions</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Table 2: Comparison of Measurement Techniques and Challnges in Determining the Hubble Con- stant Using Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscilations,and Gravitational Wave Standard Sirens.

This discrepancy raises questions about dark matter’s underlying physics and interactions, indicating that current models may not fully capture cosmic structure formation complexities. Many models that alleviate the Hubble tension inadvertently exacerbate the $S _ { 8 }$ discrepancy [81]. Local inhomogeneities further complicate parameter estimation, particularly for the Hubble constant $H _ { 0 }$ , indicating systematic challenges in relating luminosity distance measurements to dark matter distributions [11].\n\nSmall-scale structure formation anomalies challenge standard cold dark matter (CDM) predictions. The core-cusp problem, where observed dark matter halo density profiles exhibit flat cores rather than predicted cuspy profiles, and the missing satellites problem, involving an underprediction of observed satellite galaxies, remain unresolved [4]. These discrepancies are compounded by inconsistencies between large-scale and small-scale power spectra, as highlighted by galaxy clustering analyses from SDSS-III and BOSS surveys. The coupling between dark matter and Standard Model particles introduces additional complexity, with cosmological bounds on dark matter-photon interactions showing measurable effects on CMB anisotropies and matter power spectra [82]. Such interactions might alter the growth of structure and influence the universe’s thermal history, complicating our understanding of cosmological evolution.\n\nPrimordial nucleosynthesis reveals further challenges through the lithium problem, where theoretical predictions of $^ 7 \\mathrm { L i }$ abundances exceed observational values by a factor of 34. This discrepancy may indicate missing physics in dark matter models or nuclear reaction rates, given uncertainties in relic neutrino degeneracy and spectral indices [83]. The model dependence of cosmological constraints on neutrino properties introduces degeneracies with other cosmological parameters, complicating data interpretation [84]. Sterile neutrinos face stringent cosmological bounds, often exceeding laboratory experiment sensitivity [85]. These challenges underscore the need for a nuanced understanding of dark matter interactions and the fundamental physics governing cosmic evolution.\n\nAlternative dark matter frameworks, including scalar-tensor theories and continuum dark matter models, propose solutions to these anomalies while facing their theoretical constraints. The Z-portal continuum dark matter model attempts to reconcile observations with particle physics constraints while avoiding traditional WIMP model limitations [86]. However, these models must satisfy direct detection bounds and cosmological observations, presenting significant theoretical challenges [87]. The interplay between theoretical predictions and observational data remains a focal point of research, as scientists strive to develop models that accurately reflect the universe’s complexities.\n\nThe accurate prediction of extreme astrophysical systems, such as massive galaxy clusters, remains a critical test for dark matter models. Observations of these systems may probe the validity of the ΛCDM framework, particularly when combined with precision measurements of the CMB and large-scale structure [88]. Future multi-messenger observations, incorporating CMB spectral distortions, weak lensing, and 21cm cosmology, will be essential for resolving these persistent challenges and advancing our understanding of dark matter’s fundamental nature.
