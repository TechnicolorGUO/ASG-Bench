# 1 Introduction

The exploration of non-Hermitian physics has emerged as a transformative area of study within the broader context of quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics. Traditional Hermitian frameworks have long dominated these fields, providing a foundation for understanding quantum states, observables, and dynamics. However, the limitations of Hermitian operators have become increasingly apparent as researchers encounter complex systems characterized by gain and loss, non-reciprocal interactions, and other phenomena that cannot be adequately described within a Hermitian paradigm. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the key developments, phenomena, and implications of non-Hermitian physics, highlighting its significance in advancing theoretical understanding and practical applications. By systematically organizing the literature, this work seeks to clarify the evolving landscape of non-Hermitian systems and their potential to reshape our understanding of quantum mechanics.

# 1.1 Historical Context and Departure from Hermitian Frameworks

The historical trajectory of non-Hermitian physics represents a fundamental paradigm shift from conventional Hermitian frameworks, which have historically governed quantum mechanics and condensed matter systems. Early theoretical foundations emerged through the study of pseudoHermitian operators [1], where the relaxation of Hermiticity enabled the modeling of complex potentials and open quantum systems. This departure was necessitated by physical phenomena involving gain and loss mechanisms, particularly in photonic systems and active matter [2], where traditional

Hermitian descriptions proved insufficient. The need for alternative frameworks has driven significant research into non-Hermitian systems, revealing rich structures and behaviors that challenge established notions in quantum theory.

A critical breakthrough occurred with the formulation of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics [3], demonstrating that non-Hermitian Hamiltonians could yield real spectra under specific symmetry conditions. This challenged the long-standing assumption that Hermiticity was essential for unitary evolution and observable quantities. Concurrently, the discovery of exceptional pointsdegeneracies where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalescerevealed unique topological features absent in Hermitian systems [4]. These developments were further enriched by studies on nodal spectral functions [5], which highlighted the stabilization mechanisms in quantum materials beyond Hermitian constraints. The exploration of these phenomena has not only deepened our understanding of quantum mechanics but has also paved the way for innovative applications in technology and materials science.

The divergence from Hermitian frameworks became particularly pronounced in dissipative quantum systems [6], where non-Hermitian operators naturally arise due to environmental coupling. Theoretical advances in supersymmetric quantum mechanics underscored the limitations of Hermitian models, especially in singular potentials and higher-dimensional systems [7]. The double-scaling limit of anharmonic oscillators [8] further emphasized the need for non-perturbative approaches to address the instabilities inherent in non-Hermitian systems. As research continues to evolve, the implications of these findings resonate across various domains, influencing both theoretical frameworks and experimental methodologies.

Recent developments have extended these ideas to nonequilibrium systems, such as active matter and diffusive processes [9], where non-Hermitian topology governs emergent phenomena like the non-Hermitian skin effect. The interplay between chirality and macroscopic pattern formation [10] exemplifies the broader applicability of non-Hermitian physics. Additionally, the exploration of nonHermitian topology in flat-band systems [11] and the role of backscattering in generating complex eigenvalues [12] have further expanded the theoretical landscape. These advancements not only highlight the versatility of non-Hermitian systems but also underscore their potential to unveil new physics and applications in diverse fields.

The implications of non-Hermitian physics extend to foundational questions in quantum mechanics, such as the apparent non-conservation of energy and momentum in certain processes [13]. The introduction of PT-symmetric quantum electrodynamics [14] has also raised new challenges regarding probability conservation and the analytic properties of Green’s functions. These developments, coupled with the study of C-symmetries within Krein spaces [15] and vortex pinning in non-Hermitian quantum systems [16], continue to redefine the boundaries of quantum theory and condensed matter physics. As the field progresses, the interplay between theoretical insights and experimental realizations will undoubtedly shape the future of non-Hermitian physics, offering fresh perspectives on longstanding questions.

# 1.2 Key Phenomena in Non-Hermitian Physics

Non-Hermitian systems exhibit distinctive phenomena that diverge from Hermitian paradigms, driven by complex eigenvalue spectra, non-reciprocal couplings, and gain-loss asymmetry. The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) emerges as a central phenomenon, where eigenstates localize exponentially at system boundaries due to asymmetric hopping or dissipation [12]. This effect is intrinsically topological, as demonstrated by its sensitivity to boundary conditions and its manifestation in point-gap topological systems. The NHSE generalizes to systems with spatial symmetries, leading to variants such as the mirror skin effect [17], and persists in disordered or many-body contexts [18]. Understanding these phenomena is crucial for harnessing the unique properties of non-Hermitian systems in various applications, including quantum computing and materials science.

Exceptional points (EPs) represent another hallmark of non-Hermitian physics, where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce into branch-point singularities with non-trivial topological winding [19]. These degeneracies enable enhanced sensitivity in quantum sensing, achieving Heisenberg-limited precision near spectral phase transitions. The formation of exceptional rings in buoyancy-driven systems extends their applicability to fluid dynamics and asteroseismology [20]. EPs also play a critical role in spontaneous magnon decay in magnetic systems, revealing connections between non-Hermitian dynamics and collective excitations [21]. The exploration of EPs not only enriches theoretical understanding but also opens new avenues for practical applications in sensing and information processing.

Parity-time (PT) symmetry breaking constitutes a third key phenomenon, where balanced gain and loss lead to phase transitions between real and complex eigenvalue spectra. This symmetry underpins novel quantum electrodynamic frameworks [14], though challenges remain in reconciling unitarity with non-Hermitian dynamics. PT-symmetric systems exhibit unique transport properties, as seen in bosonic Kitaev chains [22], where non-reciprocal couplings enable topological edge modes. The interplay between PT symmetry and conservation laws highlights fundamental tensions between local physics and non-local quantum states [13]. Additionally, the role of C-symmetries within Krein spaces further enriches the theoretical framework of PT-symmetric systems [15]. Investigating these phenomena not only enhances our understanding of non-Hermitian systems but also fosters the development of innovative technologies that leverage their unique properties.

The interplay between these phenomena and many-body interactions remains an active area of research, particularly in the context of Kitaev chains and other strongly correlated systems [23]. Furthermore, the impact of non-Hermitian effects on transport properties, such as the Hall conductance in Chern insulators, reveals new avenues for exploring topological phases in open quantum systems [24]. These phenomena collectively challenge conventional Hermitian frameworks while enabling novel applications in quantum sensing, wave control, and topological robustness. As researchers continue to unravel the complexities of non-Hermitian physics, the implications for both theoretical advancements and practical applications will undoubtedly be profound.

# 2 Background and Preliminaries

# 2.1 Mathematical Foundations of Non-Hermitian Operators

The mathematical framework of non-Hermitian operators transcends Hermiticity, essential for modeling open quantum systems and non-conservative phenomena. Unlike Hermitian operators, which ensure real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenstates, non-Hermitian operators, defined by $H \neq H ^ { \dagger }$ , exhibit complex spectra and non-orthogonal eigenstates, necessitating a generalized spectral theory [27]. PT-symmetric quantum mechanics exemplifies this shift, where complex operators can yield real spectra under specific symmetries, challenging traditional paradigms and enabling the exploration of novel physics [28].

Non-Hermitian spectra, unlike Hermitian ones confined to the real axis, occupy complex planes where exceptional points (EPs) emerge as coalescing eigenvalues and eigenvectors [29]. The pseudoHermitian framework offers a cohesive perspective, with operators satisfying $\eta { \bar { H } } \eta ^ { - \bar { 1 } } = { \bar { H } } ^ { \dagger }$ for a metric $\eta$ , maintaining real spectra under certain conditions [15]. This formalism aids in decomposing Hilbert spaces into subsystems through commuting sub-algebras, independent of metric structure [30]. These mathematical constructs not only deepen our understanding but also enable practical quantum mechanics applications.

Functional analysis of non-Hermitian operators reveals unique topological characteristics absent in Hermitian systems. The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) arises from non-reciprocal couplings or asymmetric dissipation, causing eigenstate localization at boundaries [17]. This phenomenon is crucial for understanding localized states’ sensitivity to boundary conditions. Hydrodynamic analogs of the non-Hermitian Schrödinger equation illustrate this in chiral active matter, where edge flows are governed by non-Hermitian dynamics [31]. The interplay between non-Hermiticity and information flow enriches this framework, with non-Markovian dynamics quantified through trace distance measures [32].

Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians also facilitate novel device functionalities, with non-reciprocal transport emerging from engineered gain-loss profiles [23]. The interaction between non-Hermitian operators and probability currents in open quantum systems offers a thermodynamic perspective on energy dissipation and information transfer [33]. These mathematical foundations underpin diverse phenomena and applications, bridging abstract theory with experimental realizations. Exploring nonHermitian operators opens research avenues, particularly in understanding how these constructs can lead to innovative quantum mechanics technologies and applications.

A notable theoretical perspective maps non-Hermitian quantum mechanics to classical equilibrium statistical mechanics in higher dimensions, providing insights into phenomena like vortex pinning in non-Hermitian quantum systems [16]. This mapping underscores the deep connections between non-Hermitian operators and classical statistical mechanics, offering a powerful tool for analyzing complex quantum systems. The mathematical foundations of non-Hermitian operators thus offer a rich and versatile framework for exploring novel physical phenomena beyond Hermitian limitations.

# 2.2 Complex Eigenvalues and Spectral Properties

Non-Hermitian systems are characterized by complex eigenvalues, a stark contrast to Hermitian operators with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenstates. This distinction leads to unique dynamical behaviors and stability considerations [3]. PT-symmetric quantum mechanics exemplifies this, where real spectra can emerge from non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in the unbroken PT-symmetric phase [28]. The transition to complex eigenvalues, marking spontaneous PT symmetry breaking, signifies a critical spectral phase transition with profound implications for system dynamics [8].

Exceptional points (EPs), where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce into degenerate singularities, are topologically protected, characterized by non-trivial winding numbers in the complex eigenvalue plane [17]. Near EPs, systems exhibit enhanced sensitivity to perturbations, useful in quantum sensing applications [21]. Exceptional rings in parameter space generalize this phenomenon, connecting to hydrodynamic instabilities and classical systems [9]. Spectral stability near EPs is fragile, as minor perturbations can significantly alter eigenvalue trajectories, unlike in Hermitian systems.

The reality of spectra in certain non-Hermitian systems, like those with pseudo-Hermitian or PTsymmetric Hamiltonians, depends on a positive-definite metric operator $\eta$ ensuring the pseudoHermiticity condition $\eta H \eta ^ { - 1 } = H ^ { \dagger }$ [1]. This metric defines a modified inner product maintaining unitary time evolution, bridging non-Hermitian dynamics with conventional quantum mechanics [3]. When spectra become complex, systems exhibit non-unitary evolution, often linked to gain or loss mechanisms. Supersymmetric quantum mechanics further elucidates this interplay, where complex superpotentials generate real spectra under specific constraints [34].

In topological contexts, complex eigenvalues are crucial in non-Hermitian band theory, where gaps in the complex plane define new insulating and metallic phases [12]. Gap closures at EPs signal topological phase transitions, accompanied by boundary-localized states. Spectral properties also influence magnon decay rates in magnetic systems, where complex eigenvalues correspond to finite lifetimes of collective excitations [21]. These features challenge conventional bulk-boundary correspondence principles, necessitating generalized frameworks for non-Hermitian topology [17].

Theoretical advances in non-Hermitian spectral theory continue to reveal novel phenomena, such as spectral stability in discrete systems with complex potentials [7]. Future directions include exploring spectral properties in many-body non-Hermitian systems and their implications for quantum information processing, where complex eigenvalues may encode new forms of topological protection and error correction. The rich interplay between complex eigenvalues, exceptional points, and spectral stability underscores the transformative potential of non-Hermitian physics in redefining quantum and classical dynamical systems.

# 2.3 Gain and Loss Mechanisms in Open Quantum Systems

Gain and loss mechanisms in open quantum systems, arising from non-unitary interactions with external environments, fundamentally alter system dynamics compared to closed Hermitian systems. These mechanisms are modeled through non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, where gain (amplification) and loss (dissipation) appear as imaginary spectrum components [6]. Non-Hermitian interactions enhance the stability of nodal points, contrasting with the fragility of Hermitian systems’ nodal degeneracies [5]. This stabilization emerges from the complex eigenvalue structure, enriching the understanding of system behavior near spectral degeneracies.

Relaxation dynamics in driven-dissipative quantum systems showcase how external reservoirs influence system behavior [35]. Quantum dot arrays coupled to normal metal leads exemplify this, where gate-controlled dissipation engineering creates non-Hermitian topological states with tunable gain-loss profiles [36]. Such systems exhibit unique steady-state properties under nonequilibrium conditions, where boundary effects and particle statistics significantly influence stationary behavior [37]. Manipulating these gain-loss dynamics opens new avenues for designing quantum devices with enhanced functionalities.

In Josephson junctions, non-Hermitian effects manifest through exceptional points in Andreev bound state spectra, altering supercurrent-phase relations and enabling enhanced sensitivity to phase biases [19]. The PT-symmetric quantum electrodynamics framework further elucidates these phenomena, demonstrating how balanced gain and loss can preserve probability conservation despite non-Hermitian dynamics [14]. However, challenges persist in minimal Kitaev chains, where Majorana zero modes require precise parameter tuning to maintain stability against dissipation [38]. This highlights the delicate balance necessary for achieving desired quantum states in non-Hermitian systems.

The delocalization transition in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians relates to the depinning of flux lines from defects in superconductors, underscoring the connection between gain-loss mechanisms and vortex dynamics [16]. Quantum quenches in dissipative fermionic systems reveal the dynamical impact of gain-loss asymmetry, with Markovian drive and dissipation leading to non-trivial steady states [39]. The non-Hermitian skin effect adds complexity, as boundary-localized states modify the system’s response to external perturbations [29]. These phenomena collectively illustrate the intricate interplay between system dynamics and external influences.

The computation of non-Markovian stochastic Schrödinger equations is simplified through auxiliary random fields, offering a powerful tool for analyzing gain-loss dynamics in open quantum systems [32]. Coupling to an environment with gain and loss affects Hall conductance quantization in Chern insulators, demonstrating the interplay between non-Hermitian effects and topological protection [24]. Radiation-free topological modes in magnonic devices offer potential solutions to radiative damping challenges, leveraging inertial effects to suppress losses in quantum information processing [31].

The exploration of gain and loss mechanisms in open quantum systems redefines control paradigms, enabling novel functionalities in quantum sensing and information processing while presenting theoretical challenges in stability analysis and topological protection. Future research aims to enhance understanding of non-Markovianity in high-dimensional systems by developing generalized measures quantifying memory effects in open quantum processes. Additionally, integrating engineered dissipation mechanisms with topological error correction schemes, leveraging insights from nonHermitian topology, could improve noise immunity and performance in quantum systems. This integration may lead to innovative designs for multimode amplifiers and oscillators that maintain high power handling while effectively mitigating noise, advancing quantum information processing [40, 32, 41, 42].

# 3 Non-Hermitian Skin Effect

The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) marks a departure from traditional Hermitian physics by manifesting as eigenstate localization at the boundaries of non-Hermitian systems. This arises from non-reciprocal couplings, gain-loss dynamics, and complex eigenvalue spectra, challenging conventional bulk-boundary correspondence. NHSE extends beyond theoretical interest, providing insights into photonics, condensed matter physics, and quantum mechanics. To understand NHSE’s theoretical foundations, we examine non-Hermitian extensions of established lattice models, setting the stage for analyzing its implications across various physical contexts. Table 1 provides a detailed comparison of the theoretical and experimental aspects of the non-Hermitian skin effect, emphasizing its implications for wave control and topological robustness. Figure 2 illustrates the hierarchical structure of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), classifying key concepts, theoretical models, experimental realizations, challenges, and implications for wave control and topological robustness. This figure highlights the overarching topic of NHSE, branching into theoretical foundations and models, experimental observations, and implications for advanced applications. Specific theoretical models, experimental platforms, and their unique challenges and applications are categorized under each branch, showcasing NHSEs multifaceted role in modern physics and enhancing our understanding of its diverse implications.

# 3.1 Theoretical Foundations and Models

NHSE emerges from frameworks deviating from Hermitian systems via non-reciprocal couplings, gain-loss asymmetry, and complex spectra. Lattice models, like non-Hermitian extensions of the SuSchrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and Hatano-Nelson chains, demonstrate this through asymmetric hopping terms inducing boundary-localized eigenstates [43]. The Hatano-Nelson model exemplifies this, where non-reciprocal hopping $t _ { R } \neq t _ { L }$ creates point-gap topology, localizing eigenstates at one edge [25]. These models show NHSE as a single-particle phenomenon distinct from many-body localization [43].

Continuum theories extend NHSE beyond tight-binding approximations using the non-Hermitian Schrödinger equation with complex potentials or spatially varying gain-loss profiles, capturing skin effect dynamics in waveguides and gyrotropic media [30]. These models require modified bulkboundary correspondence principles, as standard Hermitian rules fail to predict NHSE-induced localization [17]. The extension of the Schrödinger formalism to gyrotropic media provides a unified framework for analyzing NHSE in electromagnetic systems [30].

Connections between NHSE and vortex pinning in superconductors reveal insights into delocalization transitions in systems with random potentials [16]. Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians describe this transition, where disorder and non-Hermiticity govern eigenstate localization. The Hatano-Nelson model under different boundary conditions illustrates the skin effect and its topological implications, showing how boundary conditions alter spectral and localization properties [25]. This highlights NHSE’s broader relevance in complex phenomena and encourages further exploration.

Analyzing bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems provides a foundation for understanding NHSE, highlighting the breakdown of conventional Hermitian principles [17]. This necessitates new tools to predict boundary-localized states. The interplay between non-Hermitian topology and NHSE enriches the landscape, revealing phenomena like robust zero-energy states and exceptional points in Josephson junctions [25]. These foundations establish NHSE as a distinct nonHermitian phenomenon with implications from quantum sensing to topological protection. Models predict non-Hermitian systems’ behavior through analytical and numerical techniques, enhancing the theoretical framework and facilitating experimental implementations in contexts like energy and mass diffusion, topological properties, and biological dynamics [4, 10, 44, 45, 32]. Future research includes exploring NHSE in higher dimensions and developing generalized bulk-boundary correspondence principles for non-Hermitian topological phases.

# 3.2 Experimental Realizations and Challenges

NHSE has been experimentally demonstrated across platforms like photonic lattices, ultracold atomic systems, and electrical circuits, revealing significant challenges in observation and control. Photonic waveguide arrays with engineered gain-loss profiles serve as versatile platforms for NHSE, where asymmetric coupling mimics non-reciprocal hopping in the Hatano-Nelson model [46]. Simulations of such systems, particularly with periodic boundary conditions, highlight nonlinearity’s role in modulating NHSE dynamics and stability [46]. However, controlling gain-loss balance is demanding due to fabrication imperfections and environmental fluctuations disrupting PT symmetry, necessitating careful design and execution.

Ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices offer another avenue, where dissipative processes are engineered through atom loss or laser-induced transitions. NHSE in these systems is sensitive to boundary conditions and interaction strengths, with many-body correlations adding complexity beyond single-particle descriptions [43]. Technical challenges include maintaining uniform dissipation across lattices and distinguishing NHSE-induced localization from disorder or interaction effects. High-resolution imaging techniques are needed to resolve edge-localized states, emphasizing the need for advancing measurement technologies.

Electrical circuit networks complement these platforms, with non-reciprocal couplings implemented via active elements like operational amplifiers. These systems map non-Hermitian models to impedance networks, observing NHSE through voltage and current measurements [25]. Challenges include scaling circuits while maintaining noise stability and component tolerances. The skin effect’s sensitivity to boundary conditions complicates interpretation, necessitating rigorous frameworks to discern genuine NHSE from other phenomena.

A challenge across platforms is distinguishing NHSE from trivial boundary effects or disorderinduced localization. The absence of universal NHSE signatures requires cross-validation through multiple techniques and modeling. The interplay between nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity introduces instabilities that can destabilize skin modes, especially in driven-dissipative systems [46]. Future advances will require improved tuning of non-reciprocal parameters and protocols to mitigate noise-induced decoherence in quantum NHSE realizations. Addressing these challenges is essential for unlocking NHSE’s full potential in applications.

# 3.3 Implications for Wave Control and Topological Robustness

NHSE fundamentally alters wave dynamics and topological robustness in open quantum systems, enabling novel functionalities in photonic and acoustic metamaterials. Giant microwave sensitivity in magnetic systems shows how NHSE-induced boundary localization enhances non-local excitation and detection, surpassing conventional sensors [47]. This sensitivity arises from exponential state accumulation at boundaries, amplifying system response to perturbations. In Josephson junctions, NHSE and exceptional points enhance supercurrents, suggesting applications in quantum sensing and switching devices [19]. Non-equilibrium steady states in these systems exhibit NHSE-specific occupation patterns, distinct from traditional localization measures [37].

Topological robustness in NHSE systems manifests through point-gap topology, where pseudoeigenstates and quasi-particle damping create temperature-dependent spectral properties [43]. This topology provides unconventional protection against disorder, as boundary-localized states remain robust despite bulk perturbations. Quasi-particle damping introduces a trade-off between topological protection and coherence times, necessitating careful gain-loss profile engineering. Photonic lattices leverage NHSE for unidirectional waveguiding, where asymmetric mode localization enables nonreciprocal light propagation immune to backscattering [47]. Acoustic metamaterials exploit NHSE for directional sound amplification, with applications in noise control and ultrasonic imaging. These advancements underscore NHSE’s transformative potential in shaping future technologies.

Theoretical studies show NHSE modifies bulk-boundary correspondence, requiring generalized topological invariants to predict edge states [43]. This redefinition has implications for fault-tolerant quantum computing, where NHSE could enable new error correction schemes based on boundarylocalized logical qubits. NHSE-related spectral properties’ temperature dependence suggests tunable topological phases in solid-state platforms, with applications in thermally reconfigurable devices [43]. Future research includes integrating NHSE with nonlinear effects for enhanced wave control and developing quantitative measures for topological robustness in open systems. These explorations will deepen understanding of non-Hermitian physics and pave the way for innovative applications in technology and materials science.

# 4 Boundary Phenomena in Non-Hermitian Systems

Understanding boundary phenomena in non-Hermitian systems is crucial as it reveals the complex interplay between exceptional points and PT symmetry, foundational concepts in this field. This section explores the theoretical basis of these phenomena, illustrating how exceptional points emerge as critical spectral degeneracies and how PT symmetry influences the spectral characteristics of nonHermitian Hamiltonians. Establishing this framework enhances our appreciation of their broader implications in non-Hermitian physics and applications in quantum sensing and topological materials. The next subsection will expand on this foundation by examining the non-Hermitian skin effect and its role in boundary localization, highlighting the unique properties distinguishing non-Hermitian systems from Hermitian counterparts.

# 4.1 Theoretical Foundations of Exceptional Points and PT Symmetry

Exceptional points (EPs) and parity-time (PT) symmetry are fundamental constructs in nonHermitian physics, characterized by unique spectral properties and symmetry conditions that diverge from Hermitian paradigms. EPs appear as spectral degeneracies where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, forming branch-point singularities with non-trivial topological winding numbers in the complex eigenvalue plane [25]. These points differ from Hermitian degeneracies due to their defective eigenspace structure, requiring Jordan block representations for spectral decomposition. The topological protection of EPs is linked to non-zero winding numbers $\begin{array} { r } { \nu ^ { ' } = \frac { 1 } { 2 \pi i } \oint _ { C } \nabla _ { \theta } \overset { \cdot } { \mathrm { a r g } } ( \lambda ( \theta ) ) d \theta } \end{array}$ where $C$ encircles the EP in parameter space and $\lambda ( \theta )$ denotes the complex eigenvalue trajectory.

PT symmetry allows non-Hermitian systems to exhibit real spectra, governed by $[ P T , H ] = 0$ This ensures eigenvalues are real or form complex conjugate pairs, with transitions indicating spontaneous PT symmetry breaking. In the unbroken PT-symmetric phase, a positive-definite metric operator $\eta$ maintains real eigenvalues, establishing pseudo-Hermiticity through $\eta H \eta ^ { - 1 } = H ^ { \dagger }$ . This guarantees Hamiltonian boundedness and diagonalizability, facilitating unitary evolution under a modified inner product. The metric operator’s choice impacts subsystem definitions in composite quantum systems, influencing the $\mathbf { C } ^ { * }$ -algebra structure and enabling well-defined decompositions regardless of the metric’s tensor product form [1, 48]. In the broken phase, gain-loss imbalance leads to non-unitary dynamics and exponential amplification or decay.

$\mathrm { E P s } ^ { \prime }$ physical significance lies in their enhanced sensitivity to perturbations, with eigenvalue splittings scaling as $\sqrt { \epsilon }$ for small perturbations $\epsilon$ , compared to linear $\epsilon$ scaling in Hermitian degeneracies. This underpins applications in quantum sensing and parameter estimation, where EP-enhanced sensitivity approaches the Heisenberg limit. PT-symmetric systems exhibit similar phase transitions in optical and magnetic systems, where balanced gain-loss profiles enable functionalities like unidirectional invisibility and laser mode selection. The interplay between EPs and PT symmetry is enriched by non-Hermitian topology, requiring redefined bulk-boundary correspondence due to phenomena like the non-Hermitian skin effect [25].

Challenges remain in extending these concepts to many-body systems, where interactions can destabilize EPs and PT-symmetric phases through correlation-induced decoherence. Open questions include classifying higher-order EPs in multiband systems and developing nonlinear frameworks for EP dynamics in driven-dissipative settings. Future research will explore non-Abelian braiding statistics associated with EPs, exhibiting unique topological properties such as nontrivial fundamental groups and eigenvector holonomy. Integrating PT-symmetric photonics with topological quantum computing architectures could leverage robust transport characteristics in non-Hermitian systems, enhancing quantum computing platform stability and functionality [49, 50, 51]. These concepts drive advances in non-Hermitian physics, enabling novel control over wave propagation, topological protection, and quantum measurement precision.

# 4.2 Non-Hermitian Skin Effect and Boundary Localization

The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) redefines boundary localization through unique eigenstate accumulation mechanisms, contrasting with Hermitian systems where bulk-boundary correspondence governs edge state formation. In non-Hermitian lattices, NHSE causes a macroscopic number of eigenmodes to localize exponentially at boundaries, independent of topological invariants under periodic boundary conditions [52]. This breakdown necessitates biorthogonal frameworks for edge state prediction, where left and right eigenvectors are treated independently due to non-orthogonality. The competition between NHSE-induced accumulation and topological edge states is pronounced in higher dimensions, where corner skin modes differ from Hermitian corner states [53].

Two-dimensional non-reciprocal systems show complex interplay between NHSE and topological localization, as seen in honeycomb lattices where skin modes compete with corner states for spectral dominance [54]. This competition leads to mode hybridization and spectral flow anomalies, absent in Hermitian systems. Synthetic dimension approaches reveal further complexity, where engineered boundaries in frequency space create NHSE analogs without physical edges, challenging traditional spatial localization paradigms [55]. The resulting boundary physics is richer than in onedimensional cases, with exceptional edge modes exhibiting hybrid NHSE and topological protection characteristics [56].

Floquet-driven non-Hermitian systems further complicate boundary localization, intertwining NHSE with mixed higher-order topology to produce boundary modes with fractionalized quasienergy spectra [57]. These modes display anomalous properties, including chiral propagation and non-reciprocal scattering, enabled by NHSE’s sensitivity to driving protocols. The boundary localization length becomes frequency-dependent, contrasting with static Hermitian topological insulator scales. Theoretical challenges persist in establishing unified classification schemes reconciling NHSE-induced accumulation with conventional topological protection, especially for systems with non-trivial point-gap topology and higher-order exceptional points.

NHSE’s unique characteristics enrich boundary phenomena understanding and open avenues for practical applications in quantum technologies. Manipulating boundary-localized states in nonHermitian systems can advance photonic devices, sensors, and quantum information systems. By exploiting NHSE, systems can be engineered with robust edge states resistant to disorder and perturbations, enhancing quantum device performance and reliability. This potential underscores the importance of further investigations into the interplay between non-Hermitian effects and boundary localization, paving the way for innovative applications across fields.

# 4.3 Dynamical and Stability Implications

Non-Hermitian systems’ dynamical evolution and stability properties profoundly depart from Hermitian frameworks, especially with boundary phenomena like exceptional points and NHSE. The loss of conventional bulk-boundary correspondence requires new topological invariants to characterize stability and dynamical response [54]. Transient behaviors near exceptional points show enhanced sensitivity to perturbations, with eigenvalue trajectories exhibiting square-root bifurcations amplifying small parameter variations. This nonlinear response underlies quantum sensing applications but introduces fragility in system stability, as minor fluctuations can trigger abrupt phase transitions.

Interactions in many-body non-Hermitian systems complicate stability analysis, potentially destroying exceptional points and spectral phase transitions without breaking underlying symmetries [58]. This interaction-induced reduction in topological classifications challenges non-Hermitian phenomena robustness, particularly in correlated systems where collective effects compete with singleparticle non-Hermitian features. Long-term evolution often converges to non-equilibrium steady states characterized by boundary-localized density profiles, reflecting non-Hermitian topology and dissipative dynamics interplay.

NHSE introduces additional dynamical complexity through its influence on relaxation timescales. Boundary-localized modes exhibit distinct decay rates compared to bulk states, leading to multiexponential relaxation profiles absent in Hermitian systems. This spatial heterogeneity facilitates advanced control over energy dissipation pathways, allowing innovative applications in directed energy transfer and noise suppression, especially through metamaterials governing diffusion processes and leveraging non-Hermitian topology principles to enhance noise immunity in nonlinear optical systems [40, 4]. Stability analysis must consider non-normal non-Hermitian operators, where transient growth can precede asymptotic decay, complicating traditional Lyapunov stability criteria.

Dynamical and stability considerations in non-Hermitian systems impact quantum technologies and materials science applications. Understanding system stability under perturbations is crucial for designing robust quantum devices that withstand environmental fluctuations and maintain coherence. Exploring dynamical phase transitions in non-Hermitian contexts can yield insights into complex systems exhibiting non-equilibrium behaviors, bridging theory and application. Future research should develop generalized stability metrics for non-Hermitian systems incorporating interactions and investigate dynamical phase transitions in driven-dissipative environments. This includes exploring nonlinear extensions of established models, like the Hatano-Nelson model, revealing phenomena like modulational instability and growth blockade, and examining insights enhancing non-Hermitian topology understanding in active matter systems, where unique topological features emerge in nonequilibrium contexts [46, 2]. Integrating non-Markovian effects with non-Hermitian boundary phenomena presents another challenge, especially for quantum information applications requiring long coherence times. These considerations underscore the need for new theoretical tools to predict and control non-Hermitian systems’ evolution across timescales and interaction regimes.

# 5 Non-Hermitian Topology

The exploration of non-Hermitian topology marks a notable departure from traditional Hermitian frameworks, offering new insights into topological phases. This section examines the principles underpinning non-Hermitian systems, focusing on their unique features and implications for topological classification. The following subsection will delve into the foundational aspects of nonHermitian topology, illustrating how these systems challenge conventional notions of symmetry and invariance through complex eigenvalue spectra and non-reciprocal couplings.

# 5.1 Foundations of Non-Hermitian Topology

Non-Hermitian topology introduces a paradigm shift from Hermitian systems by incorporating nonreciprocal couplings, complex band structures, and generalized topological invariants. The complex eigenvalue spectra of non-Hermitian operators allow for topological phases characterized by phenomena such as point gaps and exceptional degeneracies, necessitating a reformulation of topological classifications beyond traditional Bloch band theory [27]. The K-theory framework addresses Wannier localizability and boundary state behavior in these contexts.

Non-reciprocal couplings, a hallmark of non-Hermitian topology, break conventional time-reversal symmetry and enable unidirectional transport properties. Edge polarization in such systems exemplifies the manifestation of non-Hermitian effects in nominally Hermitian settings, particularly through overlap matrix dynamics [25]. The biorthogonal bulk-boundary correspondence is crucial for predicting boundary modes, requiring independent treatment of left and right eigenvectors [17]. This framework enriches our understanding by evaluating non-Hermitian topological invariants on generalized Brillouin zones (GBZ), accounting for complex momentum-space deformations induced by open boundary conditions.

The interplay between non-Hermitian topology and many-body systems adds complexity, as seen in entanglement spectrum crossings in open quantum systems. Homotopy theory provides a classification framework for non-Hermitian band structures, encompassing gapped and nodal systems through symmetry-adapted topological invariants. The hybrid skin-topological effect, where boundarylocalized states coexist with conventional topological edge modes, exemplifies new material platforms for wave control [24]. This universal scaling behavior, characterized by a 3/2 power-law dependence of the Hall conductance, signifies a departure from the quantization observed in Hermitian systems.

The Krein-space formulation of PT symmetry provides a mathematical foundation for understanding pseudo-Hermitian nature in non-Hermitian topological systems, linking it to the CPT inner product and enabling edge mode classification in two-dimensional systems with intrinsic point gap topology. Interaction-induced non-Hermitian topological phases emerge from inter-particle interactions, leading to complex energy spectra in many-body systems. A minimal non-Hermitian model, featuring a one-dimensional chain influenced by a dynamical gauge field dependent on particle density, reveals nontrivial topological characteristics with two or more particles [59, 23]. Information thermodynamic properties are analyzed through Shannon entropy, revealing novel statistical properties absent in Hermitian contexts.

Supersymmetric quantum mechanics offers another perspective on non-Hermitian topology, where complex potentials combined with the Ermakov equation yield real eigenvalues, distinguishing them from generic non-Hermitian systems. The noise immunity in certain non-Hermitian topological phases, particularly in quantum optical systems, arises from topological properties of the noise Hamiltonian, allowing for disorder-resilient noise flow. The foundational concepts expand topological classification beyond Hermitian limitations, facilitating the exploration of phenomena like anomalous point-gap interactions and mirage bath effects, lacking Hermitian counterparts [60, 61].

# 5.2 Symmetry and Classification in Non-Hermitian Systems

Non-Hermitian topological phase classification demands a redefinition of symmetry principles, diverging from Hermitian frameworks through complex spectral topology, non-reciprocal couplings, and generalized symmetry constraints. Unlike Hermitian systems, governed by unitary or antiunitary symmetries, non-Hermitian systems exhibit richer classification schemes based on eigenvalue behaviors in the complex plane and the topological characteristics of exceptional points (EPs) [27]. The pseudo-spectrum is critical for analyzing these phases, particularly in correlated systems where the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) modifies conventional topological indicators. This complexity necessitates new theoretical approaches, as traditional bulk-boundary correspondence fails to predict detachable boundary states whose existence depends on open boundary conditions.

EPs in non-Hermitian systems exhibit spectral topology governed by branch-point singularities in the complex plane. These points serve as organizing centers for non-Hermitian topological phases, influencing the system’s response to perturbations and enabling novel topological phenomena absent in Hermitian systems [60, 62, 49, 61, 51]. The reduction of topological classifications in one-dimensional systems with point gaps highlights the role of correlations in modifying nonHermitian topology, where many-body interactions can collapse symmetry-protected phases, contrasting sharply with Hermitian systems where interactions typically preserve or enrich topological classifications.

Relaxation dynamics in driven-dissipative quantum systems reveal how non-Hermitian symmetries alter statistical mechanics, as described by the PT-symmetric generalized Gibbs ensemble (PTGGE) [35]. This framework generalizes equilibrium statistical mechanics to account for noncanonical statistics in non-Hermitian systems, illuminating how PT symmetry constraints modify phase space distributions. The interplay between non-Hermitian topology and dynamical systems uncovers unexpected connections to evolutionary processes, where topological invariants govern stability and pattern formation in non-equilibrium settings.

Observing genuine non-Hermitian topological phases in quantum systems is experimentally challenging due to monitoring and measurement backaction complicating the isolation of non-Hermitian effects. Multi-terminal quantum Hall setups provide an effective platform for investigating nonHermitian topological phases without gain-loss mechanism complications. These systems leverage the nonreciprocity of quantum Hall edge states to reveal robust topological properties, akin to Hermitian counterparts. Recent studies show such setups can exhibit a non-Hermitian skin effect, characterized by exponential profiles of currents and voltages, stable even during Hall plateau transitions. The tunability of these systems, particularly in materials like graphene, allows exploration of nonHermitian topological phase transitions and manipulation of topological invariants through external parameters such as magnetic fields and gate voltages [63, 50, 51].

The interplay between non-Hermitian topology and dynamical systems reveals connections to evolutionary processes, where topological invariants govern stability and pattern formation in nonequilibrium settings. Radiation-free topological modes in magnonic systems exemplify this connection, with point defects creating localized states robust against radiative losses through inertial effects. These perspectives enrich non-Hermitian systems’ symmetry classification, suggesting topological protection may arise from non-Hermitian constraints on information flow rather than static symmetry conditions. Future research should focus on creating unified frameworks for classifying higher-dimensional non-Hermitian topological phases, particularly in light of recent findings demonstrating non-Hermitian topological invariants in multi-terminal conductance matrices, leading to novel phase transitions in systems like monolayer graphene. Additionally, exploring measurementinduced topology in monitored quantum circuits could reveal new insights into the interplay between boundary states and bulk properties in Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems, enhancing understanding of topologically-protected transport phenomena [51, 62].

# 5.3 Bulk-Boundary Correspondence and Topological Invariants

Bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems deviates significantly from Hermitian paradigms, necessitating reformulated topological invariants and alternative frameworks to characterize boundary phenomena. Traditional Bloch band theory fails in non-Hermitian contexts due to the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where eigenstates localize exponentially at boundaries irrespective of bulk topological properties [25]. This breakdown necessitates biorthogonal formulations of bulk-boundary correspondence, where left and right eigenvectors are treated independently to predict boundary modes accurately. The topology of the Liouvillian superoperator is characterized by a Chern number, indicating the number of topological end modes and providing a measurable signature of non-Hermitian topology [27].

Non-Bloch topological invariants are essential for maintaining bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems, computed via complex momentum-space deformations that account for open boundary conditions. The proof involves deriving the Hamiltonian and demonstrating eigenstate coalescence at exceptional points, predicting Weyl points and fractional quantum numbers. In monitored quantum systems, direct access to steady-state biorthogonal expectation values of observables provides measurable signatures of non-Hermitian topology. Non-Hermitian frameworks reveal exceptional points and skin effects that significantly alter population dynamics and transport properties [64].

The interplay between quantum coherence and topological quantization is pronounced in dissipative systems, where lasing edge modes emerge in robust topological phases. Non-Hermitian phases in the conductance matrix demonstrate robustness and tunability via chemical potential adjustments, suggesting device geometry and quality are crucial for realizing non-Hermitian topological transport. Multiterminal Josephson junctions exemplify this behavior, realizing non-Hermitian topology and exceptional points that enhance quantum transport applications [23].

Pseudo-Hermitian topology offers an alternative classification scheme, where non-trivial topological classifications can exist without exceptional points through pseudo-Hermitian lines. This unified interpretation links non-Hermitian topology to quantum anomalies and skin effects, offering new insights into boundary phenomena [25]. The Generalized Inversion Symmetry (GIS) method defines conditions under which the rigidity matrix of a mechanical lattice is real for real wavenumbers, allowing for topological phase classification in hyperstatic systems [65]. Future directions include developing experimental protocols for directly observing non-Hermitian topological invariants in solid-state systems, overcoming current challenges in implementing non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. These advances collectively redefine topological classification for non-Hermitian systems, establishing new paradigms for predicting and engineering boundary phenomena in open quantum systems.

# 6 Applications in Open Quantum Systems

In open quantum systems, the integration of non-Hermitian effects with quantum sensing has emerged as a promising avenue for enhancing measurement precision and sensitivity. This section explores the role of exceptional points (EPs) in these systems, emphasizing their potential to exceed traditional sensitivity limits in quantum measurements. The discussion focuses on how EPs contribute to advancements in quantum sensing technologies, underscoring their implications for experimental applications. Leveraging non-Hermitian phenomena to achieve unprecedented measurement accuracy could revolutionize fields such as fundamental physics, material science, and medical diagnostics. By examining the foundational principles and recent advancements, the transformative potential of EPs in quantum technologies becomes evident.

# 6.1 Quantum Sensing and Exceptional Points

Exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian systems serve as powerful tools for quantum sensing, utilizing their spectral properties to surpass conventional Hermitian sensitivity limits. Their enhanced sensitivity arises from the square-root scaling of eigenvalue splittings with perturbations near EPs, contrasting with the linear response of Hermitian degeneracies. This nonlinear scaling allows parameter estimation nearing the Heisenberg limit, as shown in Josephson junction arrays where EP-based sensors significantly improve phase sensitivity [19]. Implementing these sensors necessitates precise gain-loss balance and non-reciprocal couplings, with recent photonic and superconducting circuit advancements providing viable platforms. These improvements enhance quantum sensor performance, paving the way for applications in communications and environmental monitoring.

The bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems is crucial for EP-enhanced sensing, as boundary-localized states show amplified responses to perturbations [17]. This effect is evident in systems with the non-Hermitian skin effect, where eigenstate boundary accumulation creates natural amplification zones for sensing. Geometric phase contributions near EPs further boost signal-tonoise ratios through adiabatic amplification, enabling weak signal detection in noisy environments. Experimental realizations in optomechanical systems illustrate how synthetic gauge fields dynamically tune EP configurations, optimizing sensor performance for specific tasks. These developments highlight the importance of understanding EP physics to fully exploit their potential in practical sensing applications.

Buoyancy-driven systems reveal unexpected EP connections to convective instabilities, with exceptional rings forming in rotating fluid parameter spaces [20]. These structures suggest applications in astrophysical sensing, where EP-mediated sensitivity could probe internal stellar dynamics and protostellar convection patterns. The interplay between exceptional rings and wave propagation in convective regions offers new avenues for developing non-invasive diagnostic tools in extreme environments, expanding the scope of quantum sensing applications.

Advancements in quantum optical implementations of EP-based sensors demonstrate remarkable noise immunity, maintaining sensitivity amid environmental fluctuations and fabrication imperfections. This robustness stems from EPs’ topological protection, preserving sensor performance despite parameter variations. The advancement of Floquet protocols for engineered EPs in atomic systems has broadened the spectrum of measurable phenomena, facilitating precise detection of weak magnetic fields and sub-wavelength displacements. This progress leverages non-Hermitian topology and synthetic dimensions, enabling boundary creation that enhances sensor performance and sensitivity. Integrating these concepts has shown exponential sensitivity improvements in sensor networks, opening new avenues for classical and quantum information processing applications [55, 66]. These advances underscore the transformative potential of non-Hermitian physics in redefining quantum metrology limits, with applications spanning fundamental physics to medical imaging and gravitational wave detection.

# 6.2 Non-Hermitian Topology in Quantum Information

Non-Hermitian topology offers transformative potential for quantum information processing by leveraging boundary-localized states, exceptional points, and non-reciprocal couplings to enhance error correction and state manipulation protocols. The topological initialization of qubits in monitored quantum circuits demonstrates how non-Hermitian effects can stabilize quantum states against decoherence [18]. These circuits effectively realize non-Hermitian topological phases through measurement-induced dynamics, enabling observation of topological phase transitions without requiring physical gain-loss mechanisms [67]. The universal scaling behavior of Hall conductance in non-Hermitian systems further suggests robust transport properties that could be harnessed for faulttolerant quantum communication [24]. By investigating these properties, researchers can develop more reliable and efficient quantum information protocols.

Graphene-based quantum Hall devices provide a promising platform for implementing nonHermitian topological quantum information protocols, where edge states exhibit enhanced robustness against disorder when coupled to engineered environments [63]. The solid-state realization of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond demonstrates the feasibility of observing non-Hermitian topological properties in quantum simulators [68]. These implementations enable precise control over non-reciprocal couplings and gain-loss profiles, essential for developing topological quantum gates and error correction schemes. Such advancements not only provide a deeper understanding of non-Hermitian phenomena but also facilitate the design of more robust quantum technologies.

The interplay between non-Hermitian topology and quantum measurement introduces novel paradigms for state manipulation, where exceptional points can amplify weak measurement signals while protecting quantum information from backaction-induced errors. The non-Hermitian skin effect enhances the robustness of quantum states by localizing them at the boundaries of nonHermitian systems, which acts to shield these states from decoherence processes occurring in the bulk. This phenomenon is characterized by the emergence of a significant number of boundary modes under open boundary conditions, and it is fundamentally linked to the system’s intrinsic non-Hermitian topology. Additionally, higher-order skin effects can give rise to distinct boundary physics, such as corner skin modes in two-dimensional systems, further contributing to the isolation of quantum states from bulk interactions [25, 53, 69, 29]. These mechanisms suggest potential applications in topological quantum memory, where boundary-localized states could serve as naturally protected qubit encodings, thus enhancing the reliability of quantum information storage.

Future research directions include the integration of non-Hermitian topological phases with existing quantum computing architectures, particularly in hybrid systems combining superconducting qubits with topological materials. The development of measurement protocols that exploit the enhanced sensitivity near exceptional points could revolutionize quantum state tomography and parameter estimation. Theoretical challenges persist in comprehensively understanding the stability of non-Hermitian topological phases when subjected to many-body interactions, as well as in formulating quantitative metrics for assessing topological protection in open quantum systems. These challenges are underscored by the complex interplay between non-Hermitian topology and traditional Hermitian systems, where phenomena such as the emergence of anomalous boundary states, non-Hermitian phase transitions, and the dynamics of entanglement and quantum anomalies play crucial roles. Moreover, the exploration of non-Hermitian topological features in platforms like graphene and their implications for robust transport characteristics further complicates the theoretical landscape, necessitating deeper insights into the connections between topological invariants and system stability in the presence of dissipation and interaction effects [70, 29, 51, 62]. These advances promise to establish non-Hermitian topology as a fundamental tool for quantum information processing, complementing existing Hermitian-based approaches.

# 6.3 Dissipation and Open System Dynamics

Dissipation in open quantum systems fundamentally alters dynamical evolution through non-unitary interactions with external environments, necessitating non-Hermitian frameworks for accurate description and control. The anomalous point-gap interactions revealed in non-Hermitian systems demonstrate how spectral topology governs bath-mediated dynamics, where mirage bath effects create interaction channels absent in Hermitian systems [71]. These topological interactions manifest in critical non-Hermitian systems through Heisenberg-limited sensitivity to Hamiltonian parameters, directly resulting from point-gap closing phenomena [72]. The evaluation of dissipative effects in Lindblad systems employs energy current and fidelity metrics, quantifying power transfer efficiency while revealing non-Markovian memory effects [73]. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing robust quantum technologies that can operate effectively in real-world environments.

The biorthogonal bulk-boundary correspondence provides a theoretical foundation for understanding dissipation-induced edge phenomena, where non-Hermitian skin effects modify conventional localization paradigms [52]. Higher-dimensional extensions of these concepts demonstrate edgeselective extremal damping in topological insulators, enabling engineered dissipation landscapes through chiral edge modes [74]. Synthetic dimension approaches further enrich this framework by creating effective boundaries in frequency space, allowing dissipation control without physical edges [55]. The persistence of exceptional points and skin effects under nonlinear eigenvalue constraints confirms their robustness in dissipative quantum systems [75]. These insights into dissipation dynamics are vital for the development of new strategies that enhance quantum coherence and information retention.

Non-Markovian dynamics introduce additional complexity, requiring advanced measures for quantifying information backflow and memory effects in open quantum systems [42]. Matrix algebra formulations of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics provide computational tools for simulating these dynamics, particularly in systems with strong dissipation-environment coupling [76]. The higherorder non-Hermitian skin effect demonstrates how boundary conditions influence dissipation pathways, with numerical simulations revealing complex spectral signatures under open boundary conditions [53]. These findings emphasize the necessity of developing theoretical frameworks that account for the intricate interactions between quantum systems and their environments.

Future research directions should focus on developing comprehensive measures of nonMarkovianity tailored for high-dimensional quantum systems, which account for the intricate memory effects arising from system-environment interactions. Additionally, there is a need to explore the integration of dissipation engineering with topological protection schemes, particularly in the context of Chern insulators, to create robust, spatially localized damping patterns that leverage nonHermitian topological features for enhanced control over quantum dynamics [69, 74, 51, 42]. The interplay between synthetic dimensions and dissipative dynamics presents promising avenues for controlling quantum information flow, while the exploration of nonlinear exceptional points could enable new paradigms for robust quantum sensing in noisy environments. These advances collectively establish non-Hermitian physics as an indispensable framework for understanding and harnessing dissipation in open quantum systems.

This section outlines the theoretical and experimental obstacles currently impeding progress, focusing on limitations in spectral topology, many-body systems, and practical implementations. By identifying these challenges, researchers can develop strategies to overcome them, paving the way for significant advancements in the field.

# 7.1 Current Challenges in Non-Hermitian Physics

Non-Hermitian physics faces significant theoretical and experimental challenges, particularly in spectral topology and many-body systems. A key theoretical challenge is the fragility of exceptional points under interactions, complicating the generalization of topological classifications beyond idealized models [17]. This fragility raises questions about the stability of non-Hermitian phases when subjected to perturbations, necessitating a deeper understanding of their behavior in complex systems. The complexity of non-Hermitian spectral theory, especially in treating the nonHermitian skin effect, presents barriers for theoretical analysis and experimental verification. The nonuniqueness of critical symmetry operators in unbounded systems adds ambiguity in classifying non-Hermitian topological phases [15].

Experimentally, controlling gain-loss balance and nonlinear effects poses substantial hurdles. The universal scaling behavior of Hall conductance in non-Hermitian systems is limited to specific conditions, with exceptional points having less influence on transport properties than anticipated [24]. Achieving precise gain-loss balance is challenging, affecting the practical applicability of non-Hermitian effects. Methods for realizing soft topological modes face limitations in guaranteeing localized states across all configurations, especially when symmetry conditions are not strictly met [65]. These challenges are compounded by the need for high-resolution simulations to confirm theoretical predictions, particularly in nonlinear regimes relevant to stellar environments [20].

Methodological constraints in analyzing bulk-boundary correspondence also pose challenges, with current frameworks struggling to capture classical wave behavior in non-ideal or highly dispersive media [30]. The focus on one-dimensional models limits the ability to address complexities in higher-dimensional non-Hermitian systems [23]. Addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary collaborations and novel computational and experimental techniques to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

# 7.2 Theoretical and Computational Advancements

Emerging theoretical and computational tools are poised to address challenges in non-Hermitian physics through machine learning, optimization techniques, and novel numerical methods. Machine learning approaches, such as convolutional neural networks, show potential for predicting non-Hermitian topological invariants with high accuracy, overcoming limitations in analytical calculations [44]. These methods enable rapid classification of complex spectral topologies and exceptional point configurations. Artificial intelligence applied to diffusion metamaterial design exemplifies this trend, where optimization algorithms explore non-Hermitian parameter spaces for desired wave control functionalities [4].

Advanced numerical frameworks are being developed to address the complexity of non-Bloch topological invariants in higher dimensions, filling gaps in current classification schemes [41]. The extension of matrix optimal transport theory to quantum networks provides a promising avenue for analyzing non-Hermitian dynamics in many-body systems, using the matricial Wasserstein metric to quantify state transformations under dissipative evolution [45]. These methods enable precise characterization of topological phase transitions in open quantum systems, where traditional Bloch theory fails due to the non-Hermitian skin effect and complex spectral winding.

Time-local unraveling techniques for non-Markovian stochastic Schrödinger equations offer tools for simulating open system dynamics, particularly in structured environments with memory effects [32]. These advances complement efforts to reconcile energy conservation paradoxes in nonHermitian quantum mechanics, where new frameworks are needed to unify local conservation laws with non-unitary evolution [13]. Extending non-Hermitian topological invariants to more complex systems, including those with higher-order exceptional points and synthetic dimensions, is a critical direction for future research [77]. These advancements promise to enhance our understanding of non-Hermitian phenomena and facilitate the exploration of new physical regimes.

In quantum computing, non-Hermitian topological phases provide pathways for robust qubit encoding through boundary-localized states, leveraging the non-Hermitian skin effect to isolate information from bulk decoherence. The universal scaling behavior of Hall conductance suggests new approaches to topological protection, though future investigations should explore the implications of different coupling strengths and configurations [24]. K-theory classification of Wannier localizability offers a framework for identifying topological phases suitable for fault-tolerant quantum memory.

Quantum communication systems benefit from non-reciprocal couplings and exceptional pointenhanced sensitivity, enabling directional information transfer and noise-resilient protocols. The relaxation dynamics in PT-symmetric generalized Gibbs ensembles suggest novel approaches to quantum state transfer, with further exploration needed in complex interacting systems. The Schrödinger formalism applied to classical electromagnetism facilitates the integration of non-Hermitian effects into photonic systems, extending to complex media and addressing nonlinear effects [30]. Recent advancements in non-Hermitian topology and noise management in nonlinear optical systems suggest promising avenues for enhancing communication system performance [78, 76, 40, 12].

Quantum sensing applications utilize exceptional points and anomalous point-gap interactions to achieve Heisenberg-limited precision, particularly in critical non-Hermitian systems where topological features induce heightened sensitivity near spectral degeneracies. Non-Hermitian topological sensors demonstrate that the interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology can exponentially increase sensitivity, especially in networks of coupled sensors [60, 66, 72]. Observations of nonHermitian topology in non-unitary systems suggest promising directions for improving environmental coupling engineering and enhancing experimental techniques. Buoyancy-driven systems reveal exceptional rings that could inspire novel sensing modalities in astrophysical environments, with studies needed to quantify rotational and gravitational effects.

Theoretical advancements in non-Hermitian flat-band systems underscore the importance of developing generalized frameworks for modeling non-Hermitian effects in quantum technologies. The decimation scheme applied to non-Hermitian flat bands provides a tool for analyzing critical phenomena, with future research exploring extensions to higher dimensions and dislocation-induced effects. Large deviations in trajectory observables enhance understanding of non-Hermitian systems, offering insights into statistical properties under various boundary conditions [9]. Machine learning techniques in identifying topological invariants show potential for accurately predicting eigenvalue winding and exploring associated topological phase transitions [44].

The dynamical properties of non-Hermitian systems, such as modulational instability and growth blockade, offer opportunities for advancements in quantum technology while posing challenges due to complex behaviors. The nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model shows how modulational instability can lead to localized nonlinear skin modes and solitons, influencing directional transport and non-Hermitian topology [60, 46]. Exploring other nonlinear non-Hermitian systems could uncover additional dynamical phenomena, expanding understanding of instability mechanisms in quantum devices. These diverse applications position non-Hermitian physics as a cornerstone for next-generation quantum technologies, provided challenges in stability, scalability, and theoretical consistency are addressed.
