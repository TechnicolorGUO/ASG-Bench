Unlike Hermitian systems constrained by unitarity and real spectra, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians exhibit complex eigenvalues and non-orthogonal eigenstates, enabling phenomena such as exceptional points (EPs), the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), and unconventional topological phases. These features arise from the failure of traditional bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems, primarily due to the non-Bloch-wave behavior of eigenstates, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect.

For instance, the interplay between non-Hermiticity and symmetry leads to novel phenomena such as the hinge NHSE and magnetic-field-induced topological transitions in Kitaev models. Non-Hermitian pumping in quantum gases introduces intrinsic nonlocality, manifesting as kinks in wave packet trajectories [6], while multiterminal superconducting junctions exhibit robust topological characteristics at exceptional points [7]. The topological characterization of non-Hermitian ladder systems further highlights the role of periodic driving in generating nontrivial phases [8].\n\nExperimental realizations span photonic lattices, ultracold atoms, and optomechanical systems, demonstrating phenomena such as chirality-induced spin selectivity and non-reciprocal transport of exciton-polaritons. Topological mode-locked lasers exemplify the transition from spectral to topological mode-locking, with applications in ultrafast optics and quantum technologies [9]. The study of twisted topology in bipolar non-Hermitian systems reveals unique properties that extend beyond traditional Hermitian frameworks [10].

The interplay between EPs and PT-symmetry breaking gives rise to anomalous nodal-line semimetals and other exotic spectral features [20], while quasistationary solutions in long lattices with open boundary conditions illustrate their unique dynamical properties [14]. The universal spectral moment theorem provides a robust framework for understanding EPs independent of microscopic details [11].\n\nThe non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) manifests as boundary-localized eigenstates, arising from non-reciprocal hopping and complex-spectral topology [21]. Twisted topology in bipolar nonHermitian systems further enriches the NHSE, with long-range unidirectional coupling leading to unconventional eigenspectra [10]. The NHSE’s interplay with multiple asymmetric couplings in topolectrical circuits results in unconventional node voltage accumulation [22]. Recent advances reveal its robustness in topological end states under non-equilibrium conditions [23], while sizedependent boundary effects are experimentally observed under varying lattice configurations [24]. The hinge NHSE emerges in strongly interacting systems, exhibiting single-particle properties sensitive to boundary conditions [25], and scale-tailored localization (STL) provides a novel mechanism for controlling wave localization through long-range asymmetric coupling [26].\n\nTopological phases in non-Hermitian systems are governed by complex-valued invariants and revised bulk-boundary correspondence [5]. Topologically bound states emerge from the interaction of distinguishable particles, forming complex correlated states and interaction-induced flat bands [15]. The bosonic Kitaev chain exhibits striking non-Hermitian features, including chiral transport and sensitivity to boundary conditions [27]. Topology-induced spontaneous non-reciprocal pumping in cold-atom systems highlights the interplay between topological properties and non-Hermitian effects [18]. The topological field theory for non-Hermitian systems provides a foundation for understanding unique phases lacking Hermitian analogs [28], while the interplay between NHSE and topology in higher-dimensional systems remains an active area of research [29].\n\nExperimental realizations of these phenomena span diverse platforms. Topological temporal modelocking in lasers introduces and controls topology in the temporal domain of laser modes, expanding the capabilities of mode-locked lasers [9]. The role of exceptional rings in buoyancy instabilities extends the applicability of non-Hermitian physics to astrophysical contexts [17]. Theoretical challenges include unifying these phenomena under a coherent framework, particularly in systems with non-local feedback or curved spacetime analogs. Future directions involve exploring higherorder skin effects, nonlinear interactions, and the integration of many-body correlations into nonHermitian topological phases.\n\nThe exploration of these key phenomena in non-Hermitian systems not only enhances our understanding of quantum mechanics but also paves the way for innovative applications in quantum technologies, materials science, and beyond.

This comprehensive review underscores the importance of continued engagement in nonHermitian research across the scientific community, emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration to harness its full potential. Through continued inquiry, non-Hermitian principles promise transformative impacts across theoretical and applied sciences, heralding new technological frontiers."
