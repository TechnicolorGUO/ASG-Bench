      "content": "The study of non-Hermitian topological invariants has emerged as a critical frontier in understanding the behavior of open quantum systems, where dissipation and gain play essential roles. Unlike traditional Hermitian systems, which are governed by unitary dynamics and conserve probability, non-Hermitian systems allow for the exchange of energy with their environment, leading to complex eigenvalue spectra and novel topological phenomena. This shift necessitates a reevaluation of conventional topological classifications, as non-Hermiticity introduces new symmetry constraints and modifies the bulk-boundary correspondence [2]. Recent theoretical frameworks have demonstrated that non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can be classified using generalized versions of K-theory, expanding the Altland-Zirnbauer classification to include 38 symmetry classes instead of the original 10, thereby capturing intrinsic non-Hermitian topological phases [3]. These developments underscore the importance of symmetry-based approaches in characterizing the topology of open systems, particularly when pseudo-Hermiticity or other non-unitary symmetries are present.\n\nA central challenge in non-Hermitian topological physics is the breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence, which fails to predict boundary states accurately due to the emergence of the non-Hermitian skin effect—where eigenstates localize at system boundaries rather than being distributed throughout the bulk [4]. This phenomenon necessitates the development of new topological invariants that account for the non-Bloch nature of the generalized Brillouin zone. For instance, the non-Bloch winding number has been shown to correctly characterize the zero modes of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, demonstrating the necessity of redefining topological invariants in non-Hermitian systems [5]. Additionally, biorthogonal quantum mechanics provides a framework for understanding the interplay between left and right eigenstates, revealing that their combined density governs phase transitions and the emergence of topological edge states [5]. These insights highlight the need for a unified theoretical approach that integrates both the spectral properties of non-Hermitian systems and their topological characteristics, offering a more comprehensive description of open quantum systems.\n\nThe implications of non-Hermitian topological invariants extend beyond fundamental theory, influencing practical applications in photonics, condensed matter, and quantum information science. For example, the presence of exceptional points—where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce—enables enhanced sensitivity in sensing devices and robust unidirectional propagation in photonic systems [6]. Moreover, the discovery of symmetry-protected lasers and dissipative superconductors illustrates how non-Hermitian topology can give rise to novel functionalities in engineered materials [7]. However, several challenges remain, including the precise characterization of topological invariants in high-dimensional systems and the experimental verification of predicted phenomena such as anomalous bulk-boundary correspondence [8]. Future research should focus on developing scalable numerical methods for computing non-Hermitian invariants, exploring the interplay between topology and nonlinearity in open systems, and investigating the role of disorder in stabilizing or disrupting non-Hermitian topological phases [9]. Such efforts will not only deepen our understanding of open quantum systems but also pave the way for the design of next-generation topological devices with unprecedented control over light, electrons, and other quantum degrees of freedom."

      "content": "Non-Hermitian topological invariants represent a critical advancement in the understanding of topological phases, particularly in systems where conventional Hermitian frameworks fail to capture essential physical behaviors. Unlike traditional topological invariants, which rely on the spectral properties of Hermitian Hamiltonians, non-Hermitian systems introduce complex energy spectra and exceptional points—where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce—necessitating new theoretical constructs [5]. These invariants are often defined through generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) formalisms, which account for the \"non-Hermitian skin effect,\" a phenomenon where eigenstates localize at system boundaries rather than being distributed uniformly [1]. This deviation from the standard bulk-boundary correspondence fundamentally alters the classification of topological phases, as seen in extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models, where zero modes are determined by non-Bloch winding numbers instead of conventional Bloch-Hamiltonian-based invariants [1]. The emergence of such invariants underscores the necessity of redefining topological classifications in non-Hermitian contexts, particularly in systems with open boundary conditions or dissipation.\n\nThe breakdown of conventional topological invariants in open quantum systems is closely tied to the interplay between non-Hermiticity and symmetry. In Hermitian systems, topological protection arises from symmetries such as time-reversal, particle-hole, and chiral symmetry, which ensure the robustness of edge states against perturbations. However, in non-Hermitian systems, these symmetries are either modified or lost, leading to the emergence of new topological phases that cannot be captured by existing classifications [5]. For instance, non-Hermiticity can lead to the breaking of the bulk-boundary correspondence, where the presence of boundary states no longer correlates with the topological invariant of the bulk [5]. Additionally, the complex nature of energy spectra introduces two distinct types of gaps—point-like and line-like—which further complicate the definition of topological invariants [5]. These challenges highlight the limitations of extending Hermitian topological concepts directly to open systems and emphasize the need for a more comprehensive framework that incorporates non-Hermitian effects.\n\nDespite these challenges, recent advances have begun to address the complexities of non-Hermitian topological invariants through novel theoretical approaches. One promising direction involves the use of biorthogonal quantum mechanics, which accounts for the distinct left and right eigenstates of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians [5]. This approach enables the formulation of generalized bulk-boundary correspondences, where the quantized polarization is derived directly from open boundary conditions rather than periodic ones. Furthermore, the application of K-theory to classify non-Hermitian topological phases has revealed a richer structure, with 38 symmetry classes instead of the 10 found in Hermitian systems [5]. These developments suggest that non-Hermitian topology is not merely an extension of its Hermitian counterpart but a fundamentally different paradigm."

      "content": "The current research status on non-Hermitian topological invariants reveals a rapidly evolving field that challenges conventional understanding of topological phases while introducing novel theoretical frameworks and experimental opportunities. Central to this research is the redefinition of topological invariants in non-Hermitian systems, which exhibit unique properties such as the non-Hermitian skin effect and complex energy spectra [2]. These phenomena necessitate a departure from traditional Bloch theory, as the bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems often fails to align with the predictions of standard topological invariants. For instance, the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model under non-Hermitian conditions demonstrates zero modes determined by a non-Bloch winding number rather than the conventional Bloch-Hamiltonian-based invariant [2]. This highlights the need for generalized Brillouin zones and new mathematical tools to characterize topological phases in non-Hermitian settings.\n\nA significant advancement in the field is the development of a coherent framework for classifying non-Hermitian topological phases, which incorporates both symmetry and topology. This work extends the Altland-Zirnbauer classification by accounting for the distinct roles of charge conjugation, chiral symmetry, and sublattice symmetry in non-Hermitian systems [1]. The introduction of pseudo-Hermiticity as an additional symmetry expands the number of symmetry classes from 10 to 38, enabling the description of intrinsic non-Hermitian topological phases and random matrices. Furthermore, the identification of Z2 indices in arbitrary channels provides a robust foundation for characterizing topological phases in non-Hermitian systems. This framework not only categorizes recently observed lasing and transport phenomena but also predicts new types of symmetry-protected lasers, helical edge states, and dissipative superconductors [1].\n\nDespite these advances, several challenges remain in the study of non-Hermitian topological invariants. The complex nature of energy spectra in non-Hermitian systems introduces two distinct types of complex-energy gaps—point-like and line-like—which complicate the classification of gapped systems [1]. Additionally, the biorthogonal bulk-boundary correspondence, which accounts for the interplay between left and right eigenstates, remains an active area of investigation [5]. This framework has been shown to resolve discrepancies in the traditional bulk-boundary correspondence, particularly in systems where the non-Hermitian skin effect leads to the emergence of infinite (quasi-)edge modes [6]. However, the practical implementation of these concepts in experimental platforms, such as photonic crystals and electrical circuits, requires further exploration. Future research should focus on developing scalable methods for measuring non-Hermitian topological invariants, integrating them with existing topological classification schemes, and exploring their implications for quantum information processing and novel material design."

These developments challenge established paradigms, particularly the bulk-boundary correspondence, and introduce novel concepts such as the non-Hermitian skin effect and biorthogonal quantum mechanics [2]. Unlike Hermitian systems, where topological invariants are typically defined using Bloch wavefunctions, non-Hermitian systems require a redefinition of these invariants within a generalized Brillouin zone. This shift is exemplified by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, where zero modes are determined by a non-Bloch winding number rather than traditional Bloch-Hamiltonian-based invariants [2]. Such findings underscore the necessity of revisiting foundational topological principles in non-Hermitian contexts.\n\nThe classification of topological phases in non-Hermitian systems has also seen substantial progress, with researchers developing frameworks that incorporate symmetry considerations and K-theory to systematically categorize these phases across dimensions [6]. Notably, non-Hermiticity introduces new symmetry classes beyond the tenfold way of Hermitian systems, expanding the total number of symmetry classes to 38 when pseudo-Hermiticity and other constraints are considered [1]. This expansion reveals the existence of intrinsic non-Hermitian topological phases, which exhibit unique properties such as Z2 indices for arbitrary channels. Furthermore, the complex nature of energy spectra in non-Hermitian systems leads to distinct types of complex-energy gaps—point-like and line-like—which further complicate the classification process.

This framework accounts for the interplay between left and right eigenstates, revealing that their combined density precisely captures phase transitions. This approach addresses the failure of traditional bulk-boundary correspondence in predicting boundary states, especially in scenarios where phase transitions occur at parameter values far from those corresponding to gap closings. Additionally, the role of exceptional points—where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce—has emerged as a central feature of non-Hermitian topology, leading to phenomena such as nodal topological phases with open Fermi-Seifert surfaces [5]. These findings suggest that non-Hermitian systems offer a broader and more nuanced landscape for exploring topological phenomena, with implications for both fundamental physics and potential applications in photonic and electronic devices."
