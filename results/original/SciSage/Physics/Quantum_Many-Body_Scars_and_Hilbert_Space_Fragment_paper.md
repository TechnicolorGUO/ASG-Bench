# Paper on Quantum Many-Body Scars and Hilbert Space Fragmentation


## Abstract

This paper investigates the phenomenon of quantum many-body scars and their role in Hilbert space fragmentation, aiming to deepen understanding of non-thermal dynamics in isolated quantum systems. The study addresses the challenge of how certain eigenstates, known as many-body scars, resist thermalization and persist as stable, long-lived states despite interactions. By analyzing model systems with specific symmetry constraints, the research explores the interplay between integrability, disorder, and the emergence of fragmented Hilbert spaces. The methodology combines numerical exact diagonalization, time-evolution simulations, and analytical techniques rooted in quantum many-body theory. Key findings reveal that scarred states are not randomly distributed but form structured subspaces within the full Hilbert space, significantly altering the system's relaxation dynamics. These results contribute to the broader discussion on the breakdown of ergodicity in quantum systems and offer insights into the design of robust quantum states for information processing. The implications extend to quantum computing, where controlling Hilbert space structure could enhance coherence and stability. This work underscores the importance of identifying and characterizing non-thermal states in complex quantum systems, providing a foundation for future experimental and theoretical studies.


## Introduction

The study of quantum many-body systems has revealed fascinating phenomena that challenge our understanding of thermalization and ergodicity in isolated quantum systems. Among these, quantum many-body scars—localized, non-thermal eigenstates that persist in otherwise chaotic systems—have emerged as a key area of interest, offering new insights into the breakdown of typical quantum dynamics. Concurrently, the concept of Hilbert space fragmentation, where the available state space is partitioned into dynamically disconnected subspaces, has gained prominence in explaining the anomalous relaxation behavior observed in certain strongly correlated systems. This introduction explores the interplay between these two concepts, highlighting their significance in reshaping our comprehension of quantum coherence and information spreading. By examining the underlying mechanisms and implications, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how these phenomena contribute to the broader landscape of quantum many-body physics. The discussion sets the stage for a deeper analysis of their theoretical foundations and experimental relevance.

### Research Motivation and Open Questions

The study of quantum many-body scars (QMBs) and Hilbert space fragmentation has emerged as a critical frontier in understanding non-thermal dynamics and ergodicity breaking in isolated quantum systems. These phenomena challenge conventional notions of thermalization, offering new insights into the interplay between conservation laws, entanglement, and nonequilibrium behavior. The research is motivated by both theoretical curiosity and experimental advances, particularly in cold atom and Rydberg atom systems, where QMBs have been observed through revivals and long-lived oscillations [5][8]. Additionally, Hilbert space fragmentation—where the Hilbert space splits into dynamically disconnected subsectors—has been linked to disorder-free localization and fractonic behavior, raising questions about the universality of such effects across different model classes [6][13].

A central motivation for studying QMBs and Hilbert space fragmentation lies in their potential to reveal novel dynamical regimes that defy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). QMBs are characterized by non-ergodic eigenstates with subthermal entanglement entropy and anomalous thermalization timescales, often arising from symmetry constraints or specific interactions [8][11]. For instance, the Rydberg-blockaded atom chain provides a platform where exact matrix product state (MPS) representations of scar states have been identified, demonstrating violations of ETH at infinite temperature [11]. Similarly, dipole-conserving Hamiltonians exhibit extensive Hilbert space fragmentation, leading to non-thermal behavior even in the absence of disorder [2][13]. These findings highlight how conservation laws can fundamentally alter the structure of the Hilbert space, creating regions where thermalization is suppressed or delayed.

Despite significant progress, several open questions remain. First, the stability of QMBs under perturbations is not fully understood. While some studies show robustness to certain types of noise or interactions, others indicate that perturbations compatible with the underlying quasiparticle picture can restore thermalization [8]. Second, the relationship between QMBs and other forms of non-ergodicity—such as many-body localization (MBL) or fractonic behavior—requires further clarification. Although both MBL and QMBs involve slow or absent thermalization, they arise from distinct mechanisms: MBL from disorder, while QMBs stem from symmetries or conservation laws [6][15]. Third, the role of Hilbert space fragmentation in higher dimensions remains an active area of investigation. While some models exhibit such fragmentation in arbitrary spatial dimensions, the conditions under which it persists in interacting systems are still debated [4][13]. Finally, the development of efficient numerical methods to characterize and simulate these phenomena—such as matrix product states or variational neural networks—remains a key challenge [16]. Future work should focus on bridging theoretical predictions with experimental observations, particularly in ultracold atom platforms, and exploring the implications of these phenomena for quantum information processing and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.

### Background and Overview of Quantum Many-Body Scars and Hilbert Space Fragmentation

Quantum many-body scars (QMBs) and Hilbert space fragmentation are phenomena that challenge the conventional understanding of thermalization in isolated quantum systems. These concepts have been explored through experimental realizations in Rydberg atom simulators and theoretical investigations into integrable and non-integrable models, offering insights into non-ergodic dynamics and the breakdown of eigenstate thermalization [2]. QMBs are defined by stable, non-thermal eigenstates that exhibit revivals and persistent oscillations, while Hilbert space fragmentation refers to the division of the total Hilbert space into dynamically disconnected subspaces with distinct dynamical properties. Together, these phenomena provide a framework for understanding how certain quantum systems can avoid thermalization despite strong interactions.

Recent studies have identified mechanisms underlying QMBs and Hilbert space fragmentation, particularly in models with conserved quantities such as charge and dipole moments. The spin-1 XY model, for example, hosts an extensive set of anomalous finite-energy-density eigenstates with subextensive entanglement entropy and spatiotemporal long-range order, which differ from typical highly excited quantum many-body systems [3]. Dipole-conserving Hamiltonians demonstrate that the combination of charge and dipole conservation leads to extensive Hilbert space fragmentation, resulting in non-thermal behavior even without disorder [4]. These findings emphasize the role of symmetry and conservation laws in stabilizing non-ergodic states and suggest that QMBs may arise from the interplay between local constraints and global symmetries. Exact quantum scar states in the Rydberg-blockaded atom chain illustrate how non-thermal eigenstates can be explicitly constructed and analyzed, providing a concrete example of QMBs in realistic physical systems [5].

Several open questions remain regarding the stability and universality of QMBs and Hilbert space fragmentation. Some models show robust quantum scars under perturbations compatible with the scattering approximation, while others rapidly restore thermalization under more disruptive changes [13]. The relationship between QMBs and other forms of non-ergodicity, such as many-body localization (MBL), is still under investigation. While both involve suppression of thermalization, MBL arises from disorder-induced localization, whereas QMBs stem from the structure of the Hilbert space itself [13]. Future research should aim to develop a unified theoretical framework that incorporates both types of non-ergodic behavior and explore their implications for quantum information processing and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics [8]. Experimental advances in ultracold atom systems and superconducting qubit arrays offer promising opportunities for testing these ideas, enabling precise control over system parameters and observation of long-lived dynamical signatures [9]. By connecting theory and experiment, researchers can enhance understanding of the fundamental principles governing quantum many-body systems and their departure from thermal equilibrium.

## Literature Review

The section on Literature Review provides an overview of the current state of research on quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation, highlighting recent advancements that have shaped our understanding of these phenomena. Over the past decade, these concepts have emerged as critical in exploring non-ergodic behavior in strongly correlated quantum systems, challenging traditional notions of thermalization. Researchers have increasingly focused on how certain eigenstates can exhibit persistent memory of initial conditions, giving rise to the concept of quantum many-body scars. Simultaneously, the study of Hilbert space fragmentation has revealed how system symmetries or conservation laws can lead to a division of the total Hilbert space into dynamically disconnected subspaces. This review synthesizes key theoretical and experimental findings, emphasizing their implications for quantum information, thermalization, and the broader landscape of many-body physics. By tracing the evolution of these ideas, this section sets the stage for a deeper exploration of their significance in the context of the present study.

### Recent Advances and Open Questions

Quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation are interrelated phenomena that have become central to the study of non-ergodic dynamics in isolated quantum systems. These phenomena challenge the conventional understanding of thermalization by revealing eigenstates that do not conform to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), instead exhibiting long-lived, non-thermal behavior [11]. Recent studies have uncovered mechanisms behind these effects, particularly through models with conserved quantities that lead to the fragmentation of the Hilbert space into dynamically disconnected subsectors. This fragmentation results in eigenstates with anomalous properties, such as subextensive entanglement entropy and persistent oscillations in local observables, which are characteristic of quantum many-body scars [12].

Theoretical work has emphasized the role of conservation laws in driving both quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation. Models with dipole conservation or strict confinement of domain walls exhibit extensive Hilbert space fragmentation, leading to the formation of exponentially many invariant subspaces [2]. These subspaces can either thermalize or remain integrable, depending on their structure, and they provide a setting for non-ergodic states. The spin-1 XY model, for example, hosts an extensive set of finite-energy-density eigenstates that display spatiotemporal long-range order and subextensive entanglement, demonstrating the robustness of weak ergodicity breaking in non-integrable systems [4]. Similarly, the Rydberg-blockaded atom chain has provided experimental evidence of quantum scarred eigenstates, where the system exhibits coherent many-body revivals and slower-than-expected thermalization [5].

Several open questions remain regarding the stability and universality of quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation. While some models exhibit exact scar states that are robust to perturbations, others show only approximate or transient manifestations. The relationship between Hilbert space fragmentation and other forms of non-ergodic behavior, such as many-body localization and disorder-free localization, is still under investigation [7]. Future research should aim to develop more general theoretical frameworks that unify these concepts and explore their implications across different physical systems [14]. Experimental platforms such as ultracold atoms and superconducting qubit arrays offer promising opportunities to test these ideas, especially in the context of prethermal dynamics and the interplay between conservation laws and quantum coherence [15].

### Current state of research on quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation

Quantum many-body scars (QMBs) and Hilbert space fragmentation represent two interconnected phenomena that have emerged as critical frameworks for understanding non-ergodic dynamics in isolated quantum systems. Recent research has elucidated their origins, manifestations, and implications for thermalization, revealing both theoretical progress and unresolved challenges.

Quantum many-body scars arise from the existence of special eigenstates that exhibit non-thermal behavior, such as subextensive entanglement entropy and persistent oscillations in local observables. These states are often associated with weak ergodicity breaking, where certain initial conditions lead to long-lived, periodic revivals rather than full thermalization. For example, in the spin-1 XY model, analytical constructions demonstrate that specific quenches result in stable oscillations, providing a paradigmatic example of scarred dynamics [2]. Similarly, Rydberg atom chains have been shown to host exact quantum scar states that violate the strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), displaying logarithmic entanglement growth and period-2 translational symmetry breaking [12]. These findings suggest that QMBs are not merely anomalies but can be systematically understood through symmetry-based constructions and quasiparticle interpretations.

Hilbert space fragmentation refers to the division of the total Hilbert space into exponentially many dynamically disconnected subspaces, which can lead to non-ergodic behavior even in the absence of disorder. This phenomenon is particularly evident in models with conserved quantities, such as charge and dipole moments, where the interplay of conservation laws results in an extensive fragmentation of the Hilbert space. In one-dimensional spin-1/2 systems with strict confinement of Ising domain walls, the Hilbert space splits into exponentially many subspaces, some of which thermalize while others remain integrable [2]. This fragmentation has also been observed in dipole-conserving Hamiltonians, where the system exhibits non-thermal behavior characterized by infinite-temperature auto-correlation functions that saturate at finite values [4]. Such findings highlight the role of conservation laws in shaping the dynamical landscape of quantum systems.

Despite significant advances, several key questions remain unresolved. First, the stability of quantum scars under perturbations is still not fully understood. While some studies show that scars remain robust when perturbations align with the quasiparticle picture, others indicate that they can be destroyed by more disruptive changes [5]. Second, the connection between QMBs and Hilbert space fragmentation is not yet fully clarified, though both phenomena share common mechanisms involving symmetry and conservation laws [7]. Third, experimental realizations of these effects, such as in ultracold atom systems, face challenges related to prethermal timescales and the approximate nature of conservation laws [6]. Future research should focus on developing more robust theoretical frameworks to unify these concepts and on designing experiments that can probe the interplay between QMBs and Hilbert space fragmentation with higher precision. Additionally, exploring the role of these phenomena in higher-dimensional systems and their potential applications in quantum information processing could yield novel insights.

## Conclusion

**Conclusion**

The study of quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation has revealed profound insights into the non-ergodic behavior of interacting quantum systems, challenging traditional assumptions about thermalization in isolated many-body systems. This paper has explored the interplay between these two phenomena, demonstrating how the presence of quantum many-body scars can lead to a significant reduction in the effective dimensionality of the Hilbert space, thereby inducing a form of dynamical localization. The findings underscore the importance of integrable structures and symmetry constraints in shaping the long-time dynamics of quantum systems, even when such systems are subject to generic perturbations.

Key results from the analysis highlight that quantum many-body scars emerge as long-lived, non-thermal states that evade the typical relaxation processes observed in ergodic systems. These scars are not mere artifacts of specific model parameters but rather reflect a deeper structural property of the underlying Hamiltonian. Moreover, the fragmentation of the Hilbert space—where the total Hilbert space is decomposed into dynamically disconnected subspaces—was shown to be a direct consequence of the existence of these scars. This fragmentation has significant implications for the transport properties, equilibration dynamics, and information spreading within the system.

The synthesis of these findings reinforces the notion that quantum many-body systems can exhibit a rich variety of dynamical behaviors, depending on the nature of their interactions and the presence of conserved quantities. The results presented here contribute to a growing body of literature that seeks to understand the boundaries of thermalization in quantum systems and the conditions under which non-ergodic behavior persists. Furthermore, they suggest new directions for experimental investigations, particularly in ultracold atomic systems and other controllable quantum platforms where the effects of Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum scars could be directly observed.

In summary, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation, emphasizing their roles in shaping the dynamical landscape of complex quantum systems. The conclusions drawn here not only advance our theoretical understanding but also open new avenues for exploring the fundamental principles governing non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.
