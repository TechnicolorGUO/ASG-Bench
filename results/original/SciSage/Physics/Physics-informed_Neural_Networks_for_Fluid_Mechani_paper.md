### Background and Challenges of Physics-informed Neural Networks in Fluid Mechanics

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) integrate physical laws into the architecture of neural networks, enabling them to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) while respecting underlying physical constraints [2]. This approach has been applied to various problems, including nonlinear PDEs, fractional integral-differential equations, and stochastic PDEs, showcasing its versatility in modeling complex fluid systems [3]. By embedding governing equations such as the Navier-Stokes equations into the loss function, PINNs can infer solutions without explicit discretization, providing a data-driven alternative to traditional numerical methods like finite element or finite volume techniques [4]. However, the effectiveness of these models depends on the quality and quantity of training data, as well as the balance between data fitting and physical constraint enforcement [5]. Their performance on high-dimensional or highly nonlinear problems remains an active area of research [6].

The implementation of PINNs involves several technical challenges that impact their accuracy and efficiency. A major issue is the computational cost of solving PDEs over large domains, which often requires significant training times and resources [7]. The choice of network architecture, activation functions, and optimization strategies also influences the model's ability to capture essential features of fluid dynamics problems [7]. Recent studies have explored invariant-based architectures to improve generalizability in turbulent flow simulations, emphasizing the importance of incorporating physical symmetries [8]. Additionally, integrating PINNs with existing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) frameworks raises questions about compatibility, scalability, and the need for hybrid approaches combining data-driven learning with traditional solvers [9]. These challenges highlight the need for further research into optimizing PINN structures and training procedures to enhance their practical applicability [10].

Despite their potential, PINNs face limitations in theoretical understanding and robustness under uncertain conditions [11]. While they have shown superior performance in some cases compared to conventional CFD methods, unresolved issues include the convergence properties of the training process and sensitivity to initial conditions and boundary constraints [12]. The reliance on high-fidelity data for training can also be a limitation, particularly when experimental measurements are sparse or noisy [13]. Future research should focus on developing more efficient and scalable PINN variants capable of handling large-scale, multi-physics problems while maintaining physical consistency [14]. This could involve advanced regularization techniques, uncertainty quantification, and leveraging domain-specific knowledge to guide the learning process [15]. Addressing these challenges could make PINNs a powerful tool for advancing fluid dynamics modeling, enabling more accurate and computationally efficient simulations across diverse applications [16].

### Research motivation

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a transformative approach in fluid mechanics research, driven by the need to integrate physical laws directly into machine learning models [2]. This integration allows for the development of data-driven solutions that respect the governing equations of fluid dynamics, such as the Navier-Stokes equations. The primary motivation for this methodological innovation is to enhance the interpretability and generalizability of machine learning models in complex fluid systems, where traditional numerical methods may be computationally expensive or insufficiently accurate. By embedding physical constraints into the neural network architecture, PINNs enable the creation of surrogate models that are not only data-efficient but also inherently consistent with the underlying physics. For instance, Raissi et al. demonstrated how PINNs can infer velocity and pressure fields from flow visualizations, effectively bridging the gap between experimental data and theoretical models [2]. However, despite these advancements, the application of PINNs in fluid mechanics remains constrained by several unresolved challenges.

Methodologically, PINNs face significant limitations in handling high-dimensional and non-linear fluid dynamics problems, particularly when dealing with turbulent flows or multi-phase systems. While PINNs have shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and their fractional variants, they often struggle with the computational demands of large-scale simulations, especially when incorporating time-dependent or spatially varying boundary conditions [4]. Additionally, the accuracy of PINNs is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of training data, which can be scarce or noisy in real-world fluid mechanics applications. A critical gap in current research lies in the lack of robust validation frameworks that can systematically assess the performance of PINNs against established numerical solvers like the finite element method [5]. Furthermore, while PINNs excel at capturing global trends in fluid behavior, they often fail to resolve fine-scale features, such as vortices or shock waves, which are crucial for accurate predictions in many engineering and scientific contexts.

To address these methodological gaps, future research should focus on developing hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of PINNs with classical numerical techniques. One promising direction is the integration of PINNs with dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), a data-driven method for analyzing the dynamics of nonlinear systems [6]. Such an approach could leverage the ability of DMD to extract coherent structures from fluid flow data while using PINNs to enforce physical consistency. Another area for innovation is the refinement of loss functions to better balance data fidelity and physical constraint satisfaction, ensuring that models remain accurate even when trained on limited or noisy datasets [7]. Additionally, the development of more efficient optimization algorithms tailored for PDE-constrained problems could significantly reduce the computational burden associated with PINN training [7]. Finally, expanding the scope of PINNs to include stochastic and multiphysics problems would broaden their applicability in fluid mechanics, enabling more realistic and comprehensive modeling of complex systems [8]. These advancements would not only enhance the reliability of PINN-based models but also deepen our understanding of fluid dynamics through the lens of data-driven physics.

### Recent advancements in physics-informed neural networks for fluid mechanics

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a transformative methodology for solving fluid dynamics problems by integrating physical laws directly into the training process of neural networks [1]. These networks encode governing equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, as part of their architecture, enabling them to solve both forward and inverse problems in fluid mechanics while respecting the underlying physics. This approach has been particularly effective in data-driven solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), where PINNs act as universal function approximators that naturally incorporate prior knowledge of physical laws [3]. By combining observed data with the constraints imposed by PDEs, PINNs offer a powerful alternative to traditional numerical methods like the finite element method (FEM), which often require extensive computational resources and mesh generation [4].

Recent advancements in PINN methodologies have focused on improving their accuracy, efficiency, and applicability to complex fluid dynamics scenarios. For instance, researchers have explored variants such as physics-constrained neural networks (PCNNs), variational hp-VPINNs, and conservative PINNs (CPINNs), each tailored to specific types of PDEs and boundary conditions [8]. A notable development is the integration of invariance principles into network architectures, as demonstrated in the work on Reynolds-averaged turbulence modeling, where a novel network design incorporating Galilean invariance significantly improved the prediction of Reynolds stress anisotropy tensors [5]. Similarly, the "Hidden Fluid Mechanics" framework has shown promise in learning velocity and pressure fields from flow visualizations by leveraging the Navier-Stokes equations as a constraint [6]. These innovations highlight the growing versatility of PINNs in capturing complex fluid behaviors with minimal reliance on high-fidelity data.

Despite these advances, several challenges remain in the application of PINNs to fluid dynamics. One critical limitation is the difficulty in balancing data fidelity with the enforcement of physical constraints, particularly when dealing with sparse or noisy datasets [7]. Additionally, the computational cost associated with training PINNs can be substantial, especially for high-dimensional problems or those requiring long-time simulations [8]. Furthermore, while PINNs excel at encoding known physical laws, they may struggle to generalize to novel regimes or phenomena not explicitly captured by the governing equations [9]. Future research should focus on developing more efficient optimization strategies, enhancing the interpretability of PINN predictions, and integrating multi-fidelity data sources to improve robustness [10]. By addressing these challenges, PINNs could become even more impactful in advancing our understanding and simulation of fluid dynamics across a wide range of applications.

### Current state of research on physics-informed neural networks in fluid mechanics

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a transformative approach in fluid mechanics research, integrating physical laws directly into the training process of neural networks. These models leverage the structure of governing equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, to constrain the learning process, enabling them to solve complex problems with reduced reliance on large datasets [1]. Recent advances demonstrate that PINNs can infer solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), discover underlying physical laws, and serve as data-efficient surrogate models for fluid dynamics simulations [1]. This capability is particularly valuable in scenarios where high-fidelity experimental or numerical data are scarce, as PINNs can incorporate physical constraints to improve generalization and accuracy [4]. Furthermore, the integration of PINNs with deep learning frameworks has enabled the development of hybrid models that combine data-driven learning with first-principles physics, offering new avenues for modeling turbulent flows and other complex phenomena [3].

Despite these promising developments, several limitations persist in the application of PINNs to fluid mechanics. One major challenge is the computational cost associated with solving PDE-constrained optimization problems, especially when dealing with high-dimensional or time-dependent systems [2]. The need to simultaneously fit observed data and minimize the residual of the governing equations often leads to non-convex optimization landscapes, making training unstable and requiring careful hyperparameter tuning [2]. Additionally, the effectiveness of PINNs depends heavily on the quality and representativeness of the training data, as well as the accuracy of the embedded physical laws. For instance, while PINNs have shown success in modeling laminar flows, their performance in capturing turbulent dynamics remains an open challenge due to the inherent complexity and multiscale nature of turbulence [3]. Moreover, the lack of theoretical guarantees regarding convergence and stability in PINN-based solutions limits their applicability in safety-critical engineering contexts [2].

Recent trends in fluid mechanics research highlight the growing interest in enhancing the robustness and interpretability of PINNs through novel architectures and training strategies. For example, the development of physics-constrained neural networks (PCNNs) and variational hp-VPINNs aims to improve the flexibility of PINNs by incorporating adaptive basis functions and hierarchical representations [2]. These advancements suggest a shift toward more principled methods for embedding physical knowledge into neural networks, moving beyond simple residual minimization approaches. Another emerging direction involves the integration of PINNs with traditional numerical methods, such as finite element or finite volume schemes, to create hybrid solvers that combine the strengths of both data-driven and physics-based approaches [8]. Looking ahead, future research should focus on addressing the scalability of PINNs for large-scale fluid flow problems, developing efficient algorithms for real-time applications, and exploring the potential of PINNs in inverse problems, such as parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. By overcoming these challenges, PINNs could become a cornerstone of next-generation fluid mechanics modeling and simulation [2].
