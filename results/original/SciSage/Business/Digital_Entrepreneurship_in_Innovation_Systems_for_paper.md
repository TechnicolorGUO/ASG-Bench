## Introduction

In an era defined by rapid technological advancement and pressing environmental challenges, the role of digital entrepreneurship within innovation systems has emerged as a critical driver for sustainable transitions. As societies strive to balance economic growth with ecological resilience, digital entrepreneurs are increasingly positioned at the intersection of technology, business, and sustainability. This section explores the growing significance of digital entrepreneurship in shaping innovative pathways that support long-term environmental and social goals. By examining the evolving landscape of digital ventures within broader innovation ecosystems, we highlight how these initiatives can catalyze systemic change. Understanding this dynamic interplay is essential for policymakers, entrepreneurs, and researchers seeking to foster sustainable development. The following discussion sets the stage for a deeper exploration of how digital entrepreneurship contributes to and influences sustainable transitions.

### Research rationale

Digital entrepreneurship plays a pivotal role in fostering sustainable transitions within innovation systems by leveraging digital technologies to address complex societal challenges, reconfigure traditional business models, and catalyze systemic transformations. This role is particularly evident in the context of sustainability goals, where digital entrepreneurs act as agents of change by integrating technological advancements with environmental and social imperatives. Their ability to innovate within digital ecosystems enables them to create new value propositions that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in areas such as climate action, resource efficiency, and inclusive growth. By adopting agile methodologies and utilizing data-driven decision-making, these entrepreneurs can rapidly adapt to evolving market demands while promoting long-term sustainability.

The interplay between digital entrepreneurship and innovation systems is further complicated by the need for dynamic capabilities that enable firms to sense, seize, and transform opportunities in an increasingly interconnected world. Unlike traditional entrepreneurial ventures, digital entrepreneurs often operate within platform-based ecosystems, which introduce unique power dynamics and dependencies. These platforms, while offering unprecedented access to markets and resources, also pose risks related to asymmetry, monopolistic tendencies, and the erosion of competitive diversity. Consequently, digital entrepreneurs must navigate these challenges through strategic positioning, collaborative networking, and continuous learning. This process not only enhances their own resilience but also contributes to the broader innovation system by fostering cross-sectoral knowledge exchange and co-creation. The integration of digital tools into traditional industries further underscores the transformative potential of digital entrepreneurship, as seen in sectors such as renewable energy, agriculture, and healthcare, where digital solutions are driving systemic shifts toward sustainability.

Despite its promise, the role of digital entrepreneurship in sustainable transitions remains underexplored in both academic and policy discourse. Current research tends to focus on the technical and economic dimensions of digital innovation, often neglecting the socio-institutional factors that shape its impact. For instance, the concept of "platform-dependent entrepreneurs" highlights the vulnerabilities faced by digital entrepreneurs within dominant platform ecosystems, where control over data, algorithms, and user engagement is concentrated in the hands of a few large corporations. This raises critical questions about the inclusivity and equity of digital innovation systems. Future research should therefore prioritize the development of frameworks that account for the interdependencies between digital entrepreneurship, institutional structures, and sustainability outcomes. Additionally, there is a need to investigate how digital entrepreneurs can effectively leverage emerging technologies—such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things—to design more resilient and equitable innovation systems. Such studies would not only advance theoretical understanding but also provide actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners seeking to harness digital entrepreneurship as a driver of sustainable development.

### Background and Literature Review on Digital Entrepreneurship in Innovation Systems for Sustainable Transitions

The integration of digital entrepreneurship into innovation systems for sustainable transitions represents a critical area of inquiry, with theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence offering diverse insights into how digital technologies and entrepreneurial activities interact to drive systemic change. This systematic review synthesizes current knowledge, highlighting both the conceptual underpinnings and practical implications of this intersection.

Theoretical frameworks for digital entrepreneurship in innovation systems emphasize its role in reconfiguring innovation ecosystems. The dynamic capabilities framework underscores the importance of entrepreneurial action in sensing, seizing, and transforming opportunities, particularly in rapidly evolving digital environments [2]. This perspective aligns with the notion that digital entrepreneurs possess unique strategic competencies that enable them to navigate complex technological and market landscapes. Additionally, the concept of platform-dependent entrepreneurship introduces power asymmetries within digital ecosystems, suggesting that traditional entrepreneurial models must be adapted to account for the structural constraints imposed by dominant platforms [3]. These frameworks collectively highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of how digital entrepreneurship operates within broader institutional and technological contexts, yet they often lack explicit attention to sustainability outcomes, which remains an underdeveloped area in the literature [4].

Empirical studies reveal both the potential and challenges of digital entrepreneurship in fostering sustainable transitions. Research on women digital entrepreneurs illustrates how intersectional identities shape access to resources and opportunities, challenging the myth of the internet as a neutral space for innovation [5]. Similarly, studies on platform-based business models demonstrate how digital entrepreneurs can leverage network effects to scale sustainable solutions, though they also face significant risks related to dependency on platform architectures [6]. In the context of environmental sustainability, digital technologies have been shown to enhance resource efficiency and facilitate circular economy practices, but their impact is often mediated by factors such as regulatory environments and consumer behavior [7]. While these findings underscore the transformative potential of digital entrepreneurship, they also reveal persistent gaps in understanding how to systematically integrate digital innovations into existing socio-technical systems to achieve long-term sustainability goals.

Despite growing interest in digital entrepreneurship’s role in sustainable transitions, several methodological and conceptual challenges remain unresolved. Current research often lacks longitudinal data, making it difficult to assess the long-term impacts of digital entrepreneurial initiatives on systemic change [8]. Furthermore, there is a tendency to conflate digitalization with digitization, leading to inconsistent definitions and measurement approaches [9]. To address these issues, future research should prioritize interdisciplinary methodologies that combine insights from innovation studies, sustainability science, and digital sociology [9]. Specifically, investigations into the co-evolution of digital entrepreneurship and institutional frameworks—such as policies promoting open innovation or digital public infrastructure—could provide valuable guidance for practitioners and policymakers [10]. Additionally, more attention is needed to explore how digital entrepreneurs can contribute to resilience-building in socio-ecological systems, particularly in the face of global challenges like climate change and resource scarcity [11]. By bridging these theoretical and empirical gaps, researchers can better inform strategies for leveraging digital entrepreneurship as a driver of inclusive and sustainable development.

### Recent Developments in Digital Entrepreneurship and Sustainable Transitions

Digital entrepreneurship innovation systems have emerged as pivotal drivers of sustainable transitions, with recent developments underscoring their role in addressing complex socio-ecological challenges through digital technologies. These systems integrate entrepreneurial activities with digital tools and platforms, enabling novel business models, resource configurations, and value creation processes that align with sustainability goals. The interplay between digital transformation and entrepreneurship has been increasingly recognized as a critical pathway for achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in sectors such as energy, agriculture, and education. However, the conceptualization of digital entrepreneurship remains fragmented, with ongoing debates about its distinctiveness from traditional entrepreneurship and its relationship to broader digitalization processes. This conceptual ambiguity highlights the need for more rigorous theoretical frameworks that can capture the unique dynamics of digital entrepreneurial ecosystems.

Recent studies emphasize the importance of digital platforms in shaping entrepreneurial opportunities and capabilities, particularly in the context of platform-dependent entrepreneurs (PDEs) who navigate power asymmetries and structural constraints within platform-mediated markets. These findings reveal that digital entrepreneurship is not merely a technological extension of traditional practices but involves reconfiguring institutional logics, trust mechanisms, and governance structures to support sustainable outcomes. For instance, research on digital business models demonstrates how firms can leverage data-driven insights and network effects to create scalable solutions for environmental and social challenges. However, the literature also points to significant gaps, including the limited understanding of how digital innovations interact with local contexts, the underexplored role of policy in fostering inclusive digital ecosystems, and the lack of empirical evidence on the long-term sustainability of digital entrepreneurial ventures.

The concept of resilience thinking further enriches the discourse on digital entrepreneurship by emphasizing the capacity of socio-ecological systems to adapt and transform in response to disruptions. This perspective aligns with emerging trends in digital innovation systems, which prioritize flexibility, learning, and co-creation as key attributes for navigating uncertainty. For example, the integration of artificial intelligence in education and healthcare has demonstrated the potential for digital tools to enhance both efficiency and equity, yet these applications remain unevenly distributed across regions and sectors. Future research should focus on mapping the feedback loops between digital entrepreneurship and systemic sustainability transitions, exploring how entrepreneurial actions contribute to or hinder the emergence of resilient, low-carbon economies. Additionally, there is a pressing need to develop metrics that capture the multidimensional impacts of digital innovation, moving beyond narrow economic indicators to include social and environmental dimensions. By addressing these gaps, scholars and practitioners can better harness the transformative potential of digital entrepreneurship in advancing global sustainability agendas.

### State of Research on Digital Entrepreneurship in Innovation Systems for Sustainable Transitions

Digital entrepreneurship research has increasingly intersected with innovation systems, particularly in the context of sustainable transitions. While existing literature highlights the role of digital technologies in fostering entrepreneurial activities and driving systemic change, significant gaps remain in understanding how these innovations interact within broader innovation ecosystems to support sustainability goals.

The integration of digital entrepreneurship into innovation systems is a critical yet underexplored area. Research on digital business models and transformation often emphasizes technological capabilities without sufficiently addressing how these innovations are embedded within or reshape institutional and organizational contexts. For instance, while studies highlight the potential of digital platforms to enable new forms of value creation, they frequently overlook the structural and cultural barriers that hinder their adoption by marginalized or resource-constrained actors. This omission limits the applicability of findings to real-world scenarios where innovation systems are characterized by heterogeneous actors, power imbalances, and varying levels of technological readiness. Furthermore, the interplay between digital entrepreneurship and traditional innovation mechanisms—such as R&D investment, policy frameworks, and knowledge diffusion—remains inadequately conceptualized, creating a fragmented understanding of how digital innovations contribute to systemic sustainability transitions.

A key gap lies in the lack of empirical studies examining how digital entrepreneurship contributes to specific sustainability outcomes, such as reduced carbon footprints, circular economy practices, or equitable access to resources. While some works acknowledge the potential of digital tools to address environmental and social challenges, they often fail to provide concrete evidence of their impact on system-level transformations. For example, the role of digital platforms in facilitating collaborative consumption or decentralized energy systems is discussed in theoretical terms, but there is limited data on their scalability, long-term viability, or alignment with broader sustainability agendas. Additionally, the concept of "digital sustainability" remains loosely defined, with inconsistent metrics for evaluating the environmental and social impacts of digital innovations. This ambiguity hinders the development of targeted policies and strategies to harness digital entrepreneurship for sustainable development.

To advance the field, future research should prioritize interdisciplinary approaches that bridge digital entrepreneurship with innovation system theories, emphasizing both technological and socio-institutional dimensions. Specifically, there is a need for studies that investigate how digital entrepreneurs navigate and influence institutional structures to drive sustainable transitions. This includes exploring the role of policy interventions, network dynamics, and co-creation processes in shaping innovation trajectories. Moreover, longitudinal analyses of digital startups operating in sustainability-focused sectors could provide insights into the conditions that foster resilience and adaptability in the face of systemic challenges. Finally, developing standardized frameworks for assessing the sustainability impact of digital innovations would enhance the rigor and comparability of research, enabling more effective policy design and stakeholder engagement.
