## Introduction

Computational thinking has emerged as a critical skill in the 21st century, fostering problem-solving, logical reasoning, and creativity across diverse disciplines. As technology continues to shape modern education, integrating computational thinking into curricula has become a growing priority. Scratch, a visual programming language designed for beginners, offers an accessible platform for students to engage with computational concepts in an intuitive and interactive way. This paper explores the role of Scratch in promoting computational thinking within educational settings, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between abstract concepts and practical application. The motivation behind this research stems from the increasing demand for digital literacy and the need for effective tools that can support learners at all levels. By examining the intersection of computational thinking and Scratch-based learning, this study aims to contribute to ongoing discussions about innovative pedagogical approaches in education.

### Background of Computational Thinking in Education with Scratch

Computational thinking (CT) education has become a critical component of 21st-century curricula, with calls to integrate it into compulsory education as a foundational skill similar to literacy and numeracy. The integration of CT into existing educational frameworks presents significant challenges, including defining its scope, aligning it with traditional pedagogical practices, and addressing disparities in resource availability across different educational contexts. Some scholars advocate for embedding CT within interdisciplinary curricula to foster problem-solving and logical reasoning, while others emphasize the need for a dedicated CT framework that transcends subject boundaries. This divergence complicates standardization efforts, particularly in formal educational settings with rigid curricular structures.

A major challenge in integrating CT into school curricula is the lack of consensus on its core components and how they should be operationalized at different grade levels. Early work by Papert positioned CT as an extension of constructivist learning through tools like LOGO, emphasizing hands-on, exploratory learning [2]. However, subsequent research highlights the difficulty of translating such theoretical models into practical classroom activities that meet standardized assessment criteria. This tension between innovation and accountability is exacerbated in under-resourced educational systems, where the infrastructure and teacher training necessary to support CT are often lacking. The digital divide remains a persistent barrier, as access to computational tools and internet connectivity varies significantly between developed and developing regions, raising concerns about equity in CT education [3][4].

The integration of CT into curricula also necessitates rethinking pedagogical approaches to accommodate its unique demands. Unlike traditional subjects, CT requires a balance between algorithmic thinking, abstraction, and real-world application, which can be challenging to achieve within conventional lesson structures. Research suggests that successful CT integration depends on teacher preparedness, with educators needing both technical expertise and pedagogical strategies to facilitate inquiry-based learning. However, many teachers lack the training to implement CT effectively, particularly in non-STEM disciplines where the relevance of CT may be less apparent. Addressing these gaps requires systemic investments in professional development and curriculum design, as well as ongoing collaboration between policymakers, educators, and technology developers to ensure that CT education is both accessible and meaningful for all learners.

### Research gaps and challenges

Computational thinking (CT) has emerged as a critical competency in K-12 education, with increasing emphasis on integrating it into curricula to foster problem-solving and logical reasoning skills. However, significant gaps persist in how CT is conceptualized, taught, and assessed, particularly when leveraging visual programming languages (VPLs). While VPLs such as Scratch and OpenAlea are designed to make programming accessible through drag-and-drop interfaces, their role in advancing CT remains underexplored in the literature. This gap is compounded by the lack of standardized frameworks for defining CT competencies and aligning them with specific VPL tools, leading to inconsistent pedagogical approaches across educational settings.

The integration of VPLs into CT education is often framed within broader discussions of STEM and maker movements, which emphasize hands-on, project-based learning. However, these frameworks frequently prioritize technical skill development over deeper CT concepts such as decomposition, pattern recognition, and algorithmic thinking. For instance, while tools like OpenAlea facilitate complex modeling tasks, they do not explicitly scaffold students’ ability to translate real-world problems into computational abstractions. Similarly, the use of VPLs in maker spaces tends to focus on tangible outcomes rather than cultivating the metacognitive processes central to CT. This disconnect suggests that current implementations of VPLs may not fully realize their potential to support the cognitive dimensions of CT, as outlined in theoretical models that emphasize its interdisciplinary nature.

A critical challenge in addressing these gaps lies in the absence of robust assessment mechanisms that can measure CT proficiency through VPL-based activities. While some studies highlight the utility of VPLs in promoting engagement and reducing barriers to entry for novice learners, there is limited evidence on how these tools impact long-term CT development or transferability to traditional programming paradigms. Furthermore, the literature lacks comparative analyses of different VPLs in terms of their efficacy in fostering specific CT components, such as abstraction or generalization. Future research should prioritize the development of validated assessment frameworks that align with CT constructs and investigate how VPL design features influence learners’ conceptual understanding. Such efforts would not only enhance the pedagogical value of VPLs but also contribute to a more cohesive and evidence-based approach to CT education in K-12 settings.

It also identifies gaps in the literature, setting the stage for the analysis that follows. Through this review, readers will gain insight into the broader context of CT in education and the growing body of work supporting its implementation.

### Recent Advancements in Computational Thinking Education with Scratch

Recent advancements in computational thinking (CT) education have increasingly integrated tools like Scratch to foster foundational programming and problem-solving skills among young learners. Computational thinking is conceptualized as a universal competence that should be embedded in every child's analytical toolkit, with Scratch serving as an accessible platform for introducing core CT concepts such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm design. The article emphasizes the need to define and operationalize CT in both formal and informal educational settings, suggesting that Scratch can act as a bridge between abstract computational principles and tangible, interactive learning experiences. By allowing students to create visual programs through block-based coding, Scratch facilitates the development of logical reasoning and iterative problem-solving skills, which are critical components of CT.

Research on the pedagogical effectiveness of Scratch reveals nuanced insights into its role in computational thinking education. A study examining the impact of AI code generators like OpenAI Codex on novice learners found that while such tools can significantly enhance performance in code-authoring tasks, they also raise concerns about over-reliance and reduced retention of fundamental programming concepts [7]. This suggests that while Scratch and similar platforms offer valuable scaffolding for beginners, educators must balance their use with deliberate practice in manual coding to ensure deep conceptual understanding. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of structured interventions that guide learners in leveraging these tools without compromising their ability to think computationally. For instance, learners who had prior exposure to Codex showed better retention of programming knowledge, indicating that technology-assisted learning can complement traditional methods when used strategically [3].

Despite the growing adoption of Scratch in CT education, several challenges remain in ensuring equitable access and effective implementation. The integration of AI-driven tools and computational thinking curricula faces barriers related to infrastructure, teacher training, and curriculum alignment, particularly in developing regions where digital literacy and technological resources may be limited [2]. Moreover, while Scratch provides an intuitive interface for beginners, its potential for fostering higher-order CT skills—such as debugging, optimization, and system design—requires more advanced pedagogical strategies and scaffolding. Future research should focus on developing adaptive learning frameworks that tailor Scratch-based CT instruction to diverse learner needs, incorporating feedback mechanisms that support metacognitive growth. Additionally, longitudinal studies are needed to assess the long-term impact of early CT exposure through Scratch on students' academic and career trajectories in STEM fields. These efforts will be critical in realizing the full potential of computational thinking education as a transformative force in modern pedagogy.

### Current State of Research on Scratch-Based Computational Thinking Education

Computational thinking (CT) education has emerged as a critical component of modern curricula, with Scratch serving as a prominent tool for introducing young learners to programming and problem-solving. Empirical studies on Scratch-based CT education reveal a complex landscape of pedagogical approaches, outcomes, and challenges, reflecting both the potential and limitations of this approach in compulsory education.

Pedagogical Approaches and Outcomes  
Scratch, a visual programming language designed for children, has been widely adopted in educational settings to foster computational thinking through block-based coding. Research indicates that Scratch supports the development of core CT skills such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm design [1]. However, the empirical evidence on its effectiveness is mixed. A study involving 69 novice learners found that access to AI code generators like OpenAI Codex significantly improved performance in Python code-authoring tasks, suggesting that integrated tools can enhance learning outcomes [7]. While this study does not directly involve Scratch, it highlights the broader trend of leveraging technology to support programming education. In contrast, other studies emphasize the importance of structured guidance in Scratch-based CT instruction. For instance, research underscores the need for clear definitions of CT’s core and peripheral aspects, as well as strategies to address both formal and informal learning environments [1]. These findings suggest that while Scratch provides an accessible platform, its pedagogical success depends on how it is implemented within curricular frameworks.

Challenges and Limitations  
Despite its popularity, Scratch-based CT education faces several empirical and practical challenges. One key issue is the difficulty in measuring the transferability of CT skills beyond the Scratch environment. While some studies demonstrate improvements in problem-solving abilities, others note that these gains are often domain-specific and do not generalize to more abstract or text-based programming contexts [1]. Additionally, the lack of standardized assessment tools for CT remains a significant barrier. The absence of consensus on how to define and evaluate CT competencies complicates efforts to assess the efficacy of Scratch-based interventions [7]. Furthermore, the reliance on visual programming may inadvertently create a dependency on graphical interfaces, potentially hindering the development of deeper conceptual understanding of programming principles [3]. This concern is echoed in broader discussions about the limitations of non-parametric knowledge integration in language models, where over-reliance on external resources can undermine the development of internalized knowledge [8].

Future Directions and Implications  
To advance the empirical status quo of Scratch-based CT education, future research must address several critical gaps. First, there is a need for longitudinal studies that track the long-term impact of Scratch-based learning on students’ computational thinking and broader STEM engagement. Such studies could provide insights into how early exposure to Scratch influences later academic and career trajectories. Second, the development of robust, standardized assessment tools for CT is essential to enable meaningful comparisons across different educational interventions. This aligns with calls for more rigorous evaluation methods in science education, where reliability and validity of instruments remain central concerns [6]. Third, researchers should explore hybrid approaches that combine Scratch with more advanced programming environments, aiming to bridge the gap between visual and textual programming. This could help mitigate the risk of over-reliance on graphical interfaces while fostering deeper conceptual understanding. Finally, further investigation into the role of teacher training and curriculum design is warranted, as these factors significantly influence the effectiveness of CT education [1]. By addressing these challenges, the field can move toward a more comprehensive and empirically grounded understanding of how Scratch contributes to computational thinking education.
