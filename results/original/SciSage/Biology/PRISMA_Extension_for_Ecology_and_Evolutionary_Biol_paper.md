## Introduction

The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology represents a critical advancement in enhancing the transparency and rigor of systematic reviews within these fields. As ecological and evolutionary research increasingly relies on synthesizing diverse and complex data, there is a growing need for standardized reporting frameworks that address the unique challenges of this domain. This extension was developed to bridge the gap between general PRISMA guidelines and the specific methodological nuances encountered in ecological and evolutionary studies. The motivation for this work stems from the recognition that existing reporting standards often fail to capture the full scope of these disciplines, potentially leading to incomplete or misleading conclusions. By tailoring PRISMA to better suit the needs of ecologists and evolutionary biologists, this extension aims to improve the quality, reproducibility, and impact of systematic reviews in these areas. This section provides an overview of the background and rationale behind the development of this specialized PRISMA extension.

### Background of the PRISMA Extension for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology

The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement has evolved into a critical methodological framework for ensuring transparency and rigor in systematic reviews, particularly within the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. While the original PRISMA 2009 statement was primarily developed for healthcare interventions, its adaptation to ecological and evolutionary research is essential due to the unique challenges inherent in these disciplines. The PRISMA-P (Protocol) extension further enhances this framework by providing a structured approach to planning and reporting systematic reviews, thereby addressing the specific needs of ecological and evolutionary studies [1].

In ecological and evolutionary research, systematic reviews often grapple with complex data structures, heterogeneous study designs, and the need to integrate both observational and experimental evidence. The PRISMA extension addresses these challenges by emphasizing the importance of clearly defining review objectives, specifying inclusion criteria, and detailing search strategies that account for the diversity of ecological datasets. For instance, the PRISMA-P checklist includes items such as "eligibility criteria" and "information sources," which are crucial for ensuring that ecological reviews capture the full spectrum of available evidence while minimizing bias [1]. Additionally, the PRISMA 2020 update introduced new guidance on the synthesis of qualitative and quantitative data, which is particularly relevant for evolutionary studies that often involve phylogenetic analyses and trait-based comparisons [4].

Despite the robustness of the PRISMA framework, its application in ecology and evolutionary biology faces several methodological challenges. One significant issue is the variability in how ecological and evolutionary traits are defined and measured across studies, which can complicate the synthesis of findings. Furthermore, the reliance on presence-only data in species distribution modeling, as highlighted in studies like those on Maxent and novel modeling techniques, introduces additional layers of complexity that traditional PRISMA guidelines may not fully address [7]. To mitigate these issues, future adaptations of the PRISMA framework should incorporate more explicit guidance on handling ecological data heterogeneity, including recommendations for standardizing trait definitions and integrating advanced statistical methods such as generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) [6]. Moreover, the development of specialized checklists tailored to ecological and evolutionary research could enhance the applicability of PRISMA, ensuring that reviews are both methodologically sound and ecologically relevant.

### Research rationale

The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement has become a cornerstone in enhancing the transparency and methodological rigor of healthcare research. However, its application to ecology and evolutionary biology presents unique challenges and opportunities, necessitating tailored extensions to address the specific epistemological and methodological frameworks of these disciplines. While PRISMA provides a structured checklist for systematic reviews, its original formulation was designed primarily for clinical and health-related studies, which may not fully capture the complexity of ecological and evolutionary research [2]. This discrepancy highlights the need for a PRISMA extension that acknowledges the distinct characteristics of ecological data, such as non-randomized observational studies, long-term monitoring, and the integration of multiple scales of biological organization.

One critical motivation for developing a PRISMA extension for ecology and evolutionary biology lies in the inherent variability and context-dependence of ecological systems. Unlike controlled clinical trials, ecological studies often involve natural experiments with limited experimental control, making it imperative to document methodological choices, sampling strategies, and environmental contexts with greater precision [9]. For instance, the assessment of niche conservatism or the analysis of phylogenetic community structure requires detailed reporting of environmental variables, spatial scales, and phylogenetic relationships, which are not typically emphasized in the standard PRISMA framework [9]. Furthermore, the integration of diverse data types—such as species occurrence records, functional traits, and environmental covariates—demands a more nuanced approach to study selection, data extraction, and synthesis than is currently provided by the original PRISMA guidelines [4].

A key critique of applying standard PRISMA to ecological research is its limited attention to the theoretical and conceptual underpinnings of ecological and evolutionary studies. Ecological meta-analyses often aim to test hypotheses about mechanisms, patterns, or processes, rather than simply evaluating the efficacy of interventions [10]. This necessitates a re-evaluation of how outcomes are defined, how heterogeneity is addressed, and how results are interpreted within an ecological framework. For example, the inclusion of phylogenetic information in analyses of trait evolution or community assembly requires specialized statistical methods that are not well represented in existing PRISMA guidance [6]. Additionally, the dynamic and often nonlinear nature of ecological processes challenges the linear, hypothesis-driven approach embedded in traditional systematic review protocols, suggesting that a more flexible and adaptive reporting framework is needed [7].

## Rationale for PRISMA Extension in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology

The 'Literature Review' section provides an overview of the current state of research in ecology and evolutionary biology, highlighting recent developments that have shaped the field. As methodologies and analytical techniques continue to evolve, so too does the need for standardized reporting frameworks to ensure transparency and reproducibility. This section examines how existing review practices have adapted to these changes, identifying trends and gaps in the literature. It also explores the growing emphasis on rigorous evidence synthesis within ecological and evolutionary studies. By situating contemporary research within a broader context, this review sets the stage for understanding the rationale behind the PRISMA extension tailored for this discipline. Ultimately, it underscores the importance of methodological clarity in advancing scientific inquiry in ecology and evolutionary biology.

### Recent Advances in PRISMA Extensions for Ecological and Evolutionary Research

Recent developments in PRISMA extensions have significantly enhanced the methodological rigor and transparency of systematic reviews in ecological and evolutionary biology, addressing concerns about reporting quality and reproducibility. The PRISMA-EcoEvo extension, introduced as a specialized adaptation of the original PRISMA statement, provides a structured framework for reporting systematic reviews that focus on ecological and evolutionary phenomena. This extension addresses critical gaps identified in prior studies, where reporting quality was found to be suboptimal, particularly in areas related to trustworthiness and methodological transparency. By incorporating 27 main items tailored to the unique challenges of ecological and evolutionary research, PRISMA-EcoEvo ensures that reviewers systematically document their search strategies, data extraction processes, and synthesis methods, thereby improving the reliability of conclusions drawn from such reviews.

The evolution of PRISMA extensions has also seen the development of specialized guidelines for diverse review types, including scoping reviews and diagnostic test accuracy studies. For instance, the PRISMA-ScR guideline offers updated methodological guidance for conducting JBI scoping reviews, emphasizing the importance of clarifying how results are extracted, analyzed, and presented. This is particularly relevant in ecological and evolutionary contexts, where the scope of reviews often extends beyond traditional systematic reviews to include non-research sources such as policy documents and grey literature. Similarly, the PRISMA-DTA extension addresses the specific needs of diagnostic test accuracy reviews, which are increasingly relevant in ecological applications such as species identification or disease monitoring [11]. These extensions collectively reflect a growing recognition of the need for tailored reporting standards that align with the methodological diversity of ecological and evolutionary research.

Despite these advancements, challenges remain in ensuring consistent application of PRISMA extensions across disciplines and study designs. While the PRISMA-EcoEvo and other extensions provide valuable guidance, their implementation is often inconsistent, with many reviews failing to fully adhere to the recommended checklist items. Additionally, there is a need for further refinement of these guidelines to address emerging methodological issues, such as the integration of complex data types (e.g., phylogenetic information, environmental datasets) into systematic reviews [12][3]. Future research should focus on evaluating the impact of PRISMA extensions on review quality and on developing training resources to support their adoption. Moreover, the development of digital tools that automate adherence to PRISMA guidelines could enhance both the efficiency and consistency of systematic reviews in ecological and evolutionary biology. Such innovations would not only improve the transparency of evidence synthesis but also strengthen the scientific foundation for policy and conservation decisions based on ecological research.

### Current state of PRISMA-EcoEvo adoption and implementation

The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension for ecology and evolutionary biology, known as PRISMA-EcoEvo, was developed to address poor reporting quality in meta-analyses, which can undermine the reliability of conclusions [11]. The guideline includes a checklist of 27 items aimed at ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and comprehensiveness in systematic reviews. Its development involved consultation with researchers, editors, and reviewers, reflecting an effort to align with community standards. However, the literature shows that reporting quality remains suboptimal, with few studies referencing the guideline, indicating a need for greater adoption.

PRISMA-EcoEvo builds on the broader PRISMA framework while addressing the specific methodological challenges of ecological and evolutionary research. These studies often involve complex, non-experimental data, requiring attention to study design, sampling methods, and statistical approaches. The guideline provides guidance on reporting study selection, data extraction, and synthesis in ways appropriate for the field. It emphasizes defining the review question, justifying inclusion criteria, and accounting for potential biases, which are essential for methodological rigor and practical utility.

Despite improvements, gaps remain in the implementation of PRISMA-EcoEvo. Many studies do not fully adhere to all 27 items, particularly those related to methodology and data synthesis. There is limited empirical evidence assessing its impact on review quality, making it difficult to evaluate effectiveness [12]. Additionally, the guideline primarily focuses on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, leaving other types of evidence syntheses less addressed. Future research should focus on evaluating the uptake and impact of PRISMA-EcoEvo, enhancing its applicability to diverse study designs, and integrating it with other guidelines to create a more cohesive framework for evidence synthesis in ecological and evolutionary research [3].

## Conclusion
