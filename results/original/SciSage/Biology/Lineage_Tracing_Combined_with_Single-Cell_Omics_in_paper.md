## Introduction

The integration of lineage tracing with single-cell omics has emerged as a powerful approach to unravel the complex dynamics of cellular development and differentiation. Traditionally, lineage tracing has provided insights into cell fate decisions, while single-cell omics offers high-resolution views of gene expression and molecular states. Together, these technologies enable researchers to map developmental trajectories with unprecedented precision, linking genetic programs to cellular outcomes. This combination is particularly valuable in understanding heterogeneous tissues and dynamic biological processes. As experimental and computational methods continue to advance, the synergy between lineage information and single-cell data is reshaping our understanding of embryogenesis, tissue homeostasis, and disease progression. This section explores the motivations behind this integrative approach and provides a foundational overview of its growing impact on modern biology.

### Research challenges and opportunities

Lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics have emerged as powerful tools for understanding cellular differentiation and heterogeneity, yet their integration presents significant methodological challenges. Lineage tracing, which involves tracking the developmental history of cells through genetic markers or reporter systems, provides critical insights into cell fate decisions and temporal dynamics. Single-cell transcriptomics, on the other hand, offers high-resolution snapshots of gene expression across individual cells, enabling the identification of distinct cell states and trajectories. While these approaches are complementary, their integration is complicated by technical limitations such as the resolution of lineage information, the accuracy of trajectory inference, and the compatibility of data modalities. For instance, lineage tracing often relies on sparse genetic labels that may not capture the full complexity of cellular transitions, whereas single-cell RNA-seq data can be noisy and subject to batch effects, complicating the alignment of lineage and transcriptional profiles.

The integration of lineage tracing with single-cell transcriptomics has been particularly challenging in contexts where cellular plasticity and phenotypic switching are prevalent, such as in atherosclerosis and cancer. In atherosclerosis, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) exhibit phenotypic switching, transitioning between differentiated and less-differentiated states that complicate lineage assignment. Similarly, in cancer, tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution necessitate robust lineage reconstruction methods to track the emergence of malignant subclones. These complexities highlight the need for advanced computational frameworks that can reconcile lineage data with high-dimensional transcriptomic profiles. Tools like Slingshot, which combines lineage inference with trajectory analysis, have shown promise in identifying multiple cell trajectories from single-cell data, but their performance is contingent on the quality and comprehensiveness of the underlying lineage information. Furthermore, while lineage tracing can provide temporal context, it often lacks the resolution to capture subtle transcriptional changes that define cell state transitions, underscoring the necessity of integrating multi-omics data for a more holistic understanding.

Despite these challenges, recent advances in lineage tracing technologies and single-cell methodologies offer new opportunities for overcoming existing limitations. The development of double-fluorescent Cre reporter mice, such as mT/mG, has enabled precise visualization of lineage relationships at the single-cell level. Additionally, the integration of lineage tracing with spatial transcriptomics could provide insights into how cellular identity is maintained or altered within tissue microenvironments. However, these approaches remain underexplored, particularly in complex tissues with dynamic cellular interactions. Future research should focus on developing unified analytical pipelines that harmonize lineage data with single-cell transcriptomics, leveraging machine learning to infer latent trajectories and account for biological variability. Such efforts would not only enhance our understanding of developmental and disease processes but also pave the way for more targeted therapeutic interventions based on precise cellular mapping.

### Background and Integration of Lineage Tracing with Single-Cell Omics

Lineage tracing, a technique that tracks the developmental history of cells, has become increasingly integrated with single-cell transcriptomics to provide a more comprehensive understanding of cellular dynamics during development and disease. This integration allows researchers to map cell lineage relationships while simultaneously capturing gene expression profiles at unprecedented resolution. For instance, Slingshot, a computational tool designed for single-cell transcriptomics, combines robust lineage inference with pseudotime analysis to identify multiple trajectories in complex datasets [1]. Such approaches are critical for elucidating dynamic gene expression patterns over time, particularly in systems where cell fate decisions are not linear or straightforward. The ability to reconstruct lineage trees from transcriptomic data enhances our capacity to study cellular differentiation, regeneration, and plasticity in both healthy and pathological contexts.

The synergy between lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is further exemplified by studies that use genetic reporters to label specific cell populations and then apply scRNA-seq to characterize their molecular identities. The mT/mG double-fluorescent reporter mouse, for example, enables precise visualization of Cre-dependent lineage events, allowing researchers to track the progeny of labeled cells across tissues and developmental stages [3]. When combined with scRNA-seq, this approach provides a powerful framework for identifying transcriptional signatures associated with distinct lineages and their functional states. Similarly, lineage tracing experiments in the lung have revealed that type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s) function as stem cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation into AEC1s, a process that can be validated through both in vivo and in vitro analyses [2]. These findings underscore the value of integrating lineage tracing with high-throughput transcriptomic profiling to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular identity and function.

Despite these advances, challenges remain in reconciling lineage information with the high-dimensional data generated by single-cell technologies. One major limitation is the potential for confounding factors such as technical noise, batch effects, and incomplete coverage of cell states. Additionally, while lineage tracing can reveal the ancestry of cells, it does not inherently provide insights into the regulatory networks governing cell fate decisions. To address these gaps, emerging tools like Enrichr offer gene set enrichment analysis that can help interpret lineage-specific transcriptomic data within the context of known biological pathways [8]. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated computational models that integrate lineage information with multi-omics data, enabling a systems-level understanding of cellular development and disease progression. By refining these integrative approaches, researchers can unlock new possibilities for studying cellular heterogeneity and therapeutic targeting in complex biological systems.

## Literature Review

The integration of lineage tracing with single-cell omics has emerged as a powerful approach to unravel the complexities of cellular development and function. Over the past decade, this combination has gained significant attention for its ability to provide high-resolution insights into cell fate decisions and heterogeneity. Recent advancements in sequencing technologies and computational methods have further enhanced the precision and scope of such studies, enabling researchers to track cellular lineages with unprecedented accuracy. This section reviews the current state of research in this rapidly evolving field, highlighting key milestones and breakthroughs. It also explores recent developments that have expanded the applicability of lineage tracing in diverse biological contexts. By synthesizing these findings, this literature review aims to establish a foundation for understanding the evolving landscape of lineage analysis in conjunction with single-cell omics.

### Current state of research

Lineage tracing integration with single-cell omics represents a transformative approach in modern biological research, enabling the reconstruction of cellular development and functional heterogeneity at unprecedented resolution. This integration has advanced significantly through the development of computational tools and experimental methodologies that bridge lineage information with high-dimensional omics data. For instance, lineage tracing techniques such as genetic labeling and CRISPR-based barcoding have been combined with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map cell fate decisions and developmental trajectories. These approaches allow researchers to track how individual cells differentiate over time and how their gene expression profiles evolve, providing critical insights into processes like organogenesis and tissue regeneration. The ability to correlate lineage relationships with molecular states is particularly valuable in understanding complex biological systems, such as the tumor microenvironment or immune responses.

A major advancement in this field is the development of computational frameworks that integrate lineage data with multi-omic datasets. Tools like MMD-MA enable the alignment of different single-cell omics measurements—such as gene expression, DNA accessibility, and chromatin organization—without requiring prior knowledge of cell identities or modality correspondences. This unsupervised manifold alignment approach facilitates the integration of heterogeneous data types, enhancing the interpretability of lineage dynamics across diverse cellular states. Similarly, ArchR provides a scalable platform for analyzing chromatin accessibility data alongside transcriptomic profiles, allowing for the identification of regulatory elements and their potential roles in lineage specification. Such integrative methods are essential for reconstructing the intricate regulatory networks that govern cell fate decisions and for identifying key drivers of cellular differentiation.

Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in the integration of lineage tracing with single-cell omics. One critical issue is the scalability of existing methods to large and complex datasets, which often require significant computational resources and sophisticated algorithms. Additionally, the accuracy of lineage inference depends heavily on the quality and resolution of both the omics data and the lineage markers used. Recent studies have highlighted the limitations of traditional lineage tracing approaches in capturing rare cell populations or dynamic transitions, suggesting a need for more robust and flexible methodologies. Future research should focus on developing hybrid models that combine parametric and non-parametric lineage inference strategies, as well as improving the integration of spatial transcriptomic data to capture the three-dimensional context of cellular development. Furthermore, the creation of standardized benchmarks and evaluation pipelines will be crucial for comparing the performance of different integration methods and ensuring reproducibility across studies. By addressing these challenges, the field can move toward a more comprehensive understanding of cellular lineage and its implications for health and disease.

### Recent Advances in Lineage Tracing with Single-Cell Multi-Omics

Recent advances in lineage tracing have been significantly enhanced by integration with single-cell multi-omics approaches, enabling more precise and comprehensive understanding of cellular development and heterogeneity. Lineage tracing, traditionally reliant on genetic markers and clonal analysis, has evolved through the incorporation of high-throughput single-cell technologies that capture transcriptomic, epigenomic, and even proteomic profiles at unprecedented resolution [10]. This synergy allows researchers to reconstruct developmental trajectories and infer cell fate decisions with greater accuracy. For instance, tools like ArchR provide scalable platforms for integrative single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis, facilitating the identification of regulatory elements and their associations with gene expression [10]. Such methodologies not only enhance the resolution of lineage relationships but also reveal the dynamic interplay between genomic features and cellular identity.

The integration of lineage tracing with multi-omics data has also addressed critical limitations in traditional approaches, such as the inability to resolve complex cellular hierarchies and the lack of molecular context for lineage relationships. By combining lineage information with single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), researchers can now map the transcriptional states of individual cells throughout development and disease progression [13]. This is particularly evident in studies of the brain, where scRNA-seq has uncovered previously unrecognized cellular diversity, including distinct subpopulations of interneurons and oligodendrocytes [13]. Furthermore, lineage tracing experiments using fluorescent reporters, such as the mT/mG mouse model, have enabled the visualization of cell lineage dynamics in both fixed and live tissues, offering insights into cellular behavior during development and homeostasis [14]. These advancements underscore the power of multi-omics approaches in providing a holistic view of cellular lineage and function.

Despite these strides, challenges remain in fully leveraging the potential of lineage tracing within multi-omics frameworks. One key limitation is the computational complexity involved in integrating diverse data types and inferring robust lineage trees from noisy or sparse datasets [10]. Additionally, while single-cell technologies can capture detailed molecular profiles, they often lack functional validation, which is essential for understanding the biological significance of observed changes. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated algorithms for lineage inference and integrating functional assays with multi-omics data. Moreover, expanding these approaches to human tissues and disease models will be critical for translating findings into clinical applications. By addressing these challenges, the integration of lineage tracing with single-cell multi-omics holds great promise for advancing our understanding of cellular development, disease mechanisms, and therapeutic strategies [16].
