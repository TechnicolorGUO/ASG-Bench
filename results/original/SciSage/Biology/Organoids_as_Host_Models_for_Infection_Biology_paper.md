## Introduction

The study of infectious diseases has long relied on traditional in vitro and animal models, yet these systems often fail to fully capture the complexity of human tissues. In recent years, organoids—three-dimensional cell culture systems derived from stem cells—have emerged as powerful tools for modeling human physiology and disease. Their ability to recapitulate the architecture, function, and genetic diversity of native tissues makes them particularly valuable in infection biology. As researchers seek more accurate and relevant models to study host-pathogen interactions, organoids offer a promising alternative that bridges the gap between conventional models and human biology. This section provides an overview of the development and application of organoids as host models, highlighting their potential to advance our understanding of infectious diseases. By examining the rationale behind their use, we set the stage for a deeper exploration of their role in modern infection research.

### Background and Applications of Organoids as Host Models in Infection Biology

Organoid-based host models have emerged as powerful tools in infection biology, offering a unique platform to study host-pathogen interactions with high physiological relevance. These three-dimensional (3D) structures, derived from stem cells or patient tissues, recapitulate the complexity of human organs and provide a more accurate representation of in vivo conditions compared to traditional two-dimensional cell cultures [2]. This technological advancement has enabled researchers to investigate the mechanisms of pathogen entry, replication, and immune evasion within a context that closely mirrors human physiology. For instance, cancer organoids have been used to model treatment responses in metastatic gastrointestinal cancers, demonstrating their utility in predicting drug efficacy and guiding personalized therapeutic strategies [3]. Such models not only enhance our understanding of disease progression but also facilitate the development of targeted interventions, making them invaluable in translational research.

The application of organoid models extends beyond cancer to a wide range of infectious diseases, including those caused by intracellular pathogens like *Coxiella burnetii* and *Acinetobacter baumannii* [4]. These pathogens exploit host cellular machinery to establish persistent infections, and organoids provide a means to dissect these interactions in a controlled environment. For example, *C. burnetii* resides within a parasitophorous vacuole, a specialized compartment that it modifies to avoid degradation by the host's lysosomal system. Organoid systems can be engineered to mimic specific tissue environments, allowing researchers to study how such pathogens manipulate host pathways for survival. Similarly, *A. baumannii*, a multidrug-resistant bacterium, has been studied using organoid models to understand its ability to colonize and persist in host tissues, particularly in immunocompromised individuals [5]. These studies highlight the versatility of organoids in investigating both bacterial virulence mechanisms and host defense strategies.

Despite their promise, organoid-based models face several challenges that limit their widespread adoption. One major limitation is the difficulty in fully replicating the heterogeneity and complexity of native tissues, which can affect the accuracy of experimental outcomes [6]. Additionally, the scalability and standardization of organoid cultures remain significant hurdles, particularly when translating findings to clinical applications. Moreover, while organoids can capture many aspects of host-pathogen interactions, they often lack key immune components, such as immune cells and cytokine networks, which are critical for understanding the full spectrum of the immune response [7]. Future research should focus on integrating immune cells into organoid systems to create more comprehensive models of infection. Advances in bioengineering, such as the use of microfluidic devices and organ-on-a-chip technologies, could further enhance the physiological fidelity of these models, enabling more precise studies of pathogenesis and therapeutic efficacy [7]. By addressing these limitations, organoid-based host models can become even more transformative in infection biology, paving the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

### Research Context and Challenges

The developmental origins of organoid-based infection models represent a transformative approach in human disease research, offering unprecedented insights into the pathogenesis of infectious diseases through the use of patient-derived three-dimensional tissue cultures. Organoids, derived from stem cells or primary tumor tissues, recapitulate the structural and functional complexity of native organs, making them ideal platforms for studying host-pathogen interactions [1]. This technology has been particularly valuable in modeling infections such as those caused by SARS-CoV-2, where organoids have enabled researchers to investigate viral entry mechanisms, replication dynamics, and immune responses in a physiologically relevant context [7]. By leveraging the molecular and cellular fidelity of organoids, scientists can simulate disease progression and test therapeutic interventions with greater accuracy than traditional two-dimensional cell cultures or animal models.

A critical advantage of organoid-based models lies in their ability to reflect individual genetic and epigenetic variability, which is essential for understanding how different populations respond to infections. For instance, cancer organoids derived from metastatic gastrointestinal tumors have been used to predict drug responses and identify biomarkers associated with treatment efficacy, thereby facilitating personalized medicine approaches [1]. Similarly, organoids generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a means to study the impact of genetic mutations on susceptibility to infectious agents, as well as the development of antiviral resistance [2]. These models also enable the investigation of host factors that influence disease severity, such as the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in modulating immune responses to pathogens [8]. Such insights are crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving clinical outcomes in diverse patient populations.

Despite their promise, organoid-based infection models face several challenges that limit their broader application. One key limitation is the difficulty in fully replicating the complexity of the human immune system within these cultures, which restricts their utility in studying immune-mediated pathologies [7]. Additionally, while organoids can mimic certain aspects of tissue architecture, they often lack the full range of cell types and extracellular matrix components found in vivo, potentially affecting their predictive power [2]. Furthermore, the scalability and standardization of organoid generation remain significant hurdles, particularly for high-throughput screening applications. Future research should focus on integrating immune cells into organoid systems to better model host-pathogen interactions and on refining protocols to enhance reproducibility and consistency. Advances in single-cell omics and computational modeling will also be critical for interpreting the vast datasets generated from these models, ultimately enabling more precise and actionable insights into the developmental origins of infectious diseases.

Over the past decade, significant advancements have been made in developing organoids that accurately mimic human tissues, offering new avenues for studying pathogen-host interactions. This review highlights key milestones and emerging trends that have shaped the current state of research, emphasizing the potential of organoids to revolutionize our understanding of infectious diseases. By examining recent studies, this section underscores the growing adoption of organoid systems as powerful tools for investigating microbial pathogenesis. It also identifies gaps in existing knowledge and sets the stage for the subsequent discussion on experimental approaches and findings. Ultimately, the literature review serves as a foundation for appreciating the transformative role of organoids in modern infection research.

### Recent Advances and Challenges in Organoid-Based Host Models

Recent advances in organoid-based host models have significantly transformed infectious disease research by providing biologically relevant, human-derived systems that recapitulate complex tissue architectures and cellular interactions. Organoids, generated from stem cells or patient-derived tissues, can mimic the structural and functional properties of native organs, offering a platform to study pathogen-host interactions with unprecedented fidelity [1]. These models are particularly valuable for investigating diseases where traditional two-dimensional cell cultures or animal models fail to capture human-specific responses. For instance, cancer organoids derived from metastatic gastrointestinal tumors have been used to model drug response and predict clinical outcomes, demonstrating their utility in personalized medicine and therapeutic development [2]. The ability to generate organoids from patient samples further enhances their relevance, as they can reflect individual genetic and epigenetic variations that influence disease progression and treatment efficacy.

Despite their promise, organoid models face several challenges that limit their widespread application in infectious disease research. One major limitation is the incomplete representation of immune cell interactions, which are critical for understanding host-pathogen dynamics. While some studies have incorporated immune cells into organoid systems, these approaches remain technically challenging and often lack the complexity of in vivo immune responses [1]. Additionally, the long-term stability and reproducibility of organoid cultures vary depending on the tissue source and culture conditions, raising concerns about experimental consistency. Another key issue is the limited capacity of current organoid models to fully replicate the microenvironment of infected tissues, including factors such as oxygen gradients, mechanical forces, and microbial communities. These limitations underscore the need for further technological advancements to enhance the physiological accuracy and functional diversity of organoid systems.

Looking ahead, future research should focus on integrating multi-omics data with organoid platforms to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying infectious diseases. Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics could enable more precise characterization of cellular heterogeneity within organoids, facilitating the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Moreover, the development of organ-on-a-chip technologies that combine organoids with microfluidic systems may help simulate dynamic physiological conditions and improve the predictive power of these models. Addressing these challenges will require interdisciplinary collaboration between stem cell biologists, immunologists, bioengineers, and computational scientists. By overcoming these barriers, organoid-based host models have the potential to become a cornerstone of infectious disease research, enabling more effective drug discovery, vaccine development, and personalized treatment strategies [1].

### Current state of organoid-based host models in infection biology

The current state of organoid-based host models in infection biology research reflects a transformative shift in how researchers study host-pathogen interactions, offering unprecedented opportunities to model complex biological processes with high physiological relevance. Organoids, derived from stem cells or patient tissues, recapitulate the structural and functional complexity of native organs, making them ideal platforms for investigating infectious diseases [1]. These models have been particularly valuable in studying gastrointestinal infections, as demonstrated by their application in modeling metastatic cancers and predicting drug responses [3]. In the context of infection biology, organoids provide a unique advantage over traditional two-dimensional cell cultures by preserving tissue architecture, cellular heterogeneity, and intercellular signaling pathways that are critical for pathogen entry, replication, and immune evasion.

A key strength of organoid models lies in their ability to integrate both parametric and non-parametric knowledge, as they can be genetically modified to introduce specific mutations or transgenes (parametric) while also being exposed to external pathogens or environmental factors (non-parametric). This dual capability enables researchers to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying host susceptibility and resistance to infections. For instance, studies on *Coxiella burnetii* have highlighted the importance of vacuolar niche formation and autophagy modulation in bacterial survival [2], insights that could be further explored using organoid systems to simulate the intracellular environment. Similarly, the role of the gut microbiota in modulating immune responses and influencing pathogen virulence has been extensively studied [4], but organoid models offer a more direct way to investigate these interactions in a controlled, physiologically relevant setting. However, while organoids capture many aspects of in vivo physiology, they often lack immune cell infiltration and vascularization, which are essential for a complete understanding of host-pathogen dynamics [1].

Despite their promise, organoid-based models face several challenges that limit their widespread adoption in infection biology research. One major limitation is the difficulty in maintaining long-term cultures that accurately reflect the dynamic nature of host-pathogen interactions. Additionally, the variability in organoid generation from different patient sources can introduce confounding factors, necessitating rigorous standardization protocols [1]. Another critical issue is the limited capacity of current organoid systems to fully replicate the complexity of the human immune system, which is crucial for studying immunopathology and vaccine responses. Future research should focus on integrating immune cells into organoid models and developing advanced imaging and single-cell sequencing technologies to enhance spatial and temporal resolution. Furthermore, the development of organ-on-a-chip systems that combine organoids with microfluidic environments could provide even more realistic models of infection, bridging the gap between in vitro and in vivo studies [1]. By addressing these challenges, organoid-based host models have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of infectious diseases and accelerate the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
