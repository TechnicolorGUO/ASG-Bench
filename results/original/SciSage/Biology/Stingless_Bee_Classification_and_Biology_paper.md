## Introduction

Stingless bees, a diverse group of social insects belonging to the tribe Meliponini, play a vital role in pollination and ecosystem stability across tropical and subtropical regions. Despite their ecological importance, these bees remain relatively understudied compared to their honeybee counterparts, leading to gaps in both their classification and biological understanding. This section provides an overview of the current state of research on stingless bee classification and biology, highlighting the challenges and advancements in this field. By examining their taxonomic diversity and unique biological traits, we gain insight into their evolutionary adaptations and ecological significance. Understanding stingless bees is not only crucial for biodiversity conservation but also for sustainable agriculture, as they contribute significantly to plant pollination. This introduction sets the stage for a deeper exploration of their classification systems, morphological characteristics, and behavioral patterns. Through this discussion, we aim to underscore the need for continued research and conservation efforts focused on these fascinating yet often overlooked pollinators.

### Research significance

Stingless bees play a pivotal role in pollination ecosystems, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions, where they contribute significantly to both wild plant reproduction and agricultural productivity. Unlike their more widely studied honey bee counterparts, stingless bees are often overlooked in conservation discourse despite their ecological importance. Research indicates that these bees are highly effective pollinators of a wide range of plant species, including many that are critical for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem function [4]. For instance, studies on tropical forest fragmentation have shown that stingless bees, particularly tree-nesting meliponines, are more prevalent in larger forest fragments with lower edge-to-area ratios, suggesting their sensitivity to habitat structure and landscape configuration [1]. This pattern aligns with broader findings that pollinator communities are strongly influenced by spatial and temporal factors, such as the availability of floral resources and the degree of habitat connectivity [10]. The presence of stingless bees in fragmented landscapes underscores their potential as bioindicators of ecosystem health, as their abundance and diversity can reflect the integrity of the surrounding environment.

The ecological significance of stingless bees extends beyond their direct pollination services, as they also interact with other components of the ecosystem, influencing plant community dynamics and supporting food webs. Their role in pollinating native flora, including orchids and other specialized plant species, is crucial for maintaining the structural and functional complexity of tropical ecosystems [1]. Moreover, stingless bees are known to exhibit distinct foraging behaviors and resource preferences, which may reduce competition with other pollinators and enhance overall pollination efficiency [4]. However, their vulnerability to environmental stressors, such as habitat loss, pesticide exposure, and climate change, poses significant threats to their populations and the ecosystem services they provide [13]. This is particularly concerning given the global decline in pollinator populations, which has been linked to reduced crop yields and diminished biodiversity [5]. Conservation strategies that prioritize the protection of native bee species, including stingless bees, are therefore essential for sustaining both natural and agricultural ecosystems.

From a conservation perspective, the preservation of stingless bee populations necessitates a multifaceted approach that integrates landscape-scale planning with local-level interventions. One key challenge is the lack of comprehensive data on the distribution and ecological requirements of many stingless bee species, which hinders targeted conservation efforts [4]. Additionally, the interplay between land-use changes and pollinator dynamics remains poorly understood, particularly in regions where agricultural expansion and deforestation are rampant [8]. Future research should focus on elucidating the specific ecological roles of different stingless bee species, as well as the impacts of anthropogenic pressures on their populations. Developing adaptive management strategies that incorporate traditional ecological knowledge and community-based conservation initiatives could also enhance the effectiveness of these efforts [16]. By addressing these gaps, researchers and policymakers can better safeguard the vital contributions of stingless bees to pollination ecosystems and biodiversity conservation.

### Background and Methodology in Stingless Bee Classification and Biology

The systematics and phylogeny of stingless bees have been investigated through both morphological and molecular approaches, each offering distinct insights into their evolutionary relationships and taxonomic classification. Morphological analysis has historically dominated the study of stingless bee taxonomy, relying on external and internal anatomical features to delineate genera and species. This approach has yielded a comprehensive inventory of Brazilian stingless bee species, with 242 described species and approximately 85 new ones identified across 29 genera [2]. However, morphological traits can be subject to convergence and homoplasy, potentially obscuring true phylogenetic relationships. In contrast, molecular methods provide a more direct means of inferring evolutionary history by analyzing genetic sequences, which are less prone to such confounding factors. Recent studies have highlighted the utility of molecular data in resolving deeper phylogenetic relationships among stingless bees, particularly when combined with morphological evidence to corroborate findings [3].

Molecular phylogenetics has advanced significantly with the development of sophisticated software tools that enable robust maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses. Programs such as RAxML, IQ-TREE, and FastTree have become essential for constructing large-scale phylogenies, offering improved speed and accuracy in tree estimation [4]. These tools incorporate advanced substitution models and optimization algorithms, allowing researchers to handle complex datasets with high computational efficiency. For instance, RAxML-VI-HPC has demonstrated superior performance in handling datasets with thousands of taxa, reducing memory requirements while maintaining tree quality [5]. Similarly, IQ-TREE employs stochastic algorithms to explore tree space effectively, achieving higher likelihoods than competing programs in many benchmark tests [6]. Such advancements have facilitated the integration of molecular data into stingless bee systematics, enabling more precise classification and the identification of previously unrecognized clades.

Despite these advances, challenges remain in reconciling morphological and molecular classifications, particularly in cases where genetic data do not align with traditional taxonomic groupings. This discrepancy may arise from incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization, or insufficient sampling of key taxa. Additionally, the choice of phylogenetic methods and models can influence the resulting topology, necessitating careful validation through multiple analytical approaches. The use of model-averaging techniques, such as those implemented in jModelTest, can help mitigate model uncertainty by considering multiple substitution models simultaneously [7]. Future research should prioritize the integration of multi-locus molecular data with detailed morphological assessments, leveraging next-generation sequencing technologies to generate high-resolution phylogenies [8]. Furthermore, the application of Bayesian methods, such as those supported by Tracer 1.7, can enhance the interpretation of posterior distributions and improve the reliability of phylogenetic inferences [9]. By combining these approaches, researchers can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of stingless bee systematics, ultimately refining their classification and elucidating their evolutionary history.

## Literature Review and Research Trends

The section on Literature Review provides an overview of the current state of research on stingless bees, highlighting the evolving understanding of their classification and biological characteristics. Over the past few decades, studies have increasingly focused on the diversity and ecological roles of these important pollinators. Recent developments in molecular taxonomy have significantly enhanced our ability to classify and differentiate species, revealing previously unrecognized relationships within the group. This review synthesizes key findings from recent publications, emphasizing advancements in both systematic biology and behavioral ecology. By examining the trajectory of scientific inquiry, this section sets the stage for a deeper exploration of stingless bee biology and its implications for conservation and agriculture. It also identifies gaps in existing knowledge that warrant further investigation.

### Current State of Research and Knowledge Gaps

The current state of research on stingless bee classification and biological characteristics reflects a growing but still fragmented scientific landscape, with significant progress in taxonomic clarification and ecological understanding, yet persistent gaps in phylogenetic resolution and functional biology [16]. The classification of stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini) has benefited from integrative approaches combining morphological, molecular, and genomic data, yet challenges remain in resolving deep-level relationships and defining monophyletic groups. Recent studies employing transcriptome sequencing and ultraconserved elements (UCEs) have provided robust phylogenetic frameworks, clarifying contentious nodes such as the monophyly of orchid bees (Euglossini) and the placement of enigmatic cleptoparasitic genera like Ctenoplectra and Tetrapedia [1][8]. However, these analyses often rely on limited taxon sampling, particularly for understudied regions like Brazil, where over 240 described species and approximately 85 new species are recorded [17]. This suggests that the true diversity of stingless bees remains underestimated, highlighting the need for more comprehensive, geographically diverse sampling to refine higher-level classifications.

Biologically, stingless bees exhibit a range of unique traits that distinguish them from their honeybee relatives, including complex social structures, specialized nest-building behaviors, and distinct microbiome compositions. Research has shown that their gut microbial communities are shaped by host evolutionary history, suggesting co-evolutionary dynamics between bees and their symbiotic microbes [18]. Additionally, studies on the effects of habitat fragmentation reveal that stingless bee communities are highly sensitive to landscape changes, with tree-nesting species showing stronger associations with larger forest fragments compared to introduced Apis mellifera [19]. These findings underscore the ecological importance of stingless bees as pollinators, particularly in tropical ecosystems, where they contribute significantly to plant reproduction and biodiversity maintenance [20]. However, the mechanisms underlying their ecological resilience and the extent of their functional roles in different habitats remain underexplored, limiting our ability to predict their responses to ongoing environmental changes [8].

Despite these advances, several critical knowledge gaps persist in the study of stingless bees. Taxonomically, many species remain undescribed or poorly characterized, and the integration of molecular data with traditional morphological taxonomy is still in its early stages [9]. Functionally, the physiological adaptations that enable stingless bees to thrive in diverse environments—such as their thermoregulatory strategies, resource allocation patterns, and interactions with floral communities—are not yet fully understood [10]. Moreover, the potential applications of stingless bee products, such as honey with unique antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, have only begun to be explored [11]. Future research should prioritize large-scale, multi-omics studies that integrate phylogenetics, ecology, and genomics to address these gaps. Such efforts would not only enhance our understanding of stingless bee biology but also inform conservation strategies and sustainable utilization of their ecological services in agricultural and natural systems [12].

### Recent Advances in Stingless Bee Taxonomy and Ecology

Recent advancements in stingless bee taxonomy and life history research have significantly enhanced our understanding of these ecologically and economically important insects, particularly in the context of their biodiversity, microbial interactions, and ecological roles [16]. Taxonomic studies have expanded the known diversity of stingless bees, with Brazil alone documenting 242 described species and approximately 85 new ones across 29 genera. This detailed inventory highlights the importance of regional collections such as the Camargo Collection (RPSP) in preserving and analyzing morphological and taxonomic data. However, the field remains challenged by taxonomic inconsistencies, as evidenced by incongruent nomenclature among curators even at the phylum level, a problem that persists despite efforts to standardize classifications through databases like Greengenes [1]. The integration of molecular tools, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing and Bayesian classifiers like the RDP Classifier, has further refined taxonomic accuracy, enabling more precise classification of bacterial communities associated with stingless bees [8].

The life history and ecological roles of stingless bees have also been the focus of recent research, particularly regarding their microbiome dynamics and ecological significance. Studies on the gut microbiomes of social bees, including stingless bees, reveal shared microbial communities shaped by host evolutionary history, suggesting conserved symbiotic relationships across different bee taxa [17]. These microbial associations are crucial for various biological functions, including nutrient processing and immune response, which may influence the survival and adaptability of stingless bee populations. Additionally, research on the effects of forest fragmentation on bee communities underscores the ecological importance of stingless bees, particularly tree-nesting meliponines, which are strongly associated with larger forest fragments and exhibit distinct community compositions compared to those in agricultural landscapes [18]. This highlights the need for conservation strategies that prioritize native forest preservation to maintain the ecological services provided by these bees, such as pollination and ecosystem stability.

Despite these advances, several gaps remain in stingless bee research, particularly in the areas of functional ecology and long-term population dynamics. While studies have documented the antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties of honey produced by both honey bees and stingless bees, the specific mechanisms underlying these effects and their implications for human health require further investigation [19]. Moreover, the impact of climate change and habitat alteration on stingless bee populations is not yet fully understood, necessitating longitudinal studies that integrate ecological, genetic, and microbiological data [20]. Future research should also explore the role of stingless bees in plant-fungal endophyte interactions, as these symbioses can influence plant fitness and community structure [8]. By addressing these knowledge gaps, researchers can develop more effective conservation strategies and harness the ecological and economic potential of stingless bees in sustainable agriculture and biodiversity management.
