## Introduction

In an era increasingly shaped by digital technologies, the role of digital competence in education has become a critical area of focus for educators, policymakers, and researchers. As digital tools continue to transform how knowledge is created, shared, and accessed, the need for individuals to develop essential digital skills has never been more urgent. This paper explores the concept of digital competence within educational contexts, examining its significance in preparing learners for the demands of the modern world. The growing integration of technology in classrooms and beyond underscores the importance of understanding not only how digital tools can enhance learning, but also how educators and students can effectively navigate and leverage these resources. This introduction sets the stage for a deeper analysis of the challenges and opportunities associated with fostering digital competence in education.

### Research gap and theoretical challenges

Digital competence in education research has emerged as a critical area of inquiry, driven by the increasing integration of digital technologies into teaching and learning processes. The concept encompasses not only technical skills but also the ability to critically engage with digital tools, adapt to evolving technological landscapes, and foster 21st-century competencies among learners. Despite growing interest, significant theoretical framework gaps persist, particularly in defining the scope, components, and pedagogical implications of digital competence. While frameworks such as the European Digital Competence Framework for Educators (DigCompEdu) and the Teacher Digital Competency (TDC) framework provide structured approaches, they often lack sufficient conceptual depth to address the dynamic and interdisciplinary nature of digital literacy in educational contexts. These models tend to prioritize technical proficiency over critical engagement, leaving underexplored the socio-cultural and ethical dimensions of digital competence.

The literature reveals a notable absence of unified definitions and operationalizations of digital competence, which hinders comparative analysis and empirical validation. A systematic review of higher education research highlights that definitions vary significantly depending on whether they are shaped by policy, institutional needs, or disciplinary perspectives, resulting in fragmented conceptualizations that fail to capture the complexity of digital practices. This inconsistency is further exacerbated by the reliance on narrow, subject-specific technical knowledge, which does not adequately prepare educators for the multifaceted demands of contemporary classrooms. For instance, while the professional digital competence (PDC) of newly qualified teachers is increasingly recognized as essential, studies indicate that initial teacher education programs often fall short in providing meaningful opportunities for developing this competence, leading to perceived gaps in self-efficacy and preparedness [2]. Such findings underscore the need for more comprehensive theoretical models that account for both the technical and pedagogical dimensions of digital competence.

Future research should prioritize the development of integrative theoretical frameworks that bridge the gap between digital literacy and digital competence, emphasizing their interdependence and contextual variability. This requires moving beyond simplistic dichotomies of technical skill versus critical thinking, and instead adopting a more nuanced understanding of how digital competence is constructed, enacted, and assessed across different educational settings. Additionally, there is a pressing need for empirical studies that explore the relationship between digital competence and student outcomes, as well as the role of institutional and policy factors in shaping its development [3][4]. By addressing these theoretical and methodological challenges, researchers can contribute to the creation of more robust and actionable frameworks that support educators in navigating the complexities of digital pedagogy.

### Background and Evolution of Digital Competence in Education

The evolution of digital competence in education reflects a dynamic interplay between pedagogical integration and technological impact, necessitating a reconfiguration of teacher competencies to align with 21st-century educational demands. The Teacher Digital Competency (TDC) framework, introduced as an expanded view of digital competence, emphasizes the need for a holistic understanding that goes beyond technical skills to encompass ethical, safe, and productive engagement in digitally-mediated environments [1]. This conceptualization challenges traditional models that have primarily focused on students’ use of educational applications or the integration of technology into teaching practices. Instead, it advocates for an interdisciplinary approach where all faculty members must engage deliberately in delivering objectives that prepare students for the complexities of modern classrooms. The European Digital Competence Framework for Educators (DigCompEdu) further supports this by providing a structured model that addresses micro-level professional development, meso-level institutional collaboration, and macro-level quality assurance [2]. These frameworks highlight the necessity of aligning teacher competencies with evolving technological landscapes while ensuring that pedagogical strategies remain adaptive and inclusive.

Pedagogical integration of technology is increasingly recognized as a critical component of digital competence, yet its implementation remains inconsistent across educational contexts. Research indicates that while global investments in information and communication technology (ICT) have been substantial, the adoption and integration of these tools into teaching practices are often limited by personal, institutional, and technological barriers [4]. Factors such as lack of teacher skills, insufficient pedagogical training, and rigid curricula hinder effective ICT utilization, underscoring the need for targeted professional development programs. The Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework offers a valuable lens for understanding how teachers can integrate technology meaningfully into their instructional practices [5]. By emphasizing the interplay between technological knowledge, pedagogical strategies, and content expertise, TPACK provides a foundation for developing teacher education programs that foster deeper integration. However, existing research suggests that while TPACK has shown promise, there remain gaps in its application, particularly in cross-disciplinary contexts and in addressing the diverse needs of students [5]. These findings point to the importance of creating more flexible and context-sensitive approaches to digital competence development.

The technological impact on education extends beyond classroom practices, influencing broader systemic changes and requiring a re-evaluation of digital literacy and competence definitions. A systematic review of higher education research reveals that digital competence and digital literacy are often used interchangeably, yet their definitions vary significantly depending on policy, disciplinary focus, and contextual factors [7]. This variability complicates efforts to establish coherent frameworks for teacher education and institutional policy. Furthermore, the rise of gamification and other innovative digital tools presents both opportunities and challenges for educators seeking to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes [8]. While gamification can effectively motivate learners through elements like badges and competition, its successful implementation requires careful pedagogical design and infrastructure support. The integration of digital technologies also raises concerns about data privacy, cybersecurity, and the equitable access to resources, which must be addressed to ensure that digital competence initiatives do not exacerbate existing educational disparities [9]. Future research should focus on developing context-specific models that account for these multifaceted challenges, while also exploring the long-term impacts of digital competence on student learning and teacher professional growth. Such efforts will be crucial in shaping a future where technology serves as a catalyst for inclusive, equitable, and transformative educational practices.

## Literature Review

The section on Digital Competence in Education begins with a comprehensive Literature Review that examines recent developments and the current state of research in the field. As digital technologies continue to reshape educational landscapes, understanding how educators and students navigate this evolving environment has become increasingly important. This review synthesizes key findings from contemporary studies, highlighting emerging trends and persistent challenges. It also identifies gaps in existing research, providing a foundation for the analysis that follows. By situating the discussion within the broader context of educational innovation, this section aims to clarify the significance of digital competence in modern learning environments. The insights presented here inform the subsequent exploration of theoretical frameworks and practical implications.

### Recent Developments in Digital Competence Frameworks

Recent advancements in digital competence frameworks for educational practice reflect a growing recognition of the need to equip educators with the skills and knowledge required to navigate increasingly complex, technology-mediated learning environments. These frameworks have evolved from narrow technical skill-based models to more holistic, interdisciplinary approaches that emphasize not only technological proficiency but also pedagogical innovation, ethical considerations, and the ability to foster digital citizenship [2]. The European Digital Competence Framework for Educators (DigCompEdu), for instance, represents a paradigmatic shift by aligning teacher competencies with 21st-century challenges, such as the integration of digital tools into pedagogy and the promotion of students' digital literacy [1]. This framework is designed to be adaptable across institutional contexts while maintaining a strong focus on continuous professional development at both micro and macro levels.

A critical analysis of these frameworks reveals both methodological strengths and persistent limitations. While DigCompEdu and similar models provide a structured approach to identifying and developing digital competencies, they often lack specificity in addressing the diverse needs of different educational sectors and learner populations [10]. For example, the conceptualization of digital competence remains inconsistent across disciplines, with some frameworks emphasizing technical skills and others prioritizing social practices or policy-driven objectives [10]. This inconsistency complicates the implementation of standardized training programs and hinders the development of universally applicable assessment criteria. Moreover, many frameworks fail to account for the dynamic nature of digital technologies, which evolve rapidly and require ongoing adaptation of competencies [13].

To address these gaps, future research should prioritize the development of context-sensitive, iterative frameworks that incorporate feedback loops from educators and learners. Such frameworks could integrate real-time data on emerging technologies and pedagogical trends, ensuring their relevance in an ever-changing landscape. Additionally, there is a need for more empirical studies examining the effectiveness of digital competence initiatives in improving teaching practices and student outcomes. By bridging the gap between theoretical models and practical application, researchers can contribute to the creation of robust, scalable solutions that support educators in leveraging digital tools to enhance learning experiences [12].

### State of Research on Digital Competence in Education

Digital competence in education has undergone significant changes from 2010 to 2024, mirroring broader societal trends toward integrating technology into learning environments. Early research centered on technical skills and the use of digital tools for instruction, whereas recent studies highlight a more comprehensive view that includes critical thinking, ethical considerations, and adaptive problem-solving. This evolution is reflected in frameworks such as the European Digital Competence Framework for Educators (DigCompEdu), which views digital competence as a multifaceted construct requiring both pedagogical and technological knowledge [1]. However, there is still no agreement on how to effectively operationalize and assess digital competence, with definitions differing across policy documents, disciplines, and regions.

A review of the literature identifies ongoing methodological and conceptual challenges in digital competence research. Many studies use self-reported measures or limited indicators that do not fully capture the complexity of digital practices in real educational settings. For example, while DigCompEdu offers structured guidelines, it often lacks empirical validation and fails to address the dynamic nature of digital environments [3]. The field has also been criticized for focusing too much on technological aspects, overlooking social, cultural, and institutional factors that influence digital competence development. This is especially relevant in higher education, where digital tool integration is frequently fragmented and disconnected from broader pedagogical objectives [10]. Moreover, the rise of AI-driven technologies like generative conversational models has introduced new concerns regarding authenticity, bias, and the decline of critical thinking, yet these issues remain underexplored.

Future research should focus on interdisciplinary approaches that connect theoretical, empirical, and practical aspects of digital competence. One potential area is the creation of context-sensitive assessment tools that reflect the varied ways educators and learners interact with digital technologies across different educational levels and cultural contexts. Another important area is examining the role of institutional policies and leadership in promoting digital competence, especially as personalized and adaptive learning environments become more prevalent. Longitudinal studies are also needed to track the development of digital competence over time, considering both individual and systemic influences. Finally, researchers should investigate the impact of emerging technologies, such as immersive virtual reality and the metaverse, on redefining digital competence in education, ensuring that future frameworks are inclusive and responsive to technological advancements [11].
