      "content": "Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) represents a significant public health concern, characterized by the deliberate, direct destruction of body tissue without suicidal intent [[4]]. It is a behavior with profound biological underpinnings that unfolds across multiple temporal scales, from acute neurochemical shifts to developmental trajectories spanning decades. The lifetime prevalence of NSSI among adolescents is estimated at 18-23%, with rates in young adults around 13% and a peak onset typically occurring between the ages of 12 and 15 years [[4,6,10]]. While historical data have shown higher rates of NSSI among females, recent studies suggest a more equal prevalence between males and females, though gender differences in methods persist, with males more likely to engage in hitting or fighting as proxy self-injury, while females more often cut or scratch [[4]]. This behavior is not benign; approximately 20% of cases persist for over five years, and it is strongly associated with other severe mental health conditions, including borderline personality disorder (BPD), bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) [[2,4,6]]. For instance, individuals with BPD have an 80% likelihood of engaging in NSSI, and 65-80% of those with BPD meet criteria for NSSI [[4]].\n\nThe motivation for this review is to advance a comprehensive understanding of the biology of NSSI by organizing the existing evidence within a temporal framework. This approach allows for a systematic analysis of how biological factors interact and change over time, from immediate responses to chronic dysregulation. The primary objectives are threefold: first, to define the key biological systems implicated in NSSI across different timescales, including genetic predispositions, neuroendocrine responses, neurotransmitter imbalances, and structural brain changes; second, to trace the historical development of research in this field, highlighting pivotal milestones and shifts in conceptualization; and third, to critically analyze the current state-of-the-art methodologies used to study these biological processes. By synthesizing this information, we aim to identify critical gaps in the literature and chart a course for future research that can better illuminate the dynamic nature of this complex behavior. This temporal perspective is crucial for moving beyond static snapshots of pathology towards a more nuanced, process-oriented model that can inform early intervention and personalized treatment strategies."

      "level": 2,
      "content": "A precise understanding of the core concepts and definitions surrounding nonsuicidal self-injury is fundamental to interpreting the biological research conducted in this area. NSSI is broadly defined as the deliberate, direct destruction or alteration of healthy body tissue, resulting in significant damage, without conscious suicidal intent [[4]]. Common methods include cutting (the most prevalent, reported in 70–90% of cases), head banging or hitting (21–44%), and burning (15–35%) [[4]]. The diagnostic landscape for NSSI has evolved significantly, reflecting a growing consensus on its clinical importance. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), introduced a proposed diagnosis of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury Disorder (NSSID) in Section III, intended for further study [[4,10]]. The DSM-5 criteria for NSSID require that the individual has engaged in intentional self-inflicted bodily harm on five or more days in the past year, the behavior is not socially sanctioned, and it causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning [[2,4]]. The disorder also requires that the self-injury does not occur during psychosis, substance intoxication, or another mental disorder unless it represents a significant exacerbation of that condition [[2]]. More recently, the DSM-5-TR has moved the disorder out of Section III and into the main manual, assigning it the ICD-10-CM code R45.88 [[6]].\n\nDespite the formalization of these criteria, there is ongoing debate regarding their validity and utility. Research suggests that the frequency threshold of five or more incidents in a year may be too lenient, with some suggesting a cutoff of at least ten days may improve clinical validity [[9]]. Furthermore, Criterion B, which focuses on the function of NSSI to relieve negative affect or solve interpersonal problems, shows limited utility as a diagnostic tool, with studies reporting that 87.8% to 99% of adolescents endorse at least one function for their behavior, rendering it a poor discriminator [[2,9]]. In contrast, Criterion E, \"clinically significant distress or functional impairment,\" has been found to be the most robust indicator of clinical severity and is effective in differentiating between those with and without the disorder [[2,9]]. The reliability of assessing these criteria has improved with the development of structured diagnostic interviews like the Clinician-Administered NSSI Disorder Index (CANDI), which demonstrates good interrater reliability and adequate internal consistency [[2]].\n\nThe functions of NSSI provide a critical psychological lens through which to understand the behavior, many of which have potential biological correlates. The four-function model, developed by Nock and Prinstein, categorizes NSSI functions into Automatic-Negative (e.g., to regulate negative affect), Automatic-Positive (e.g., to experience positive sensations like numbness), Social-Negative (e.g., to escape an aversive situation), and Social-Positive (e.g., to gain social support) [[6]]. Ecological momentary assessment studies consistently show that NSSI is preceded by high-arousal negative emotions and followed by a feeling of relief, providing strong support for intrapersonal negative reinforcement via an automatic-negative function [[6]]. The Benefits and Barriers Model posits that most people could theoretically benefit from NSSI but are deterred by physiological, psychological, and social barriers; in individuals who engage in NSSI, these perceived benefits outweigh the barriers [[6]]. These frameworks are essential for contextualizing biological findings, such as altered reward processing in the striatum, which might explain why some individuals perceive a \"benefit\" from the act [[18]], or how prefrontal cortex dysfunction impairs the ability to resist impulses despite knowing the long-term negative consequences [[23]]."

      "content": "The scientific inquiry into the biological foundations of nonsuicidal self-injury has undergone a remarkable transformation, shifting from sparse observations to a sophisticated, multi-system investigation. The historical trajectory reflects broader advancements in neuroscience, genetics, and psychopharmacology. In the early stages of research, NSSI was often conflated with suicide attempts or dismissed as a manipulative behavior, with little focus on its unique biological signature. However, the late 20th and early 21st centuries marked a pivotal shift toward viewing NSSI as a distinct clinical phenomenon with underlying biological vulnerabilities. A major milestone in this evolution was the inclusion of NSSI Disorder as a proposed diagnosis in the DSM-5, which catalyzed a wave of research aimed at validating its clinical utility and exploring its etiological roots [[8,10]]. This formal recognition provided researchers with a standardized definition and set of criteria, facilitating more rigorous and comparable studies.\n\nThe advent of advanced neuroimaging techniques was another transformative milestone. Longitudinal designs, which were rare in the early 2000s, began to replace cross-sectional case-control studies, allowing researchers to move beyond static comparisons and explore developmental trajectories and predictors of NSSI [[4,10]]. The use of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) became a key innovation, enabling the non-invasive measurement of brain metabolites like N-acetylaspartate (NAA), glutamate, and glutamine [[17,19]]. These tools allowed scientists to investigate the neurochemical environment of specific brain regions implicated in emotion regulation and impulse control, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) [[15,23]]. Similarly, the development of structured diagnostic interviews like the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI) and the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI) provided more reliable and consistent methods for assessing NSSI frequency, method, and function, enhancing the quality of correlational data linking behavior to biological markers [[4,8]].\n\nMore recent developments have pushed the boundaries of biological research even further, incorporating novel technologies and analytical approaches. The application of machine learning algorithms to biological datasets represents a significant leap forward. Studies have begun using logistic regression and gradient boosted trees to build predictive models for identifying individuals with NSSI based on a combination of neurobiological markers, achieving moderate performance (AUC 0.67–0.72) [[5,25]]. This signals a move away from simply identifying correlations towards developing more sophisticated, data-driven models of risk. Perhaps the most innovative recent work involves the use of artificial intelligence in a fundamentally new way. A 2025 study developed a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to model the systemic dynamics of NSSI using single-channel EEG data from adolescent females [[21]]. This GNN-based 'Functional-Energetic Topology Model' did not just classify states but uncovered a key feedback loop reversal in the network structure of individuals with NSSI, suggesting the condition arises from a systemic dysregulation rather than a simple linear cascade of events [[21]]. This analytical approach, combined with the exponential growth in research publications since 2021 driven by the pandemic and advances in big data analysis, points to a future where network science and AI will be central to understanding the complex, dynamic biology of NSSI [[22]]."

      "content": "The contemporary investigation of the biological basis of nonsuicidal self-injury relies on a diverse and rapidly evolving toolkit of methods designed to probe various facets of human physiology and psychology. These techniques span molecular biology, neuroimaging, and behavioral science, each offering a unique window into the mechanisms underlying NSSI. At the molecular level, research primarily focuses on genetic predispositions and immune system activity. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have estimated the SNP heritability of NSSI to be around 10%, indicating a modest but significant genetic contribution [[3]]. Specific gene polymorphisms have been identified as risk factors, including variants in the *TPH* (tryptophan hydroxylase), *COMT*, and *SLC1A3* genes [[3]]. Epigenetic studies have added another layer of complexity, identifying abnormal methylation patterns in genes like *POMC* and *SIRT1* in adolescents with NSSI [[3]]. On the immunological front, blood biomarkers such as leukocyte counts, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are used to assess inflammation and immune activation. Cross-sectional studies have found significantly higher absolute leukocyte counts and a higher leukocyte/cortisol ratio in female adolescents with NSSI compared to healthy controls, a finding potentially mediated by childhood maltreatment and depression [[7]].\n\nNeuroimaging stands as a cornerstone of modern biological research on NSSI, with two main modalities providing distinct insights. Structural MRI is used to examine brain anatomy, revealing consistent findings of reduced gray matter volume in critical regions for emotional and cognitive control, such as the insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and inferior frontal gyrus [[3,18]]. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) complements these findings by assessing white matter microstructure, showing atypical integrity in tracts connecting these regions, such as the uncinate fasciculus [[18]]. Functional MRI (fMRI) moves beyond structure to measure brain activity and connectivity. Task-based fMRI studies have shown altered activation in response to emotional stimuli (e.g., increased amygdala activation), social exclusion (e.g., hypoactivation in reward centers), and reward anticipation [[3,18]]. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fcMRI) reveals disruptions in large-scale brain networks, particularly decreased resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, a pathway critical for emotion regulation [[3,18]]. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) provides a powerful method for quantifying specific brain metabolites directly, allowing for the assessment of neuronal health (NAA), excitatory neurotransmission (glutamate), and glial cell activity (myo-inositol) within these same regions [[15,17,19]].\n\nIn addition to these deep-dive biological methods, researchers increasingly employ sophisticated longitudinal and real-time assessment techniques to capture the temporal dynamics of NSSI. Longitudinal studies, following participants over several months or years, are essential for mapping developmental trajectories and identifying predictors of NSSI onset and persistence [[10,11]]. The duration of these follow-ups varies widely, with studies on NSSI averaging around 19.5 months and those on deliberate self-harm (DSH) averaging nearly six years, highlighting the need for longer-term investigations [[10]]. To overcome the limitations of retrospective self-report, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) using diary cards or electronic monitoring enables real-time tracking of behaviors, thoughts, and feelings, providing rich data on the immediate antecedents and consequences of an NSSI episode [[4,6]]. Finally, the integration of computational methods marks a frontier in methodology. Machine learning algorithms are being applied to predict NSSI status from complex biological datasets, while novel approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are used to model the intricate, systemic feedback loops that may characterize the neural architecture of individuals with NSSI [[5,21]]. These advanced techniques collectively allow for a far more dynamic and holistic understanding of the biological processes involved in NSSI."

      "content": "The theoretical insights generated from biological research on nonsuicidal self-injury are increasingly being translated into practical applications, from refining diagnostic tools to informing novel therapeutic strategies. One of the most direct applications is in pharmacotherapy, where biological models guide the search for effective medications. While traditional selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have not been shown to reduce NSSI, a biological understanding of the role of opioid systems has led to promising preliminary results with naltrexone, an opioid antagonist [[6]]. Further, metabolomic studies have suggested that targeting the purine metabolism pathway with drugs like allopurinol or febuxostat could be a potential add-on therapy for patients with bipolar disorder and comorbid NSSI, a population at particularly high risk [[1,12]]. The identification of specific biological markers also holds promise for diagnostics. A machine learning model developed by Mürner-Lavanchy et al. (2024) successfully classified female adolescents with NSSI using a panel of biological markers, achieving a moderate Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.69 [[5]]. The strongest predictors in this model were low oxytocin levels, low pain sensitivity, and high leukocyte counts, suggesting these could form the basis of a future biological screening tool, though the authors rightly note that longitudinal validation is required [[5]].\n\nCase studies provide a granular view of how these biological factors manifest in individuals. For example, a 2022 proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) study of Chinese adolescents with bipolar depression revealed a specific metabolic signature associated with co-occurring NSSI [[17]]. Patients with both conditions showed significantly lower N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) ratios in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) compared to those with bipolar depression alone, suggesting localized neuronal dysfunction [[17]]. Another case study focusing on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in adolescents demonstrated how trauma impacts biological regulation. In a sample of adolescents with NSSI, a trauma interview led to a significant decrease in salivary cortisol, indicating an impaired stress response, yet these same individuals had significantly higher hair cortisol levels, pointing to chronically elevated basal HPA axis activity [[20]]. This dual finding highlights the complex and often paradoxical nature of biological dysregulation in this population.\n\nLongitudinal studies offer a powerful application of the temporal framework, tracking how biological risk factors unfold over time. A one-year longitudinal study of Chinese college students provided a clear causal pathway: baseline negative life events were found to predict the onset of NSSI one year later, an effect that was fully mediated by subsequent increases in rumination and difficulties with emotional regulation [[11]]. This demonstrates that environmental stressors initiate a cascade of psychological processes, which then manifest as biological dysregulation and ultimately lead to the behavior. In a similar vein, a study of at-risk adolescents showed that elevated salivary cortisol levels measured months before psychosis onset were a significant predictor of conversion to a psychotic disorder, suggesting that HPA axis hyperactivity precedes and may contribute to the development of severe mental illness [[13]]. While not focused on NSSI, this finding underscores the power of longitudinal designs in identifying preclinical biological markers for serious psychiatric conditions. Together, these applications—from targeted pharmacology to predictive modeling and longitudinal tracking—demonstrate how a deeper understanding of the biology of NSSI is paving the way for more precise and effective interventions."

      "heading": "Challenges and Open Problems in the Field",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Despite significant progress, the field of biological research on nonsuicidal self-injury faces numerous challenges and open problems that temper enthusiasm and highlight the complexity of the subject. A primary issue is the pervasive heterogeneity across studies, which complicates efforts to draw firm conclusions and generalize findings. This heterogeneity manifests in several ways. First, there is a lack of consensus on definitions, with studies using different terms like NSSI and deliberate self-harm (DSH) and varying criteria for what constitutes an incident [[10]]. Second, assessment methods vary widely, from different questionnaires to inconsistent timing of biological sampling [[26]]. Third, and perhaps most critically, there is a high degree of comorbidity. Many studies of \"adolescents with NSSI\" are conducted in clinical samples already diagnosed with conditions like BPD, MDD, or anxiety disorders [[18]]. This makes it exceedingly difficult to disentangle biological markers that are specific to NSSI from those that are secondary to these co-occurring conditions. This confounding factor means that much of what is described as a \"biological correlate of NSSI\" may actually be a correlate of the underlying mood or personality disorder.\n\nMethodological limitations represent another significant hurdle. The vast majority of neuroimaging and biomarker studies are cross-sectional case-control designs, which can establish associations but cannot determine causality or directionality [[5,18]]. While longitudinal studies are increasing, they remain less common and often suffer from short follow-up periods and high attrition rates [[10,11]]. For instance, a meta-analysis of HPA axis studies noted that many employed small sample sizes, gender biases (often exclusively female samples), and variable assessment timing, all of which limit the robustness of the conclusions [[26]]. Furthermore, the translation of findings into clinically useful tools is fraught with difficulty. Machine learning models that show promising predictive accuracy in one study often fail in cross-subject validation, as seen in the 2025 study that achieved 85.9% accuracy when classifying states within subjects but only 73.7% accuracy when generalizing to new subjects [[21]]. This suggests that biological signatures may be highly idiosyncratic or influenced by unmeasured variables, making them unreliable for broad clinical application.\n\nFinally, there are significant gaps in our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms. The relationship between the HPA axis and NSSI remains particularly enigmatic, with conflicting findings on whether cortisol levels are elevated, blunted, or normal in individuals with NSSI [[26]]. Some studies report no difference between groups, while others find higher hair cortisol, a greater cortisol awakening response, or a blunted stress-induced response, leaving the nature of HPA axis dysregulation unresolved [[26]]. Similarly, while neurotransmitter systems like serotonin and glutamate are frequently implicated, the precise nature of their imbalance and how it translates into the complex behavior of NSSI is not well understood. There is a pressing need for more mechanistic studies that go beyond correlation to explore causal pathways. For example, while impulsivity is a known risk factor, driven by prefrontal cortex immaturity and neurochemical instability, more research is needed to understand how these factors translate into the decision to self-injure [[23]]. Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort towards larger, more methodologically rigorous, and longitudinal studies that explicitly account for comorbidity and adopt a systems-level approach to understanding the dynamic interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors."

      "heading": "Future Research Directions and Conclusion",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "To overcome the current challenges and deepen our understanding of the biological underpinnings of nonsuicidal self-injury, future research must pursue several strategic directions. The foremost priority is to embrace a systems-level, integrative approach that explicitly accounts for the heterogeneity and comorbidity inherent in the population. Instead of searching for a single \"NSSI biomarker,\" the goal should be to map the dynamic biological signatures of different NSSI phenotypes. This requires a shift from traditional group comparisons to network and machine learning analyses that can identify subgroups of individuals with shared biological profiles. For instance, the \"feedback loop reversal\" identified by the Graph Neural Network in one study offers a glimpse into how such an approach can uncover systemic dysregulation [[21]]. Future work should apply these complex systems methods more broadly to integrate multimodal data—including genomics, epigenetics, metabolomics, and real-time physiological recordings—to build more comprehensive models of risk.\n\nA second critical direction is the adoption of more sophisticated longitudinal and real-time methodologies. To truly understand the temporal dynamics of NSSI, we need studies that follow individuals from before the onset of the behavior through adolescence and into adulthood. This would allow us to distinguish between biological precursors and consequences. Combining these longitudinal designs with intensive ecological momentary assessment (EMA) will be vital. EMA can capture the immediate neuroendocrine, autonomic, and subjective states preceding an NSSI act, providing unparalleled insight into the acute biological processes that drive the behavior [[4,6]]. This approach can help resolve ambiguities, such as whether heightened arousal or a drop in arousal is the key trigger, and link these acute events to the chronic dysregulation observed in cross-sectional studies.\n\nFinally, future research must prioritize translational goals. This includes validating promising biological markers in independent cohorts and across different populations, including male and non-Western samples, to ensure generalizability [[5,22]]. The development of adjunctive treatments based on biological targets is another key objective. For example, given the evidence for glutamatergic and immune system involvement, clinical trials of agents like ketamine (a rapid-acting glutamate modulator) or anti-inflammatory drugs in NSSI populations are warranted. Moreover, research should continue to explore how biological dysregulation informs psychotherapeutic approaches. For example, if pre-treatment amygdala-prefrontal connectivity predicts clinical improvement with DBT, this could be used to personalize treatment matching [[3]].\n\nIn conclusion, the biological investigation of nonsuicidal self-injury has made substantial strides, moving from descriptive reports to sophisticated analyses of genetic, neuroendocrine, and neurochemical systems. The introduction of a temporal framework allows us to see this research not as a collection of isolated findings but as a dynamic process involving interactions across multiple biological systems over different timescales. While significant challenges remain, including high comorbidity and methodological inconsistencies, the field is poised for exciting breakthroughs. By adopting systems-level thinking, employing longitudinal and real-time methods, and maintaining a clear focus on translational outcomes, future research can transform our understanding of NSSI's biology and pave the way for more effective, personalized prevention and treatment strategies.\n\n---"
