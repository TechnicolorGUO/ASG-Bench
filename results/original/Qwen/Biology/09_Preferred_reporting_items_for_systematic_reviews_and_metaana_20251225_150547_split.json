      "content": "The proliferation of scientific literature has necessitated the development of rigorous methodologies for synthesizing evidence to inform research, policy, and practice. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses stand as cornerstones of evidence-based science, offering a structured approach to collate and evaluate findings from multiple studies. However, the credibility and utility of these syntheses are fundamentally dependent on the transparency and completeness of their reporting. Poorly reported reviews can lead to misinterpretation, flawed conclusions, and a waste of resources, thereby undermining the very foundation of scientific progress. This challenge is particularly acute in fields like ecology and evolutionary biology (EcoEvo), where research questions are often complex, data are heterogeneous, and the consequences of incorrect synthesis can be significant for conservation and management decisions [[4,8]]. In response to this need, the field of medical research developed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, a landmark initiative aimed at standardizing and improving the quality of reporting across systematic reviews [[1,6]].\n\nThe original PRISMA statement was published in 2009, replacing its predecessor, the QUOROM (Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses) guidelines, which had been established in 1996 [[5,11]]. The development of PRISMA involved an international group of 29 experts, including methodologists, clinicians, and editors, who convened in Ottawa, Canada, in June 2005 [[5,6]]. It consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram designed to improve the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses [[5,11]]. The statement's impact has been profound; it is cited in over 60,000 reports, endorsed by nearly 200 journals and organizations, and serves as the de facto standard for transparent reporting in health-related research [[2]]. An updated version, PRISMA 2020, was published in 2021 to further refine the guidelines based on contemporary challenges and advancements [[2,3,7]].\n\nWhile the principles underpinning PRISMA are broadly applicable, they were not originally tailored to the specific contexts, methodologies, and data types encountered in disciplines such as ecology and evolutionary biology. For instance, the \"PICOS\" framework (Participants, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes, Study design) that forms the basis of many review protocols is well-suited for clinical trials but less so for ecological studies investigating species interactions, environmental gradients, or long-term evolutionary trends [[1]]. This gap between a generalist guideline and the specialized needs of EcoEvo led to calls within the community for a more targeted solution. The motivation for developing a PRISMA extension for this field stems from empirical evidence of poor reporting practices. One study evaluating 102 papers in the discipline found that only ~16% cited any reporting guideline, and those that did showed significantly higher reporting quality [[4]]. This highlights both a lack of awareness and a clear opportunity for improvement.\n\nRecognizing this need, a team of researchers led by O’Dea et al. developed PRISMA-EcoEvo, a specialized extension to the PRISMA 2020 statement [[8,16]]. Published in *Biological Reviews*, this guideline aims to address the unique challenges faced by researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology [[8]]. Its primary objectives are to enhance the transparency, reproducibility, and trustworthiness of meta-analyses and systematic reviews in the field [[4]]. By providing explicit guidance on how to report ecological and evolutionary-specific information—such as taxonomic details, spatial scales, and environmental contexts—the extension seeks to ensure that the results of these syntheses are robust, interpretable, and useful for both academic inquiry and real-world applications. The development of PRISMA-EcoEvo represents a critical step towards integrating the rigors of systematic review methodology into the fabric of EcoEvo science, fostering a culture of open and accountable research synthesis."

      "level": 2,
      "content": "At the heart of the push for standardized reporting in systematic reviews lies a fundamental distinction between methodological guidance and reporting standards. The PRISMA statement, including its various extensions, is unequivocally a reporting guideline, not a prescriptive methodological protocol [[10]]. This is a critical concept for researchers to grasp. Its purpose is to provide a comprehensive checklist of items that should be included in the final manuscript describing a systematic review, ensuring that readers have all the necessary information to understand, assess, and potentially replicate the synthesis. It does not dictate how a review should be designed, conducted, or what statistical methods should be used. Instead, it complements other tools and frameworks that do provide methodological guidance. Organizations like the Cochrane Collaboration and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) offer detailed protocols and methodological checklists for conducting high-quality reviews, covering aspects like risk-of-bias assessment, data extraction, and statistical analysis [[10]]. PRISMA operates at the final stage, ensuring that the completed work reflects this rigorous methodology accurately and transparently.\n\nThe foundational principle of PRISMA is transparency. The entire structure of the 27-item checklist and the accompanying Explanation and Elaboration document is built around making the review process visible to the reader [[6,10]]. This transparency supports several key goals. First, it enhances credibility by demonstrating that the review was conducted systematically and without undue bias. Second, it promotes replicability, allowing other researchers to follow the same path from question to conclusion. Third, it facilitates efficient peer review, as reviewers can quickly locate and assess the key components of the methodology [[10]]. To achieve this, PRISMA emphasizes the importance of prospective registration of reviews, which creates a public record of the planned methods before the review is undertaken, thus discouraging post-hoc changes driven by results [[6]]. Furthermore, the guidelines encourage the reporting of amendments made during the review process, providing a complete history of the project [[2]].\n\nA central element of the PRISMA framework is the PICOS model, which provides a structured way to define the components of a review question [[1]]. While primarily developed for clinical interventions, its logic is adaptable. For an ecological review, the components might be interpreted as follows:\n*   **Population:** The species, taxa, or ecosystem being studied.\n*   **Intervention/Exposure:** The environmental factor, treatment, or human activity being investigated (e.g., climate change, pesticide application).\n*   **Comparator:** The control condition or alternative exposure against which effects are measured.\n*   **Outcomes:** The biological responses being measured (e.g., population size, growth rate, genetic diversity).\n*   **Study Design:** The type of observational or experimental study (e.g., longitudinal study, manipulative experiment).\n\nThis adaptability is crucial for its application beyond medicine. Indeed, the PRISMA 2020 statement explicitly acknowledges that while initially focused on randomized trials, its items are relevant to other research types, including observational studies, diagnostics, and policy analysis [[6,7]]. The evolution from QUOROM to PRISMA involved decoupling combined items and improving consistency, making the guidelines more flexible and easier to apply across different domains [[6,11]]. The EQUATOR Network, a leading authority on reporting guidelines, maintains a registry of PRISMA and its numerous extensions, underscoring the ecosystem of standards that support high-quality evidence synthesis across diverse fields [[10]]. These foundational concepts—distinguishing reporting from methodology, prioritizing transparency, adapting core models like PICOS, and leveraging a supportive ecosystem of related tools—form the intellectual bedrock upon which PRISMA-EcoEvo and other extensions are built."

      "heading": "Historical Development and Milestones",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The journey toward the PRISMA-EcoEvo extension is part of a broader historical trajectory of developing and refining reporting standards for evidence synthesis. The story begins with the QUOROM (Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses) statement, established in 1996 to address the widespread problem of poor reporting in meta-analyses, particularly in the medical field [[5,11]]. QUOROM provided a preliminary checklist of items deemed essential for transparent reporting. However, as the field of systematic review evolved, the limitations of QUOROM became apparent, prompting the development of a more comprehensive and widely accepted successor. This culminated in the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement, which was developed through a rigorous, international consensus process involving 29 key stakeholders, including methodologists, clinicians, and editors [[1,5,6]]. The three-day meeting in Ottawa, Canada, in June 2005, marked a pivotal moment, resulting in the creation of the 27-item checklist and the now-iconic four-phase PRISMA flow diagram [[5,11]]. The statement was formally published in 2009, co-published across several high-impact journals to maximize dissemination, and was supported by a detailed Explanation and Elaboration document that provided the rationale and examples for each checklist item [[1,5,11]]. The successful transition from QUOROM to PRISMA was swift, with endorsing journals adopting the new standard, solidifying its place as the benchmark for reporting in evidence synthesis [[6]].\n\nAs the use of systematic reviews expanded into new fields, it became clear that a one-size-fits-all approach was insufficient. This led to the development of a suite of PRISMA extensions, each tailored to a specific type of review or evidence synthesis. The first major extension, PRISMA-P (for Protocols), was published in 2015 to address the need for transparent reporting of the planned methods for a review before it was conducted [[10,13]]. This was followed by PRISMA-ScR (for Scoping Reviews) in 2018, which adapts the guidelines for reviews that map key concepts and sources in a broad topic area rather than answering a precise intervention question [[7,10]]. Another critical extension is PRISMA-S, which focuses specifically on the reporting of the literature search strategy itself, recognizing that the search is a cornerstone of the review process [[9,12]]. More recent updates include extensions for network meta-analyses (PRISMA-NMA), meta-analyses of individual participant data (PRISMA-IPD), diagnostic test accuracy studies (PRISMA-DTA), and a tool called SWiM for reporting reviews that do not involve statistical pooling of results (Synthesis Without Meta-analysis) [[3,7]]. These developments demonstrate a maturing ecosystem of reporting guidelines that cater to the increasing specialization within the field of evidence synthesis.\n\nThe development of PRISMA 2020 marked another significant milestone, updating the original 2009 guidelines to reflect contemporary research practices and persistent reporting deficiencies [[2,18]]. The update process was itself a collaborative and transparent endeavor, involving a literature review, a survey of 220 methodologists and editors, and a consensus meeting in Edinburgh in September 2018 [[2]]. Key changes in PRISMA 2020 included the mandatory reporting of full search strategies for all databases, a stronger emphasis on reporting reviewer independence and the use of automation tools, and the inclusion of new items for assessing the certainty of evidence and reporting data availability [[2]]. The publication of PRISMA 2020 in 2021 was accompanied by three companion papers: the statement paper, a development paper detailing the update process, and a comprehensive Explanation and Elaboration document to guide implementation [[7,13]]. This continuous cycle of development—from QUOROM to PRISMA, to a series of extensions, and now the 2020 update—highlights a dynamic and responsive effort by the global research community to maintain the highest standards of transparency and rigor in evidence synthesis. The PRISMA-EcoEvo extension fits squarely within this lineage, applying the lessons learned from these earlier efforts to the specific context of ecology and evolutionary biology."

      "heading": "Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The current state of the art in reporting for systematic reviews and meta-analyses is characterized by a sophisticated ecosystem of interlocking standards and a growing reliance on technology to facilitate adherence. At its core, the primary technique remains the meticulous completion of a reporting checklist, such as the 27-item PRISMA 2020 checklist, supplemented by its corresponding Explanation and Elaboration document [[2,13]]. This document is not merely a list of items but a critical resource that provides authors with the rationale behind each recommendation, practical advice, and illustrative examples drawn from real-world studies [[1,11]]. This combination of checklist and elaboration ensures that authors understand not just *what* to report, but also *why* it is important for transparency and validity. The PRISMA flow diagram, a visual representation of the study selection process from initial search results through to the final included studies, remains a powerful technique for communicating the scope and rigor of the literature search transparently [[5,11]].\n\nBuilding upon this foundation, a variety of technological tools have emerged to streamline the reporting process. Perhaps the most common of these are web applications and software designed to automate the generation of the PRISMA flow diagram. One such example is PrismaView, a Python-based application that assists researchers in creating accurate and visually appealing diagrams and can even perform basic bibliometric analyses of reference data [[19]]. Such tools reduce the manual labor involved in tracking records through the screening process and help ensure that the diagram accurately reflects the numbers reported in the text. Beyond flow diagrams, there is a recognized need for more advanced digital solutions. For instance, one study proposed using 'systematicity cases,' which employ rule-based AI to automatically assess compliance with reporting guidelines like PRISMA, signaling a move towards more formalized and scalable methods of quality assurance [[17]].\n\nA significant trend in the state of the art is the increasing sophistication of reporting requirements for specific methodological steps. The PRISMA-S extension, for example, elevates the reporting of the literature search from a simple description to a detailed, 16-item checklist [[9]]. This includes items for documenting database names, search platforms, limits and filters, search updates, and the dates of the searches [[9]]. This level of detail is crucial for ensuring the search is fully reproducible. Similarly, the PRISMA 2020 guidelines introduced new items concerning the assessment of certainty in the body of evidence, reflecting a growing recognition that simply summarizing effect sizes is insufficient without a judgment on the confidence that can be placed in them [[2]]. This is often done using frameworks like GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations), though PRISMA itself does not prescribe a specific tool [[14]].\n\nFurthermore, the state of the art increasingly recognizes the role of automation and artificial intelligence, albeit with caution. While automated screening of titles and abstracts is becoming more common to manage large volumes of literature, its use is generally advised for efficiency rather than for the critical task of bias assessment, which still requires expert human judgment [[14]]. The focus is shifting towards developing techniques that augment human capabilities. This includes the use of repositories like the Open Science Framework (OSF) and Zenodo to make not only manuscripts but also underlying data, metadata, and code openly accessible, thereby enhancing transparency and facilitating true reproducibility [[15,16]]. The ultimate goal of these advanced methods and techniques is to create a system where the process of evidence synthesis is not only rigorous but also fully documented, transparent, and easily verifiable by others in the scientific community."

      "heading": "Applications and Case Studies",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The principles of systematic review reporting, primarily guided by the PRISMA statement and its extensions, have been applied across a wide range of scientific disciplines, with notable success in medicine and genetics, providing valuable precedents for their potential application in ecology and evolutionary biology. In medical research, where PRISMA originated, its adoption has become standard practice, with nearly 200 journals requiring its use [[2]]. The impact is evident in the improved transparency and quality of published reviews. A critical application involves the evaluation of health interventions, where PRISMA ensures that all relevant studies are identified, appraised, and synthesized in a systematic manner. Extensions like PRISMA-NMA allow for the complex analysis of multiple competing treatments, while PRISMA-DTA provides a framework for assessing the accuracy of diagnostic tests, both of which are vital for clinical decision-making [[3,7]].\n\nIn the field of genetics, a pioneering adaptation of the PRISMA guidelines demonstrated the power of tailoring reporting standards to a specific domain. A study that adapted PRISMA for genetic association studies found that the modification significantly improved the quality of reporting and methodological rigor [[15]]. Before the adaptation, only 34% of reviewed studies were considered reproducible. After implementation, this figure rose to 67%. The adapted framework introduced new checklist items for reporting genetic-specific factors such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), and population stratification, issues that are irrelevant in clinical trials but paramount in genetic research [[15]]. Expert consultations revealed strong consensus among researchers for these additions, highlighting the importance of engaging the target scientific community in the development of such guidelines [[15]]. This case study serves as a powerful proof-of-concept for the PRISMA-EcoEvo initiative, showing that specialized extensions can directly address field-specific weaknesses and substantially improve the quality of research synthesis.\n\nWhile direct case studies of the PRISMA-EcoEvo extension are not available in the provided sources, the principles it advocates can be illustrated by examining the known problems in the current reporting of ecological meta-analyses. Research has shown that ecological reviews often suffer from significant shortcomings, including insufficient discussion of the magnitude of effect sizes, inadequate handling of heterogeneity, and failure to adequately assess publication bias [[16]]. There is also a noted tendency to inadequately adapt clinical methodologies for the unique characteristics of ecological data, such as exposure misclassification in observational studies [[14]]. The PRISMA-EcoEvo extension aims to rectify these issues by encouraging authors to provide full disclosure of their methods, data, and statistical code in public repositories like OSF and Zenodo [[16]]. This would allow for greater scrutiny and replication, moving the field away from opaque analyses and towards a more open and accountable mode of research synthesis. Although no specific case studies exist yet, the anticipated application of PRISMA-EcoEvo is to address these very gaps, thereby enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of meta-analytical findings in ecology and evolutionary biology [[4]]. The development of this extension itself is a landmark case study in the broader movement to apply the principles of evidence-based science to all areas of research.\n\n| Guideline/Extension | Primary Field/Application | Key Innovations and Focus | Source(s) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **PRISMA** | Health/Medicine | General reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses; 27-item checklist, flow diagram. | [[1,5,11]] |\n| **PRISMA-EcoEvo** | Ecology & Evolutionary Biology | Adaptation of PRISMA to address field-specific issues like taxonomy, spatial scale, and environmental context. | [[4,8,16]] |\n| **PRISMA-P** | Health/Medicine | Reporting of systematic review protocols to promote transparency and prevent selective reporting. | [[10,13]] |\n| **PRISMA-S** | All Disciplines | Detailed reporting of literature search strategies to ensure reproducibility. | [[9,12]] |\n| **Genetic PRISMA Adaptation** | Genetics | Reporting of genetic-specific factors (e.g., SNPs, HWE, population stratification) to improve reproducibility. | [[15]] |\n| **PRISMA-NMA/DTA/IPD** | Health/Medicine | Specialized reporting for network meta-analyses, diagnostic test accuracy, and individual participant data meta-analyses. | [[3,7]] |"

      "heading": "Challenges and Open Problems",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Despite the widespread endorsement and clear benefits of reporting guidelines like PRISMA, their implementation faces significant challenges and open problems that hinder their effectiveness across all scientific disciplines. One of the most pervasive issues is low adherence and suboptimal reporting quality. An empirical evaluation of 25 self-identified systematic reviews found that their average adherence to PRISMA guidelines was only 54.42%, indicating a substantial gap between the ideal and the reality of reporting practice [[17]]. This problem persists even with the updated PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A meta-epidemiological study of 222 non-Cochrane systematic reviews found that while 30.18% reported using PRISMA 2020, none achieved full adherence. The average adherence score across these studies was a mere 42.64%, with particularly low compliance in the Methods and Results sections [[18]]. This suggests that while awareness may be growing, translating that awareness into rigorous, line-by-line adherence remains a formidable challenge.\n\nAnother major challenge lies in the misuse and misunderstanding of the guidelines themselves. PRISMA is frequently misinterpreted as a methodological checklist or a quality assessment tool, when its sole purpose is reporting [[10,14]]. This confusion leads to inappropriate application, such as using it to judge the validity of a review rather than the transparency of its description. Journal editors and peer reviewers can inadvertently perpetuate this issue by requesting methodological checks rather than focusing on whether the reported information allows for an adequate assessment of the review's conduct. This conflation of roles dilutes the intended function of the guideline and can lead to unproductive criticism. Furthermore, the complexity of some reviews, especially those involving observational data in fields like environmental epidemiology, presents unique challenges. Rigid, algorithmic risk-of-bias assessments, often borrowed from clinical trials, may lack the scientific nuance required to properly evaluate confounding and exposure misclassification in ecological studies, potentially leading to inaccurate judgments about the quality of the evidence [[14]].\n\nThe development of specialized extensions like PRISMA-EcoEvo introduces its own set of challenges. The primary hurdle is ensuring that these extensions are adopted and used correctly by the target research community. Even if an extension is developed, it must be promoted, taught, and integrated into the workflows of researchers, journal editorial policies, and funding agency requirements. Without this uptake, it risks becoming a niche document with little practical impact. A related open problem is the lack of comprehensive guidelines for all types of evidence synthesis in the life sciences. For example, the PRISMA-EcoEvo article itself notes a continuing need for specialized reporting guidelines for phylogenetic comparative studies, indicating that the work of standardization is far from complete [[8]]. Finally, the very nature of scientific discovery means that reporting challenges are constantly evolving. New data types, analytical methods, and research questions will continue to emerge, demanding the ongoing development of new extensions and the periodic updating of existing ones. Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort from researchers, educators, journal editors, and guideline developers to foster a genuine culture of transparent and rigorous reporting."

      "heading": "Future Research Directions",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The future of reporting guidelines in systematic review and evidence synthesis is poised for continued evolution, driven by the dual imperatives of addressing persistent challenges and adapting to new frontiers in science. Several key research directions are emerging to enhance the utility, accessibility, and impact of these standards. A primary area for future work is the development and validation of PRISMA extensions for underrepresented but critically important research areas. The call for specialized guidelines for phylogenetic comparative studies within ecology is a prime example [[8]]. Other promising avenues include extensions for complex modeling approaches, citizen science projects, and interdisciplinary research that integrates quantitative and qualitative data. Research is needed not only to draft these guidelines but also to develop and test educational materials to ensure their effective adoption by researchers in these fields. The success of the genetic PRISMA adaptation, which was informed by extensive expert consultation, serves as a blueprint for this participatory approach to guideline development [[15]].\n\nAnother significant future direction is the deeper integration of technology and artificial intelligence into the reporting ecosystem. While current tools like PrismaView assist with flow diagram generation, the next wave of innovation could involve AI-driven systems that go beyond simple templates. Research could focus on developing natural language processing (NLP) tools that can scan a manuscript and flag potential reporting deficiencies against the PRISMA checklist, acting as a pre-submission quality-control measure for authors and editors [[17]]. Furthermore, as the push for open science grows, future research should explore the technical and ethical dimensions of linking reporting guidelines more directly to data repositories. This could involve creating machine-readable formats for reporting checklists (e.g., JSON-LD or RDF) that can be embedded in datasets deposited on platforms like OSF, Zenodo, or Dryad. This would create a seamless, interconnected web of evidence where the narrative of the review is directly linked to the data and code that support it, enabling automated verification and reuse.\n\nFinally, a crucial area for future investigation is the behavioral and cultural aspect of guideline adoption. Much of the current effort focuses on the content of the guidelines themselves. However, understanding why researchers and editors adopt or resist these standards is equally important. Future research should employ social science methodologies to study the barriers and facilitators of PRISMA adoption in different disciplines, including ecology and evolutionary biology. This could involve surveys, interviews, and experiments to test the effectiveness of different implementation strategies, such as mandating guidelines versus promoting them through education and incentives. Research could also explore how to better integrate reporting requirements into institutional review boards, grant proposal submissions, and tenure and promotion criteria, embedding the expectation of transparent reporting into the fabric of academic culture. Ultimately, the goal is to shift the paradigm from viewing reporting guidelines as an administrative burden to seeing them as an essential component of credible, impactful, and trustworthy science."

      "level": 2,
      "content": "In summary, the development and dissemination of the PRISMA-EcoEvo extension marks a significant milestone in the advancement of evidence synthesis in ecology and evolutionary biology. This initiative addresses a demonstrable gap in the transparent reporting of meta-analyses and systematic reviews within the field, building upon the proven success and foundational principles of the broader PRISMA family of guidelines [[4,8]]. The journey from the initial QUOROM statement to the highly specialized and continuously updated PRISMA 2020 framework illustrates a global commitment to improving the quality and credibility of evidence-based science [[2,5]]. The existence of a vibrant ecosystem of PRISMA extensions for diverse fields like genetics, environmental health, and scoping reviews provides a robust precedent and a clear pathway for the successful implementation of PRISMA-EcoEvo [[10,14,15]].\n\nHowever, the path forward is not without challenges. The pervasive issue of low adherence to reporting guidelines, even in well-established fields like medicine, serves as a sobering reminder that the mere existence of a standard is insufficient for ensuring its application [[17,18]]. The successful adoption of PRISMA-EcoEvo will require concerted efforts from the entire scientific community—including researchers, journal editors, funding agencies, and educators—to champion its use and integrate it into the research workflow. Future research must focus on validating the extension's impact on the quality of ecological meta-analyses, developing user-friendly technological aids to facilitate its application, and studying the cultural shifts needed to embed transparent reporting as a core tenet of scientific practice. By doing so, the field of ecology and evolutionary biology can harness the power of systematic review methodology to produce more reliable, reproducible, and trustworthy syntheses, ultimately strengthening its contribution to our understanding of the natural world and informing more effective conservation and management policies.\n\n---"
