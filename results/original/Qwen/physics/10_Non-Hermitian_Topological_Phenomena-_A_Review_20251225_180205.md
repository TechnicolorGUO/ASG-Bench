## Introduction and Research Motivation

The confluence of non-Hermitian physics and topological matter represents one of the most dynamic and rapidly evolving frontiers in modern condensed matter physics, photonics, and mechanics. Traditionally, Hermiticity of a system's Hamiltonian is considered a fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics, ensuring real energy spectra and unitary time evolution. However, recent theoretical and experimental advances have demonstrated that many physical systems are inherently described by non-Hermitian operators, which account for crucial open-system effects such as gain, loss, dissipation, and coupling to external environments. Simultaneously, the study of topology has revealed that certain properties of matter are robust against continuous deformations, leading to protected boundary states that are impervious to disorder. The marriage of these two fields has given rise to a rich and counter-intuitive landscape of phenomena that defy conventional wisdom, challenging long-held principles like the bulk-boundary correspondence and fundamentally reshaping our understanding of phase transitions and wave propagation in solids.

The primary motivation for this review stems from the profound implications of these discoveries for both fundamental science and technological innovation. For decades, physicists have relied on the framework of Hermitian quantum mechanics to describe isolated systems. Yet, in the laboratory, nearly all systems interact with their surroundings to some degree. Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians provide a powerful effective description of these interactions, allowing researchers to explore how the delicate balance between gain and loss can sculpt the very fabric of a material's electronic or photonic structure. This exploration has unveiled new forms of matter and novel functionalities that are inaccessible within the confines of Hermitian theory. The resulting field not only deepens our theoretical understanding but also promises transformative applications, from robust optical devices immune to defects and backscattering to highly sensitive sensors and low-power information carriers. By systematically reviewing the current state of knowledge, this paper aims to synthesize the key concepts, highlight pivotal breakthroughs, analyze the challenges that remain, and chart the future course for this exciting interdisciplinary domain.

This review is structured to provide a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of non-Hermitian topological phenomena. It begins with an introduction to the foundational principles, defining key concepts and historical milestones that set the stage for the revolution. Following this, we delve into the current state-of-the-art, examining the advanced theoretical frameworks and experimental platforms that have enabled the exploration of this new territory. We then survey the burgeoning field of applications, detailing how these exotic phenomena are being harnessed for practical purposes. A critical analysis of the field's strengths and weaknesses follows, identifying the major research gaps and outlining promising future directions. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the key findings and assessing the overall impact and trajectory of this rapidly advancing field. Through this systematic literature review, we aim to provide a definitive resource for researchers and students seeking to understand the principles, progress, and potential of non-Hermitian topological systems.

## Foundational Concepts and Key Milestones

The emergence of non-Hermitian topological physics was not a singular event but rather the culmination of parallel developments in several distinct areas of physics. Its foundation rests on two pillars: the discovery of novel topological phases in Hermitian systems and the realization that many physical systems are more accurately described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The first milestone occurred with the identification of topological insulators—materials that are insulating in their bulk but conduct electricity along their edges due to a topologically protected gapless state [[1]]. These states are governed by a principle known as the bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC), which posits a direct relationship between a system's topological invariant calculated from its bulk band structure and the number of robust edge modes [[1,18]]. The second, more revolutionary milestone was the recognition that introducing non-Hermiticity—manifesting as asymmetric coupling, gain, or loss—into these systems could fundamentally alter their spectral and transport properties, often violating the conventional BBC and giving rise to entirely new classes of phenomena [[10,22]].

A critical concept underpinning much of the early work was PT-symmetry, where a system remains invariant under simultaneous parity (P) reflection and time-reversal (T) operations [[20]]. In 1998, Bender and Boettcher made a groundbreaking discovery that even certain non-Hermitian Hamiltonians could possess entirely real and positive energy spectra if they respected PT-symmetry, thus challenging the necessity of Hermiticity for a physically viable quantum theory [[17,20]]. While initially met with skepticism, this idea provided a mathematical framework for exploring non-Hermitian systems with well-behaved energy spectra. However, it became clear that PT-symmetry was not the only path to interesting physics. Researchers began to focus on the more general phenomenon of exceptional points (EPs)—degeneracies in the parameter space of a non-Hermitian system where both eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce [[10,21]]. Unlike simple level crossings in Hermitian systems, EPs are branch-point singularities on Riemann surfaces, endowed with unique topological properties [[21]]. Encircling an EP adiabatically results in an eigenstate swapping, and for second-order EPs, this process acquires a quantized π Berry phase, serving as a topological marker for the underlying system [[8,21]].

The true revolution began when these abstract concepts were linked to lattice models, which serve as idealized representations of crystalline materials. The Hatano-Nelson (HN) model, introduced in the 1990s to describe the localization of flux lines in superconductors in the presence of an imaginary vector potential, provided one of the earliest examples of non-Hermiticity arising from asymmetric hopping amplitudes [[9]]. This model naturally exhibited what would later be identified as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where all bulk states localize at the boundaries of the system [[1,9]]. Another seminal model is the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, which incorporates alternating gain and loss into the paradigmatic two-band topological chain [[1,9]]. This model showcases how non-Hermiticity can induce topological phase transitions and lead to chiral symmetry-protected edge states [[9]]. These foundational models established the core themes of the field: the breakdown of conventional Bloch theory, the emergence of unconventional topological phases, and the central role of complex energy spectra.

The period between 2015 and 2020 marked a rapid acceleration in the field, driven by the development of sophisticated theoretical tools and the first wave of compelling experimental demonstrations. A key theoretical advance was the formulation of non-Bloch band theory by Yao and Wang, and independently by Yokomizo and Murakami, in 2018 [[1,2,22]]. This theory replaced the standard Brillouin zone with a generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ), a complex-space contour that correctly predicts the asymptotic behavior of eigenstates under open boundary conditions (OBC) and restores a modified form of the bulk-boundary correspondence [[1,18]]. This was a monumental step forward, providing a quantitative explanation for the NHSE and enabling accurate predictions of system properties. Concurrently, experimental platforms matured significantly. Optical systems, particularly coupled waveguide arrays and microring lasers, proved exceptionally versatile for engineering gain, loss, and non-reciprocity [[9,20]]. Landmark experiments realized the HN model in microring laser arrays [[9]], observed the NHSE in topolectrical circuits built from resistors and capacitors [[22]], and demonstrated the existence of knotted exceptional lines in photonic crystals [[4,18]]. These successes across diverse platforms—from cold atoms and acoustic metamaterials to mechanical lattices—consolidated the field and cemented its status as a mainstream area of physics research.

## Advanced Theoretical Frameworks and State-of-the-Art Methods

The theoretical landscape of non-Hermitian topological physics has evolved far beyond its initial conceptual foundations, developing a suite of sophisticated methods to navigate its unique challenges. The single most significant theoretical achievement has been the resolution of the broken bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) through the advent of non-Bloch band theory [[18,22]]. The conventional BBC, which links the bulk polarization to the number of edge states, fails spectacularly in non-Hermitian systems due to the NHSE, where eigenstates are exponentially localized at the boundaries, rendering the standard Bloch plane-wave ansatz invalid [[1,10]]. To overcome this, researchers developed the concept of the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ), a closed curve or set of curves in the complex momentum plane that dictates the exponential decay rates of eigenstates under open boundary conditions (OBC) [[1,18]]. By calculating topological invariants using the GBZ instead of the standard Brillouin zone, a modified BBC can be restored, correctly predicting the number of OBC eigenstates [[1,22]]. This framework has become a cornerstone of the field, enabling accurate predictions of topological phase diagrams and guiding experimental design.

Building on this foundation, a richer tapestry of topological characterization has emerged, tailored specifically for the complex-energy plane. One of the most powerful tools is spectral winding topology, which characterizes the topological nature of a system based on how its energy spectrum winds around a particular point in the complex plane as system parameters are varied [[18,23]]. This approach provides a unified classification scheme that applies to both point-gap and line-gap topologies and can be used to define topological invariants without reference to specific symmetries [[8]]. Another crucial advancement is the development of biorthogonal polarization and nested-Wilson-loop analyses [[5,13]]. In non-Hermitian systems, the right and left eigenstates form a biorthonormal basis, and physical observables must be calculated using the biorthogonal inner product. This leads to the definition of a biorthogonal polarization, which serves as a valid topological invariant and correctly predicts the presence of boundary modes [[5,26]]. For higher-order topological phases, which host corner or hinge states, a biorthogonal nested-Wilson-loop analysis is required to calculate the quantized quadrupole or octupole moment, providing a robust signature of the bulk topology [[13,14]].

Further theoretical progress has come from mapping non-Hermitian dynamics onto different physical scenarios. Kohei Kawabata et al. developed a topological field theory formulated purely in spatial degrees of freedom, which explains intrinsic non-Hermitian phenomena like the chiral magnetic skin effect in 3D and unidirectional transport in 1D as consequences of anomalies [[2]]. This approach offers a deeper conceptual understanding of the NHSE. Another innovative method involves mapping the dynamics of a wave onto a static mechanical lattice by treating time as a spatial dimension, effectively emulating non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in passive, energy-conserving systems [[7]]. This technique allows for the observation of the NHSE and higher-order skin effects in setups that do not require active gain or loss, opening up new avenues for tabletop experiments. The interplay between non-Hermitian physics and machine learning is also emerging as a powerful tool; Shang C. et al. demonstrated that neural networks can be trained to identify second-order non-Hermitian skin effects in complex datasets, showcasing a hybrid approach to discovering and classifying topological phases [[17]].

Despite these advances, the field is not without its theoretical inconsistencies and open problems. Different classification schemes sometimes yield conflicting results, particularly when comparing classifications based on energy spectra versus those based on eigenstates [[18]]. Furthermore, the extension of these elegant theories to interacting many-body systems remains a formidable challenge, representing a frontier for future research [[23]]. The development of analytical techniques for solving non-Hermitian models, especially in higher dimensions, is an ongoing effort. While exact solutions exist for simple one-dimensional chains like the HN and SSH models [[9]], finding analytical expressions for more complex systems, such as higher-order topological insulators with engineered gain/loss profiles, remains difficult. Consequently, numerical simulations and perturbative approaches are often necessary to explore the parameter space of these systems. Nonetheless, the cumulative development of these advanced frameworks—from the GBZ and spectral winding to biorthogonal methods and field-theoretic descriptions—has provided the essential toolkit for navigating the complex and counter-intuitive world of non-Hermitian topology.

## Experimental Platforms and Physical Manifestations

The remarkable theoretical progress in non-Hermitian topological physics has been matched by a surge in experimental realizations across a wide array of physical platforms. These experiments have been instrumental in validating theoretical predictions and revealing new phenomena, demonstrating the universality of non-Hermitian principles. Photonic systems, particularly those based on integrated optics, have proven to be an exceptionally versatile and accessible platform. Coupled waveguide arrays allow for precise control over coupling strengths, while microring resonator arrays enable the implementation of on-site gain and loss [[9,20]]. These systems have been used to realize foundational models like the Hatano-Nelson chain [[9]], observe the non-Hermitian skin effect [[22]], demonstrate the existence of exceptional rings stemming from Dirac cones [[21]], and showcase the amplification of topological edge states for non-reciprocal transport [[20]]. Other prominent photonic platforms include polariton micropillar lasers [[9]], modulated photonic waveguide arrays for tunable nodal point degeneracies [[19]], and topolectrical circuits, which use passive electronic components to emulate the Hamiltonians of topological materials [[22]].

Beyond photonics, the field has seen successful implementations in acoustics and mechanics, highlighting the broad applicability of the underlying principles. Acoustic metamaterials, consisting of arrays of coupled cavities or resonators, offer a direct way to engineer asymmetric couplings and gain/loss profiles [[5]]. Experiments in this domain have successfully demonstrated the non-Hermitian skin effect [[7]], the existence of topological monomodes (unpaired edge states) [[11]], and the induction of higher-order topological phases via engineered losses [[13]]. Mechanical metamaterials provide another fertile ground for exploration. Static mechanical lattices can be designed to exhibit non-Hermitian behavior through geometric asymmetries or Willis coupling, which relates stress to velocity and vice versa, without requiring any active elements [[17,26]]. Recent work has shown that such systems can realize extended topological modes and dynamic non-Hermitian skin effects [[16,27]]. Furthermore, a novel approach maps wave dynamics into a "static" system by treating time as a spatial coordinate, allowing for the passive observation of the non-Hermitian skin effect in truss-like lattices [[7]].

The table below summarizes some of the key experimental platforms and the phenomena they have successfully demonstrated.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Photonic Lattices** | Hatano-Nelson Chain, NHSE, PT-Symmetry, Topological Lasers | Coupled waveguides, microring arrays, topolectrical circuits | Engineered gain/loss, tunable coupling, non-reciprocity | [[9,20,22]] |

One of the most striking manifestations of non-Hermitian physics is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where all extended bulk states of a system collapse and localize at the boundaries under open boundary conditions [[1,10]]. This phenomenon is a direct consequence of asymmetric hopping or coupling and fundamentally alters the system's response. It has been observed in topolectrical circuits, where voltage distributions show dramatic boundary trapping [[22]], in acoustic systems with engineered losses [[7]], and in dynamic mechanical systems where nonreciprocity perpendicular to the wave propagation direction is enforced by glide-time symmetry [[27]]. Another fascinating outcome is the emergence of extended topological modes (ETMs). In a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with non-reciprocal coupling, a topological mode can become fully delocalized across the entire system at a specific parameter value, a stark departure from the localized edge states of Hermitian counterparts [[16]]. This demonstrates the profound control non-Hermiticity affords over the spatial extent of quantum states. In magnonics, non-Hermitian effects manifest as the selective amplification of chiral edge modes, where one direction of propagation is enhanced while the opposite is damped, offering a route to robust, directional spin-wave transport [[24,25]]. These diverse experimental achievements underscore the power and generality of non-Hermitian principles, paving the way for a new generation of functional devices.

## Applications and Case Studies

The unique properties of non-Hermitian topological systems have catalyzed a new wave of device-level applications, moving the field from pure fundamental science to the realm of applied technology. The most prominent and actively pursued application is in topological photonics, where non-Hermitian systems are used to create robust optical devices that are immune to defects and backscattering. The hallmark of this application is the creation of topological lasers. By placing a gain medium within a non-Hermitian topological insulator, light can be confined and amplified along the system's protected edge states, leading to ultra-low-threshold lasing with high beam quality [[9,20]]. Early demonstrations included topological insulator lasers using micropillar lasers [[9]] and more recent work has shown lasing from corner states in non-Hermitian quadrupole systems [[9]]. These devices benefit from the dual protection of topology and non-Hermiticity, ensuring stable operation even in the presence of imperfections. Other applications in this vein include reconfigurable frequency combs, nonlinear optical switches, and electromagnetic modulators with record-high contrast achieved using PIN diodes [[9,19]].

Another major area of application is sensing. The extreme sensitivity of exceptional points to external perturbations makes them ideal candidates for creating ultrasensitive detectors. When a small object or change in the environment is brought near a system operating at an EP, it breaks the coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, causing a significant shift in the system's response, such as its resonance frequency or transmission spectrum. This effect has been proposed and demonstrated for applications ranging from mass sensing to refractive index sensing [[10]]. For example, tunable perfect optical absorption in photonic crystals with lossy defects can be modulated by changing the defect layer thickness, enabling applications in optical switching and sensing [[19]]. Similarly, the amplification of one direction of spin waves over another in non-Hermitian magnon systems can be exploited for creating highly sensitive spin-wave detectors [[25]].

In the acoustic domain, non-Hermitian principles are being leveraged to achieve unprecedented control over sound waves. One of the most exciting prospects is robust topological rainbow trapping, where different frequencies of sound are localized at different positions along a graded, non-Hermitian acoustic crystal, creating a "rainbow" of trapped frequencies [[19]]. This concept has been demonstrated experimentally using gradient valley photonic crystals adapted for acoustics, showing immunity to defects [[19]]. Furthermore, the ability to induce higher-order topological phases via engineered losses in acoustic crystals opens the door to designing acoustic devices with protected corner modes that can guide and trap sound in novel ways [[13]]. Beyond photonics and acoustics, the field holds promise for scalable topological magnonics. By using spin-transfer torque to introduce non-Hermiticity, researchers have demonstrated the selective amplification of chiral edge magnons, suggesting a path toward robust, low-dissipation spin-wave logic circuits [[24,25]]. The development of static mechanical metamaterials that emulate non-Hermitian Hamiltonians also points toward the future creation of passive acoustic and mechanical devices with built-in topological protection [[17,26]].

Case studies further illuminate the practical potential of these systems. A detailed study on a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with long-range hopping and a periodic gain-loss pattern showed that the system undergoes multiple topological phase transitions, characterized by changes in winding numbers and a hidden Chern number [[15]]. This work highlights how carefully designed non-Hermiticity can be used to tune a system through distinct topological phases, a capability that could be exploited for creating multi-state memory or logic devices. Another case study focused on a two-dimensional tight-binding model that exhibits higher-order topology without requiring negative couplings or artificial fluxes [[14]]. By introducing on-site loss on a subset of sites, the system transitions into a non-Hermitian higher-order topological insulator hosting zero-energy corner states [[14]]. The demonstration of this effect in a mechanical metamaterial confirmed excellent agreement between theory and experiment, showcasing a pathway to realizing robust, defect-immune mechanical structures. These examples collectively demonstrate that non-Hermitian topological phenomena are not merely academic curiosities but are becoming a tangible resource for building next-generation technologies with enhanced performance, robustness, and functionality.

## Critical Analysis, Challenges, and Future Directions

While the field of non-Hermitian topological physics has achieved remarkable success and generated immense excitement, a critical analysis reveals significant challenges and open questions that define its current limitations and future trajectory. One of the most persistent challenges lies in the robustness of topological states under disorder and strong non-Hermiticity [[1,18]]. The very mechanisms that give rise to novel phenomena, such as the NHSE, can also make systems susceptible to Anderson localization, where disorder causes all states to become localized, potentially destroying the distinction between trivial and topological phases. Understanding the interplay between non-Hermitian skin accumulation and disorder-induced localization is a major outstanding problem [[1]]. Similarly, extending the elegant theoretical frameworks developed for non-interacting systems to the realm of interacting many-body systems remains a formidable frontier [[23]]. Interactions can lead to new phases of matter and modify existing ones, and their interplay with non-Hermitian effects is largely unexplored territory.

A second major weakness of the field is the lack of a universally accepted and consistent classification scheme for all types of non-Hermitian topological phases. While significant progress has been made in classifying systems based on point-gap or line-gap topology, and various topological invariants have been proposed, inconsistencies can arise when comparing classifications derived from different approaches [[18]]. For instance, a system might be classified as topologically trivial based on its energy spectrum but non-trivial based on its eigenstate structure. Resolving these discrepancies and developing a comprehensive, all-encompassing classification that works across different dimensions, symmetries, and physical platforms is a crucial task for future theoretical work [[17]]. Additionally, the scalability and reproducibility of experimental devices remain a practical hurdle [[17]]. Fabricating large-scale, precisely controlled non-Hermitian lattices with uniform gain/loss profiles and minimal parasitic effects is technically demanding, and ensuring the stability of devices operating near exceptional points requires careful engineering to avoid instabilities [[24]].

Looking ahead, several promising future research directions are poised to shape the next decade of the field. A primary thrust will be the investigation of non-Hermitian physics in higher dimensions and in Floquet systems, which are periodically driven in time. These extensions are expected to uncover novel topological phases and dynamical phenomena, such as the dynamic non-Hermitian skin effect observed in mechanical systems [[27]]. The synergy between non-Hermiticity and interactions will be a central theme, with researchers aiming to understand how non-Hermitian baths can be used to engineer desired many-body entangled states or drive systems into new non-equilibrium steady states. The development of new theoretical tools, including advanced numerical simulations and machine learning-assisted discovery, will continue to accelerate progress in both classification and the prediction of new phases [[17]]. On the experimental front, the integration of non-Hermitian topological concepts into quantum technologies, such as for creating robust qubits or enhancing quantum metrology, represents a major goal. Furthermore, exploring the connection between non-Hermitian physics and other areas of physics, such as fluid dynamics, biology, and neuroscience, could reveal universal principles governing open, dissipative systems. Ultimately, the field stands at the precipice of a new era, where the intricate dance between gain, loss, and topology will continue to inspire fundamental breakthroughs and drive the invention of transformative technologies.
