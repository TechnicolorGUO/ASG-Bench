      "content": "The Hubbard model stands as a cornerstone in condensed matter physics, providing a fundamental theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of interacting electrons in solids. First introduced in 1963 by Martin Gutzwiller, Junjiro Kanamori, and John Hubbard, it was conceived to describe electronic correlations within narrow energy bands, such as those found in transition metals [[1,9]]. The model's Hamiltonian extends the simple tight-binding approximation by incorporating an on-site Coulomb repulsion term, denoted as `U`, which captures the energy cost for two electrons with opposite spins to occupy the same lattice site [[1,5]]. This seemingly simple addition gives rise to a rich and complex phase diagram, making the model a paradigm for strongly correlated electron systems [[2]]. Its enduring relevance stems from its ability to capture the essential physics behind some of the most profound phenomena in modern materials science, including Mott metal-insulator transitions, high-temperature superconductivity, and unconventional antiferromagnetism [[1,7]].\n\nFrom a computational perspective, the Hubbard model presents one of the most significant challenges in theoretical physics. While conceptually straightforward, finding exact solutions is notoriously difficult, and even approximate methods face formidable obstacles. This computational complexity has driven the development of a vast array of numerical techniques over the past six decades, serving as a crucible for advancing our capacity to solve many-body problems. The model's study has been intrinsically linked to the history of computing, from early analytical approximations and numerical diagonalization on mainframes to the modern era of tensor network algorithms running on supercomputers and quantum simulators. The primary motivation for this review is to provide a comprehensive and critical analysis of this computational landscape, charting the evolution of methodologies, assessing their current capabilities and limitations, and identifying the key open questions that continue to shape the field.\n\nThe historical trajectory of the Hubbard model is marked by several distinct eras of intense research, each triggered by major developments in either experimental physics or computational technology. The initial surge of interest began with Hubbard's seminal series of papers, culminating in his 1964 paper where he demonstrated the existence of a Mott-Hubbard transition—a correlation-driven insulating state—at half-filling, even for finite values of `U` [[1,11]]. However, the model's significance remained largely academic until the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates in 1986 [[1]]. This experimental breakthrough catapulted the two-dimensional Hubbard model into the forefront of condensed matter theory, as it became the natural starting point for exploring the microscopic origins of d-wave superconductivity. This led to the derivation of the *t*–*J* model as an effective low-energy description, though a rigorous proof connecting the two remains elusive [[1]].\n\nA second major resurgence occurred in the 2000s with the advent of quantum simulation using ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices [[1]]. Experiments successfully realized the bosonic version of the model, observing the transition from a superfluid to a Mott insulator, and later achieved the fermionic implementation, directly mapping out the phase diagram of the model in a clean, tunable environment [[1]]. These experiments provided unprecedented control over parameters like interaction strength and doping, offering a direct comparison to theoretical predictions and revealing new facets of the model's behavior. More recently, the model has found renewed importance in the context of moiré materials, such as twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which can be described by a triangular-lattice Hubbard model with extremely strong correlations [[9]]. This convergence of diverse physical platforms—from high-Tc cuprates to engineered quantum materials—underscores the model's central role and highlights the pressing need for ever-more sophisticated computational tools to unravel its mysteries. The objective of this review is therefore twofold: to serve as a comprehensive reference for the computational methods developed for the Hubbard model and to critically assess how these methods are being applied to address the most compelling open questions in the physics of strongly correlated systems."

      "content": "The Hubbard model, at its core, is a simplified yet powerful Hamiltonian designed to capture the interplay between kinetic energy and on-site Coulomb repulsion in a system of interacting electrons. Its mathematical formulation provides the basis for all subsequent computational investigations. The general form of the single-band Hubbard Hamiltonian on a lattice is given by:\n\n$ H = -t \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle, \\sigma} (c_{i,\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{j,\\sigma} + \\text{h.c.}) + U \\sum_i n_{i,\\uparrow} n_{i,\\downarrow} - \\mu \\sum_{i,\\sigma} n_{i,\\sigma} $\n\nHere, the operators $ c_{i,\\sigma}^\\dagger $ and $ c_{i,\\sigma} $ create and annihilate, respectively, an electron with spin $ \\sigma $ ($\\uparrow$ or $\\downarrow$) on lattice site $i$. The first term represents the kinetic energy, describing the hopping of electrons between nearest-neighbor sites $ \\langle i,j \\rangle $ with a hopping amplitude $t$. The second term is the on-site Coulomb repulsion, where $U$ is the energy penalty for double occupancy of a site, and $n_{i,\\sigma} = c_{i,\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{i,\\sigma}$ is the number operator. The last term, with chemical potential $\\mu$, controls the average electron density. The dimensionality of the lattice (e.g., one-, two-, or three-dimensional) and its geometry (e.g., square, triangular, honeycomb) are also critical parameters that define different incarnations of the model.\n\nThe defining feature of the model is the competition between the kinetic energy, which favors delocalization and metallic conduction, and the repulsive potential energy, which favors localization of electrons to minimize interactions. The ratio $U/t$ serves as the primary control parameter. At weak coupling ($U \\ll t$), kinetic energy dominates, and the system behaves as a Fermi liquid metal. As $U/t$ increases, correlations become more important. For sufficiently large $U$, the system undergoes a Mott metal-insulator transition, becoming an insulator due to strong electronic correlations rather than a band-theoretic gap [[1,11]]. This transition is a hallmark of strongly correlated physics and is not captured by mean-field theories.\n\nSeveral key concepts emerge from the Hubbard model that are central to its study. **Spin-charge separation** is perhaps the most striking phenomenon, observed analytically in the one-dimensional case. In this scenario, the elementary excitations at half-filling are no longer simple electrons but split into independent charge-carrying and spin-carrying quasiparticles: spinons (carrying spin but no charge) and holons/antiholons (carrying charge but no spin) [[11]]. This decoupling of charge and spin dynamics is a purely quantum effect without a classical analogue and has been experimentally observed in quasi-one-dimensional materials [[11]]. The full symmetry of the low-energy excitations in 1D is described by an SO(4) group, reflecting the deep underlying structure of the model [[11]].\n\nAnother crucial concept is the emergence of magnetic order. Even with a spin-independent Hamiltonian, strong repulsive interactions can lead to long-range antiferromagnetic order at half-filling. This can be understood through a perturbative expansion in the hopping term $t$. At leading order, virtual hopping processes induce an effective exchange interaction between neighboring spins, resulting in an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with coupling $J \\approx 4t^2/U$ [[6]]. This mechanism demonstrates how quantum fluctuations can give rise to collective magnetic ordering. Conversely, at finite doping away from half-filling, ferromagnetism can be stabilized under certain conditions, another non-trivial consequence of electron correlations [[6]].\n\nFinally, the concept of **local versus non-local correlations** is critical for understanding the model's complexity. Recent work has shown that while local electron correlations in Hubbard-type models can be fully characterized as \"classical\" when measured via mutual information between local natural spin orbitals, the true complexity arises from non-local entanglement processes that connect these local degrees of freedom [[12]]. This insight reframes the challenge of solving the model: it is not merely about capturing local physics correctly, but about accurately describing the intricate web of non-local quantum and classical correlations that gives rise to emergent phenomena like superconductivity and topological order. This distinction is vital for guiding the development of new computational ansatzes that can efficiently represent the global wavefunction of the system."

      "content": "The history of computational approaches to the Hubbard model is a microcosm of the broader evolution of numerical physics. It begins with analytical attempts to find exact solutions and progresses through a series of methodological revolutions spurred by advances in computing hardware and algorithmic innovation. The earliest efforts focused on solvable limits and approximate schemes. One of the first significant milestones was the development of the **Hubbard I and Hubbard III approximations**, which used equations of motion for Green's functions [[9]]. Hubbard I was a simple mean-field-like approach that incorrectly predicted a transition for any finite `U`, while Hubbard III improved upon this by including higher-order terms, correctly describing the Mott transition at finite temperature [[9]]. Though limited, these early methods laid the groundwork for systematic expansions.\n\nThe most profound breakthrough came with the exact solution of the one-dimensional (1D) Hubbard model by Elliott Lieb and F.Y. Wu in 1968 using the **Bethe ansatz** [[9,11]]. This was a landmark achievement, providing a complete set of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and proving the existence of a Mott transition for any positive `U` at half-filling [[11]]. The Bethe ansatz revealed the model's hidden integrability and the existence of four distinct types of quasiparticles, confirming the phenomenon of spin-charge separation [[11]]. This solution established the 1D model as a critical testbed for validating new theoretical and computational ideas for decades to come. To handle the thermodynamics of this exact solution, Takahashi developed the **thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA)**, which reformulated the quantization rules into non-linear integral equations suitable for studying finite temperatures and magnetic fields [[9,11]].\n\nThe next major leap forward occurred in the late 20th century with the introduction of powerful numerical techniques. The **Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG)**, invented by Steve White in 1992, revolutionized the study of 1D systems [[4]]. DMRG is an iterative numerical renormalization group method that efficiently truncates the Hilbert space of a quantum chain, allowing for highly accurate calculations of ground-state properties, correlation functions, and excitation spectra. Its success in the Hubbard model was immediate and dramatic, providing results that were far superior to previous methods for systems with hundreds of sites [[4]]. The widespread adoption of DMRG was facilitated by the development of efficient implementations and its extension to treat dynamical properties.\n\nParallel to DMRG, **Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)** methods became a dominant force for studying the Hubbard model in higher dimensions. QMC is a stochastic technique that samples configurations of the system according to their Boltzmann weight. Early applications by researchers like White et al. and Loh et al. demonstrated its power for simulating 2D systems [[4,7]]. However, QMC methods are plagued by the infamous **sign problem**, a technical issue where the probability weights in the Monte Carlo sampling can become negative or complex, making the simulation inefficient and often impractical at low temperatures or for certain fillings [[4,7]]. Despite this limitation, ingenious algorithmic improvements, such as determinantal QMC, have allowed for high-precision studies of the 2D Hubbard model, particularly in the weak-to-intermediate coupling regime.\n\nIn recent years, the field has seen a third major paradigm shift with the advent of **tensor network methods**. Building on the principles of DMRG, these methods provide a more flexible and powerful framework for representing the wavefunctions of quantum systems. Techniques like the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) and projected entangled pair states (PEPS) generalize the matrix product states of DMRG to higher dimensions, promising a path around the sign problem that afflicts QMC [[4]]. Although still computationally demanding, these methods are rapidly maturing and are now being applied to challenging problems in the 2D Hubbard model that are beyond the reach of traditional QMC [[4]]. This progression from analytical solutions to deterministic numerical methods like DMRG and then to stochastic methods like QMC, followed by the current push towards tensor networks, illustrates a clear trajectory of leveraging computational power to tackle ever-more complex and realistic physical systems."

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The current computational toolkit for tackling the Hubbard model is diverse and powerful, with different methods specialized for different regimes of parameter space and physical questions. There is no single \"best\" method; instead, a combination of techniques is often required to build a complete picture. The state-of-the-art can be broadly categorized into three main families: exact methods for small systems, stochastic methods for larger systems, and variational methods for capturing entanglement.\n\n**Exact Diagonalization (ED) and its extensions** remain a vital tool, particularly for benchmarking other methods and studying fundamental properties in very small systems. By directly diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix in a chosen basis, ED provides access to the entire spectrum of eigenenergies and eigenstates with machine precision. Modern implementations often use advanced techniques like Lanczos recursion to target specific states (e.g., the ground state) more efficiently. Extensions of ED, such as the **Cumulant Green's Function Method (CGFM)**, move beyond calculating energies to compute dynamic quantities. CGFM uses exact diagonalization as a starting point to construct an expansion for Green's functions, enabling the study of density profiles and phase diagrams in, for example, the 1D Hubbard model subjected to a magnetic field [[9]]. While limited by system size, these methods provide invaluable exact data for testing the accuracy of approximate theories.\n\n**Stochastic Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods** are the workhorse for simulating the Hubbard model in two and three dimensions, especially for studying equilibrium properties at finite temperature. The primary advantage of QMC is its favorable scaling with system size compared to exact methods, allowing simulations of lattices with thousands of sites. The most prominent variant for the Hubbard model is **Determinantal QMC (DQMC)**, which cleverly handles the fermionic nature of electrons by integrating them out, leaving a determinant in the partition function. This allows for efficient sampling. DQMC has been instrumental in mapping out the phase diagram of the 2D Hubbard model, investigating antiferromagnetic order, and studying pairing correlations relevant to superconductivity [[4,7]]. The main limitation, however, is the **sign problem**, which becomes severe at low temperatures, low doping, and for frustrated lattices, rendering simulations impossible in these regions [[4,7]]. Researchers actively develop algorithmic fixes and alternative formulations to mitigate this issue, but it remains a fundamental barrier.\n\n**Tensor Network States (TNS)** represent the most exciting frontier in the numerical simulation of quantum many-body systems. These methods are built on the observation that the ground states of local Hamiltonians in one dimension obey an area law for entanglement entropy, meaning their entanglement scales with the boundary of a region, not its volume. This makes them amenable to efficient representation. The **Matrix Product State (MPS)**, the parent class of DMRG, has proven incredibly successful for 1D chains [[4]]. Generalizations to two dimensions, such as **Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS)** and **Multi-scale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA)**, are being actively pursued to overcome the sign problem in higher dimensions. These methods represent the wavefunction as a network of tensors, where the bond dimension of the network controls the amount of entanglement that can be captured. Recent applications include using TNS to investigate competing orders in the triangular lattice Hubbard model and to study Mott insulating states [[4]]. While computationally more expensive than QMC, TNS offer the promise of unbiased access to the thermodynamic limit and the ability to explore parameter regimes that are currently inaccessible.\n\nA summary of the strengths and weaknesses of these key methods is presented in the table below.\n\n| Method | Strengths | Weaknesses |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Exact Diagonalization (ED)** | Provides exact, non-perturbative results; calculates entire spectrum; serves as a high-quality benchmark. | Limited to very small system sizes (typically < 50 sites); struggles with frustration. |\n| **Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)** | High accuracy for accessible parameter regimes; scales well with system size; handles thermal fluctuations naturally. | Severely hampered by the sign problem; restricted to specific geometries and fillings; cannot easily access real-time dynamics. |\n| **DMRG / Tensor Networks (TN)** | Excellent for 1D systems; can achieve very high accuracy; captures ground-state entanglement structure well; can be extended to 2D (PEPS). | Scaling becomes prohibitive in 2D; TN methods are often more complex to implement than QMC; requires careful handling of symmetries. |\n| **Diagrammatic Methods (e.g., DMFT)** | Scales well with system size; provides self-consistent local quantum impurity solver; excellent for studying local quantum criticality. | Approximate; relies on impurity solver accuracy; misses non-local spatial correlations; less effective for systems with strong spatial order. |\n\nThis diversity of methods ensures that progress is being made across the entire phase diagram of the Hubbard model, with each technique contributing unique insights and pushing the boundaries of what is computationally possible."

      "content": "The computational study of the Hubbard model has yielded profound insights into a wide range of physical phenomena, transforming our understanding of strongly correlated materials. The model serves as a bridge between abstract theoretical concepts and concrete experimental observations, with applications spanning from high-temperature superconductors to quantum simulation platforms.\n\nOne of the most significant applications is in the theoretical investigation of **high-temperature superconductivity**. The discovery of cuprate superconductors in 1986 immediately focused attention on the two-dimensional Hubbard model as a potential microscopic origin for the pairing mechanism [[1]]. While the model itself does not contain a pairing term, it is believed that strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations, which are a key feature of the model's antiferromagnetic ground state at half-filling, can act as the \"glue\" that binds electrons into Cooper pairs. Computational studies using DMRG and QMC have extensively investigated the nature of these spin fluctuations and the possibility of various types of superconducting order, such as d-wave pairing [[7]]. For instance, numerical work by Assaad and Imada calculated the Hall coefficient for the 2D Hubbard model, providing a link to transport measurements in cuprates [[7]], while other studies have explored strange metallicity and quasiparticle dispersion [[7]]. Despite decades of effort, a definitive proof that the simple Hubbard model alone is sufficient to explain high-Tc superconductivity remains one of the greatest unsolved problems in condensed matter physics.\n\nAnother major application lies in the realm of **quantum simulation with cold atoms**. Since the early 2000s, ultracold atoms confined in optical lattices have emerged as a premier platform for realizing and studying the Hubbard model in a highly controlled laboratory setting [[1]]. The ability to tune the interaction strength `U`, the tunneling `t`, and the lattice geometry has allowed for direct experimental tests of theoretical predictions. A landmark experiment by Greiner et al. realized the Bose-Hubbard model and observed the sharp superfluid-to-Mott insulator quantum phase transition [[1]]. Following this, Jördens et al. successfully implemented the fermionic Hubbard model with lithium atoms, directly imaging the phase separation between different phases and measuring the compressibility to probe the Mott gap [[1]]. These experiments have validated many of the qualitative features predicted by theory and have opened up new avenues for studying nonequilibrium dynamics and entanglement in quantum systems. The close collaboration between theorists using DMRG and QMC and experimentalists working with cold atoms has created a powerful feedback loop, driving progress in both fields.\n\nMore recently, the Hubbard model has become a key theoretical tool for understanding novel materials known as **twisted van der Waals heterostructures**. In particular, twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) like WSe2/WS2 can host nearly flat moiré bands where the kinetic energy is strongly suppressed compared to the on-site repulsion `U` [[9]]. This leads to a realization of the Hubbard model with an extremely large effective `U/W` ratio, placing these systems in a deeply quantum-mechanical regime. Theoretical studies using slave-particle formalisms and other techniques have shown that such strong correlations can drive exotic phenomena like unconventional magnetism and potentially novel forms of superconductivity [[9]]. This connection between the canonical Hubbard model and cutting-edge materials science highlights its continued relevance and adaptability to describe emerging frontiers in condensed matter physics.\n\nThe following table summarizes key case studies and their corresponding computational methods.\n\n| Application Area | Physical Phenomenon Studied | Representative Computational Methods | Key Findings & Insights |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **High-Temperature Superconductors** | Origin of d-wave pairing, antiferromagnetic fluctuations, quasiparticle dispersion. | DMRG, Determinantal QMC, Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT). | Strong evidence that antiferromagnetic fluctuations are a key ingredient for pairing; ongoing debate on the precise pairing mechanism [[1,7]]. |\n| **Cold Atom Quantum Simulation** | Superfluid-Mott insulator transition, phase separation, quench dynamics. | Exact Diagonalization (ED), Time-evolving Block Decimation (TEBD), DMRG. | Direct experimental observation of the Mott transition confirmed theoretical predictions [[1]]; demonstration of the Hubbard model as a universal simulator. |\n| **Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides** | Strongly correlated flat-band physics, unconventional magnetism, potential for exotic superconductivity. | Slave-particle approaches, strong-coupling expansions, Variational Cluster Approach (VCA). | Realization of a strongly correlated triangular-lattice Hubbard model, suggesting pathways to novel quantum states [[9]]. |\n| **Quasi-One-Dimensional Materials** | Experimental verification of spin-charge separation. | Bethe ansatz, Thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA), Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). | Clear signatures of spin-charge separation observed in materials like SrCuO2, validating the 1D Hubbard model solution [[11]]. |\n\nThese diverse applications underscore the versatility of the Hubbard model as a theoretical framework and the indispensable role of computation in unlocking its predictive power."

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Despite six decades of intense research and the development of sophisticated computational tools, the Hubbard model continues to present formidable challenges and harbors numerous open questions that lie at the heart of modern condensed matter physics. These difficulties are not merely technical but touch upon fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics and statistical physics.\n\nThe most persistent and widely recognized challenge is the **sign problem** in Quantum Monte Carlo simulations [[4,7]]. This issue prevents QMC from being applied reliably to the Hubbard model at low temperatures and low doping, precisely the parameter regime where the most interesting physics of high-Tc superconductivity is expected to occur. While various mitigation strategies exist, such as dual fermion approaches and continuous-time QMC, they do not eliminate the problem entirely. This computational bottleneck severely limits our ability to perform unbiased, first-principles calculations in the parameter space most relevant to experiments. The search for a practical solution to the sign problem remains a holy grail for the field.\n\nA second major challenge is the difficulty of accurately treating **non-local correlations**. Many powerful computational methods, including DMRG and DMFT, are designed to capture local or short-range correlations exceptionally well but struggle to describe long-range order and topological phenomena. For example, while DMRG excels at finding the ground state of a 1D chain, extending it to two dimensions is computationally prohibitive, and its performance can degrade in the presence of long-range antiferromagnetic order. Similarly, DMFT treats spatial fluctuations only at the mean-field level, missing crucial aspects of spatial correlations that are likely important for pairing mechanisms. Developing methods that can simultaneously capture both strong local correlations and delicate, long-range entanglement remains a grand challenge.\n\nBeyond these technical hurdles, there are profound **open physical questions**. The most famous is the **mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity**. While the Hubbard model is a prime candidate to describe the normal state of cuprates, a consensus on the pairing glue has not been reached. Is it primarily antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations? Or do other factors, such as charge-density waves or orbital currents, play a more significant role? The answer likely depends sensitively on the model's parameters, and resolving this question requires access to a much wider range of `U/t`, doping, and temperature than is currently feasible with existing methods. The lack of a rigorous proof connecting the Hubbard model to the *t*–*J* model further complicates matters [[1]].\n\nFurthermore, the **nature of the pseudogap phase** in cuprates remains mysterious. This phase, observed above the superconducting transition temperature, exhibits a suppression of the electronic density of states but lacks long-range superconducting order. It is unclear whether this phase is a precursor to superconductivity or a competing state of matter. Simulating the crossover from the strange metal phase to the pseudogap and superconducting phases requires techniques capable of handling both thermal and quantum fluctuations on equal footing, a task that pushes the limits of current computational capabilities.\n\nFinally, there is the challenge of **connecting microscopic models to macroscopic observables**. While we can calculate quantities like the ground-state energy or static correlation functions, relating these to the complex transport and spectroscopic data from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is non-trivial. This involves calculating dynamical quantities and convoluting them with instrument resolution functions, which introduces further uncertainties. The development of more robust and reliable methods for computing spectral functions and transport coefficients from microscopic models is an active and crucial area of research. These interconnected challenges—technical, physical, and conceptual—ensure that the Hubbard model will remain a vibrant and central topic of research for the foreseeable future."

      "content": "Looking forward, the computational study of the Hubbard model is poised for continued growth and innovation, driven by the relentless pursuit of solutions to its most persistent challenges and the exploration of new physical frontiers. The synthesis of existing knowledge points toward several promising research directions that aim to enhance our understanding of this paradigmatic model.\n\nA primary future direction is the **development and application of next-generation tensor network methods**. While methods like PEPS are theoretically promising, their computational cost remains a significant barrier. Future work will focus on optimizing these algorithms, developing better truncation schemes, and applying them to increasingly larger and more complex systems. The goal is to create a practical, unbiased tool that can rival QMC in efficiency while avoiding the sign problem. This would allow for high-precision calculations in the physically relevant regimes of the 2D Hubbard model, potentially shedding light on the nature of the pseudogap and the pairing mechanism in high-Tc superconductors. Furthermore, hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of tensor networks with other methods, such as embedding techniques, may offer a pragmatic path to overcoming current limitations [[4]].\n\nAnother key area of future research is the **integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence** with traditional computational physics. Machine learning techniques are already being used to classify phases of matter and identify order parameters automatically. In the context of the Hubbard model, AI could be employed to design more efficient sampling strategies for QMC, to optimize the bond dimensions in tensor network states, or to discover new ansatz wavefunctions that capture complex entanglement structures. This synergy between data-driven methods and first-principles calculations holds the potential to unlock new levels of predictive power and accelerate scientific discovery.\n\nThe field will also continue to leverage **novel quantum simulation platforms**. Beyond cold atoms, solid-state quantum computers and analog simulators based on trapped ions or superconducting circuits are emerging as powerful tools for probing the Hubbard model [[7]]. These platforms offer the prospect of directly simulating the Hamiltonian in regimes that are intractable for classical computers. For instance, simulating the real-time dynamics of a quantum quench or exploring the effects of disorder and geometry in ways not possible in solids could reveal new universal behaviors and provide stringent tests for theoretical models. The interplay between theory, classical simulation, and quantum simulation will be a defining feature of the coming decade.\n\nTo conclude, the journey of the Hubbard model from a theoretical curiosity to a central pillar of condensed matter physics exemplifies the symbiotic relationship between fundamental theory and computational science. The model’s enduring appeal lies in its deceptive simplicity and its capacity to generate profound complexity. Our review has traced its history, from the analytical triumph of the Bethe ansatz to the numerical dominance of DMRG and QMC, and now to the promising horizon of tensor networks and AI-assisted methods. The primary legacy of this research is not just the accumulation of numerical results, but the development of a rich suite of computational tools and concepts that have transformed our ability to understand strongly correlated systems. The unresolved questions—the mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity, the fate of the pseudogap, and the ultimate impact of the sign problem—serve as a testament to the model's depth and as a clear roadmap for the future. Solving these puzzles will require not only incremental improvements to existing methods but also bold new ideas that push the boundaries of computation and our fundamental understanding of quantum matter.\n\n---"
