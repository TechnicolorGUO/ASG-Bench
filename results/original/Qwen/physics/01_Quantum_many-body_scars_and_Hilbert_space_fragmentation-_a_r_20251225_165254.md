## Introduction: The Emergence of Non-Ergodicity in Many-Body Quantum Systems

The foundational principle of statistical mechanics, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), posits that individual energy eigenstates of a closed, generic many-body quantum system encode thermal equilibrium properties. This implies that such systems are ergodic, meaning their long-time dynamics are independent of initial conditions and explore the entirety of the accessible region in their Hilbert space. However, a growing body of theoretical and experimental work has revealed a rich landscape of exceptions to this paradigm, where systems fail to thermalize despite being non-integrable. Two of the most prominent phenomena in this field are quantum many-body scars (QMBS) and Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF). These mechanisms represent distinct pathways to weak ergodicity breaking, giving rise to novel dynamical phases with long-lived coherence, persistent oscillations, and non-thermal steady states. The study of these topics has profound implications for our understanding of quantum statistical mechanics, quantum information scrambling, and the potential for harnessing controlled, coherent dynamics in complex quantum simulators.

QMBS were first identified as a microscopic mechanism explaining the anomalously large overlap of certain eigenstates with simple product states in specific spin chains, such as the PXP model derived from Rydberg atom systems [[8,10]]. These scarred eigenstates violate the ETH and lead to revivals and persistent oscillations after certain quantum quenches, a behavior at odds with thermalizing systems [[3]]. HSF, also known as spectral universality or emergent classicality, describes a more radical form of non-ergodicity where the vast Hilbert space of a system decomposes into an exponential number of dynamically disconnected subspaces, termed Krylov sectors [[2,7]]. Within each sector, dynamics can be trivially simple, leading to complete freezing of subsystems or other forms of non-thermal behavior [[7]]. While initially studied in one-dimensional models, both phenomena have been shown to extend to higher dimensions and diverse physical platforms, including gauge theories, fermionic systems, and photonic lattices [[1,6]].

This review focuses on the body of "exact results" pertaining to QMBS and HSF. Here, "exact" is interpreted broadly to encompass analytically solvable models, rigorously proven theorems, and highly precise numerical solutions that provide definitive evidence for the existence and properties of these phenomena. The objective is to synthesize the current understanding of these two intertwined concepts, tracing their historical development, detailing the key models and methods used to establish their existence, exploring their applications across different physical systems, and critically assessing the remaining challenges and future research directions. By focusing on exact results, we aim to build a firm foundation of established facts upon which more general theories can be built. This review will highlight how these seemingly disparate phenomena—non-thermal eigenstates and fragmented state spaces—are often two sides of the same coin, providing deep insights into the fundamental limits of quantum thermalization and the surprising complexity that can emerge from simple local interactions.

## Key Concepts and Foundational Mechanisms

To understand the literature on quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation, it is essential to define the core concepts and distinguish between related but distinct phenomena. These terms describe various manifestations of weak ergodicity breaking, where a system's dynamics do not explore its entire Hilbert space, but they arise from different underlying principles and exhibit different signatures.

**Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS)** refer to a set of non-thermal eigenstates embedded within the otherwise thermal spectrum of a many-body Hamiltonian. These states possess significantly lower entanglement entropy than typical thermal eigenstates of the same energy density and, crucially, have a much larger overlap with simple, often unentangled, product states compared to what would be expected from random matrix theory [[3,10]]. The term "scar" originates from the analogy with quantum scarring in single-particle chaotic systems, where wavefunctions show enhanced probability density along unstable periodic orbits of the corresponding classical system [[5]]. In the many-body context, this translates to the wavefunction having a significant amplitude on a small subset of basis states that are connected by low-order processes. A hallmark signature of QMBS is the observation of long-lived coherent oscillations in real-time dynamics following a quantum quench from a simple initial state, such as a charge-density wave [[3]]. A classic example is the PXP model, $H = \Omega \sum_i P_{i-1}^0 \sigma_i^x P_{i+1}^0$, which arises as an effective description of a chain of Rydberg atoms under strong blockade conditions; here, the scar states lead to robust revivals even though the system is non-integrable [[8]]. More recent work has shown that genuine scars can exist within the thermal part of the spectrum itself, arising from unstable periodic orbits in the semi-classical limit of spin models, without requiring fine-tuning to special non-thermal states [[5]].

**Hilbert Space Fragmentation (HSF)** is a more fundamental and severe form of non-ergodicity. It occurs when the presence of kinematic constraints causes the total Hilbert space to decompose into an exponential number of smaller, dynamically disconnected subspaces, known as Krylov subspaces or Krylov sectors [[2,7]]. Any state initialized within a given sector will remain confined to it for all time, rendering the dynamics within that subspace completely non-thermal. This phenomenon was famously demonstrated in the "folded XXZ model," a spin-1/2 chain where particle number conservation leads to an exponential number of degenerate energy levels, with the degeneracy depending on the particle content of the state [[2]]. The consequences of HSF are stark: if a simple initial state happens to lie in a frozen sector, the entire system will appear to stop evolving, a phenomenon observed in experiments on two-dimensional tilted Bose-Hubbard models with quantum gas microscopy [[7]]. The excitations within these constrained systems can exhibit exotic properties like fractonic behavior, where particles are immobile or restricted to move along lower-dimensional submanifolds, as observed directly in the same experiment [[7]]. The connection between HSF and QMBS is clear: any conserved quantity that fragments the Hilbert space can create the very environment necessary for QMBS to exist, as the scar states are then confined to evolve within a reduced, non-thermal sector.

A third, closely related concept is **weak ergodicity breaking**, which serves as an umbrella term for both QMBS and HSF. It refers to any situation where a system fails to thermalize due to a breakdown of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). The distinction lies in the degree of failure. In a system with HSF, the failure is total within a given sector; the system is not ergodic at all. In a system with QMBS, the system is still globally thermalizing, but its ergodicity is "weak" because the scarred eigenstates form a measure-zero subset of the full spectrum that dominates the dynamics starting from certain simple initial states [[5]]. The table below summarizes the key distinctions.

| Feature | Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) | Hilbert Space Fragmentation (HSF) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | A set of non-thermal eigenstates with low entanglement and large overlap with product states, embedded in a thermal spectrum [[3,10]]. | Decomposition of the total Hilbert space into an exponential number of dynamically disconnected Krylov subspaces due to kinematic constraints [[2,7]]. |
| **Ergodicity Breaking** | Weak; system is thermalizing but scarred eigenstates dominate dynamics from special initial states [[5]]. | Strong; dynamics within a given Krylov sector are completely non-thermal [[7]]. |
| **Primary Signature** | Long-lived coherent oscillations and revivals in real-time dynamics after a quantum quench [[3]]. | Complete freezing of subsystems or simple, predictable dynamics within a sector [[7]]. |
| **Origin** | Localized structures in Hilbert space (e.g., based on SU(2) algebras [[4]] or classical periodic orbits [[5]]). | Kinematic constraints (e.g., local conservation laws, forbidding certain atomic configurations) [[2,7]]. |
| **Example Model** | PXP model [[8]], Fibonacci chain [[3]], Folded XXZ model [[2]]. | Folded XXZ model [[2]], Rydberg constraint models [[6]], Tilted Bose-Hubbard model [[7]]. |

These three concepts—QMBS, HSF, and weak ergodicity breaking—are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they represent a spectrum of non-thermal behavior. HSF provides the structural framework, creating the segregated state space. Within these segregated sectors, QMBS can manifest as a special collection of non-thermal eigenstates that defy the ETH. Understanding this interplay is central to modern research in non-equilibrium quantum physics.

## Historical Development and Milestones in Solvable Models

The journey towards understanding quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation began with the study of integrable models, whose exact solvability provided a baseline for what was considered possible in quantum dynamics. However, the true revolution started with the discovery of non-integrable systems that defied conventional wisdom about thermalization. The development of the field can be traced through several key milestones, moving from one-dimensional spin chains to higher dimensions and diverse physical platforms.

The seminal work that brought QMBS to the forefront was the 2018 paper by C.J. Turner et al. in *Nature Physics*, which introduced the concept using the PXP model as a primary example [[3,9]]. This model, describing a chain of Rydberg atoms with a strong nearest-neighbor blockade interaction, was found to be non-integrable yet exhibited a series of low-energy eigenstates with extremely low entanglement. These states, dubbed "scars," had a surprisingly large overlap with a simple Neel-like product state. When the system was prepared in this state and allowed to evolve, it did not thermalize but instead showed robust, long-lived coherent oscillations—a direct violation of the ETH. This work was soon followed by another influential paper from the same group, published in *Physical Review B*, which generalized the concept and proposed a classification scheme for such non-thermal eigenstates [[4,9]]. Around the same time, the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) spin-1 chain was re-examined as another prime example of a system with exact, non-thermal eigenstates [[10]].

A pivotal shift occurred with the 2021 work by Pizzi et al., who challenged the prevailing notion that QMBS were rare, fine-tuned phenomena associated only with non-thermal states [[5]]. Using a combination of exact diagonalization and phase-space projection techniques, they demonstrated that in generic spin-1/2 chains with short-range interactions, there exists a vast number of thermal eigenstates that are "scars." These scars arise when the underlying classical dynamics of the spin system possess unstable periodic orbits (UPOs). The condition for scarring, $\lambda/\omega < 1$ (where $\lambda$ is the Lyapunov exponent and $\omega$ is the frequency of the orbit), holds across broad parameter regimes, and the number of such scarred eigenstates grows exponentially with system size [[5]]. This insight, linking quantum scars to classical chaos, was a major conceptual advance, suggesting that QMBS might be a more ubiquitous feature of interacting quantum systems than previously thought.

The discovery of HSF was driven by the realization that kinematic constraints could be just as powerful as integrability in preventing thermalization. A cornerstone of this development was the 2021 paper introducing the "folded XXZ model," a spin-1/2 chain with a specific pattern of XXZ couplings that led to constant scattering lengths and enabled exact solutions for the spectrum and dynamics [[2]]. This model explicitly demonstrated Hilbert space fragmentation, with an exponential number of degenerate energy levels corresponding to different particle numbers. The authors provided an alternative derivation of the model's Hamiltonian and mapped it onto the well-known SU(3) XX (Maassarani-Mathieu) spin chain, establishing a deep algebraic connection [[2]]. This work provided a concrete, analytical example of HSF and showed how it could lead to a breakdown of equilibration for certain initial states [[2]].

The frontier of research rapidly expanded beyond one-dimensional spin chains. A landmark experimental demonstration of HSF was reported in 2024 by Liao et al. in *Science* [[7]]. Using quantum gas microscopy to probe a two-dimensional tilted Bose-Hubbard model with 87Rb atoms, they observed the direct formation of fractonic excitations and the decomposition of the Hilbert space into exponentially many dynamically decoupled sectors [[7]]. This work was particularly insightful because it showed how the relaxation dynamics depended sensitively on the initial state preparation, with some states remaining frozen while others relaxed, all within the same energy and particle-number manifold. On the theoretical front, progress continued with the construction of new families of solvable models. A 2025 paper by Yuan Miao presented a versatile method for generating exact QMBS in two-dimensional systems by exploiting a duality transformation between a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory and a spin-1/2 XY model on bipartite graphs [[1]]. This approach successfully produced exact scar towers in higher dimensions, overcoming a significant barrier to the broader applicability of the QMBS concept. The timeline below summarizes these key developments.

This progression illustrates a clear trend: from isolated examples to general principles, from one dimension to higher dimensions, and from theoretical models to direct experimental observation. The field is now characterized by a deepening understanding of the mathematical structures—such as algebraic relations, classical dynamics, and topological constraints—that give rise to non-ergodic behavior.

## Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques for Identifying Exact States

The identification and characterization of quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation rely on a diverse toolkit of analytical, numerical, and experimental techniques. The ability to find and verify exact results is paramount for building a rigorous understanding of these phenomena. The methods range from exploiting underlying symmetries and algebraic structures to applying sophisticated machine learning algorithms to raw simulation data.

One of the most powerful approaches for finding exact results is to leverage the algebraic structure of a model's Hamiltonian. Several studies have demonstrated that models built from su(2) algebraic relations are fertile ground for discovering QMBS [[4]]. For instance, a general method for constructing one-dimensional spin chains with QMBS was proposed, which is applicable to high-spin systems and reduces to the PXP model under specific parameter choices [[4]]. Similarly, the xorX model possesses an exact conserved quantity, the domain wall number, which allows for the analytical construction of a family of scar states [[8]]. This conserved quantity is responsible for the Hilbert space fragmentation in this model, highlighting the deep connection between algebraic structure and non-thermal behavior. Another technique involves mapping one model to another with known exact solutions. The 2025 work by Yuan Miao exemplifies this by deriving a two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model that exhibits exact QMBS through a duality transformation from the well-understood XXZ model [[1]]. This method provides a versatile recipe for generating new, higher-dimensional scarred systems. The Bethe ansatz method has also been successfully applied to solve specific constrained fermionic models, yielding exact expressions for eigenstates and eigenenergies and allowing for the calculation of quantities like entanglement entropy [[6]].

While algebraic methods yield elegant, analytical results, they are often limited to highly symmetric or fine-tuned models. For more generic systems, numerical methods become indispensable. **Exact diagonalization (ED)** remains a cornerstone technique, allowing for the full diagonalization of the Hamiltonian for relatively small system sizes. This provides access to the entire spectrum of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, enabling detailed studies of level statistics, entanglement properties, and overlaps with simple product states [[5,8]]. ED is crucial for identifying scar states numerically and verifying their non-thermal character. For larger systems or for studying time evolution, **Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPO)** simulations are employed. These methods, often implemented with tools like TeNPy, allow for the efficient simulation of time evolution governed by local Hamiltonians, even in one-dimensional systems [[7]]. They are particularly useful for modeling experiments and comparing simulated dynamics with measured quantities like occupation imbalances [[7]].

Perhaps the most innovative and promising recent development is the application of **machine learning**, specifically quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), to the problem of scar identification [[8]]. QCNNs are trained to recognize patterns in quantum states, effectively learning to distinguish scarred eigenstates from thermal ones. This technique has proven remarkably successful. In the xorX and PXP models, QCNNs achieved over 99% accuracy in single-shot measurements of known scar states [[8]]. Crucially, the network also identified previously unknown non-thermal states in both models, revealing hidden structures in the spectrum that were not apparent from analytical considerations alone [[8]]. The power of this approach is further demonstrated by its successful implementation on actual IBM quantum devices, where error-mitigated QCNNs still achieved accuracies exceeding 63%, showcasing a viable path toward identifying scars in near-term quantum hardware [[8]]. This represents a paradigm shift, where machine learning acts as a powerful exploratory tool to navigate the vast Hilbert space and discover exact structures that are otherwise hidden.

Finally, experimental techniques have matured to the point where they can directly probe these phenomena. **Quantum gas microscopy** allows for site-resolved imaging of ultracold atoms in optical lattices, enabling the direct observation of HSF in a two-dimensional tilted Bose-Hubbard model [[7]]. Researchers can prepare specific initial states (e.g., checkerboard, dimer) and track the subsequent dynamics, observing the emergence of frozen regions and the propagation of fractonic excitations [[7]]. In the context of Rydberg atom simulators, which were instrumental in the initial discovery of QMBS, quantum quench experiments are the standard protocol. By suddenly changing a system parameter and monitoring the time evolution of observables, researchers can directly observe the signature long-lived oscillations characteristic of scar dynamics [[3]]. Together, these methods—from abstract algebra to numerical simulation and cutting-edge experimentation—form a multi-pronged assault that is progressively unveiling the intricate landscape of non-ergodic quantum matter.

## Applications and Case Studies of Exact Non-Ergodic Behavior

The theoretical exploration of quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation has rapidly translated into a diverse array of physical systems, ranging from engineered atomic arrays to fundamental condensed matter models. These case studies illustrate the versatility of the underlying principles and their relevance across different domains of physics. By examining specific examples, we can see how the abstract concepts of fragmented Hilbert spaces and scarred eigenstates manifest in tangible ways.

One of the most prominent and experimentally realized platforms is the **Rydberg atom quantum simulator**. The PXP model, $H = \Omega \sum_i \Pi_{j\neq i} (1 - \ket{j}\bra{j}) \sigma_i^x \Pi_{k\neq i} (1 - \ket{k}\bra{k})$, serves as the effective Hamiltonian for a chain of atoms where each atom can be excited to a high-lying Rydberg state [[8]]. The blockade interaction ensures that no two excited atoms can be adjacent. This hard-core constraint is a simple form of Hilbert space fragmentation, as it removes certain configurations from the Hilbert space. This model hosts a family of exact scar states, which are responsible for the celebrated long-lived coherent oscillations observed in experiments [[3,8]]. The fidelity of these observations in systems of up to 51 atoms underscores the robustness of QMBS against imperfections and noise [[3]]. Further studies of the PXP model have explored the transition from non-integrable to integrable behavior by tuning parameters, revealing how the nature of the scar states evolves [[4]].

Another class of models exhibiting QMBS arises from **spin chains with SU(2) algebraic structure**. A general method for constructing such models in one-dimensional spin chains was proposed, which can be applied to high-spin systems [[4]]. This approach shows that the scarred states can be understood as arising from a single-particle hopping model on the graph of the Hilbert space, a picture that quantitatively captures the scarred wave functions up to 32 atoms [[3]]. This demonstrates that the scar phenomenon is deeply rooted in the representation theory of Lie algebras. The xorX model is a specific example where an exact conserved quantity leads to both HSF and a family of analytically known scar states [[8]]. Machine learning techniques have further revealed that this model also contains other non-thermal eigenstates, expanding the known landscape of scar-like structures [[8]].

The concept of HSF has been dramatically illustrated in **constrained fermionic systems**. A one-dimensional spinless fermion model with Rydberg-blockade-like constraints, where double occupancy of neighboring sites is forbidden, provides an exactly solvable example [[6]]. The Hamiltonian conserves the total particle number, which immediately fragments the Hilbert space into exponentially many sectors labeled by the number of particles. Despite this fragmentation, the ground state obeys an area law for entanglement entropy, highlighting the subtle interplay between constraints and entanglement [[6]]. This model serves as a valuable laboratory for understanding how kinetic constraints shape the structure of the Hilbert space and influence thermalization.

Perhaps the most striking experimental confirmation of HSF comes from studies of the **two-dimensional tilted Bose-Hubbard model** [[7]]. Using quantum gas microscopy, researchers prepared the system in different initial states all with the same energy and particle number. They observed markedly different dynamics: a checkerboard state remained almost perfectly frozen, while a dimer state relaxed before entering a slow decay regime [[7]]. This differential relaxation is a direct consequence of HSF. The system's evolution is projected onto different Krylov sectors, some of which contain frozen degrees of freedom. The experiment also provided the first direct observation of fractonic excitations—quasiparticles that cannot move freely but are instead confined to one-dimensional lines or points, a consequence of the strong kinetic constraints [[7]]. This work solidified the connection between HSF and the emergence of exotic quasiparticles with subdimensional mobility.

More recently, the boundaries of these phenomena have been pushed into **higher dimensions and more abstract settings**. The 2025 paper by Yuan Miao constructed a two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory that is dual to a spin-1/2 XY model [[1]]. This model features exact QMBS that exhibit a tower of states, providing a method to construct scarred systems in dimensions beyond one [[1]]. Another avenue of exploration is connecting these models to **quantum field theories (QFTs)**. The folded XXZ model has been linked to $T\bar{T}$-deformed QFTs and hard rod deformations, suggesting deep connections between the discrete, lattice-based phenomena of HSF and continuous field theories [[2]]. These diverse applications demonstrate that the principles of QMBS and HSF are not mere curiosities but are fundamental organizing principles governing the dynamics of a wide variety of quantum systems.

## Critical Analysis: Challenges, Open Problems, and Research Gaps

Despite the remarkable progress in identifying and characterizing exact results for quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation, the field is fraught with significant challenges, open questions, and critical research gaps. The rapid pace of discovery has generated more questions than it has answered, pushing the frontiers of theoretical and experimental physics. A critical analysis reveals several key areas that require deeper investigation to achieve a complete and unified understanding of non-ergodicity.

One of the most pressing challenges is the **generalization of concepts from one dimension to higher dimensions**. While numerous examples of QMBS and HSF have been found in one-dimensional systems, the mechanisms and stability of these phenomena in two and three dimensions are far less understood. The 2025 work by Yuan Miao on a 2D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model is a notable exception, providing a constructive proof of principle for 2D scars [[1]]. However, it remains unclear whether such scars are generic in 2D systems, analogous to how classical periodic orbits are ubiquitous in 2D classical dynamics. A major open problem is to develop a systematic understanding of how Hilbert space fragmentation scales with dimensionality and whether it gives rise to qualitatively new phenomena, such as higher-dimensional analogues of fractons. The experimental observation of HSF and fractons in a 2D atomic system is a crucial first step, but much more work is needed to map out the phase diagram of non-ergodic behavior in higher dimensions [[7]].

A second major challenge lies in **understanding the role of disorder and perturbations**. Most exact results discussed so far pertain to translationally invariant, clean systems. However, in real materials and many experiments, disorder is inevitable. A key question is how QMBS and HSF respond to disorder. Do the scarred states survive? Do they get Anderson localized? Or does disorder drive a transition into a many-body localized (MBL) phase, which is another form of ergodicity breaking? The interplay between the algebraic or kinematic origins of non-ergodicity and the effects of randomness is largely uncharted territory. Furthermore, it is important to determine the stability of these states under generic perturbations that break the underlying algebraic symmetries or constraints. Are the scars fragile, disappearing under small changes to the Hamiltonian, or are they robust, protected by some emergent mechanism?

Third, there is a need for a **more comprehensive theoretical framework** that can unify the diverse mechanisms for non-ergodicity. Currently, the field is populated by a multitude of disconnected models—some based on SU(2) algebras, others on classical periodic orbits, and still others on kinematic constraints. While connections are being made, such as the link between the PXP model and the AKLT chain [[10]], a grand unified theory is lacking. A significant research gap exists in developing a classification scheme for QMBS and HSF that goes beyond specific examples. Such a framework would ideally predict which classes of Hamiltonians are likely to host scars or exhibit fragmentation, based on properties like symmetry, locality, and the nature of interactions. Progress in this direction would transform our understanding from a catalog of exceptional cases to a predictive science of non-thermal behavior.

Fourth, the **connection to thermodynamics and transport remains poorly understood**. While much is known about the energy spectrum and static properties of scarred states, their impact on macroscopic observables like conductivity, diffusion constants, and thermal transport is an active area of research. How does the presence of a few scarred states affect the overall thermalization time of the system? Can HSF lead to unusual transport properties, such as diverging length scales or anomalous diffusion? Answering these questions requires going beyond the study of individual eigenstates and calculating dynamical correlation functions, a task that is computationally demanding and analytically challenging.

Finally, a critical gap exists in the **experimental verification of predicted phenomena**. While the observation of HSF in a 2D atomic system is a landmark achievement [[7]], many predictions remain purely theoretical. For example, the prediction of a tower of scar states in the dual 2D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model needs to be tested in a suitable cold atom or ion trap setup [[1]]. Similarly, the proposal to use tailored dissipation to stabilize QMBS in open systems requires experimental implementation [[9]]. There is a clear need for more collaborations between theorists and experimentalists to design and execute experiments that can directly test the more exotic predictions of the field, such as the transport properties of scarred systems or the manipulation of fractonic excitations. Overcoming these challenges will be essential for the field to mature from a collection of fascinating counterexamples to thermalization into a robust and predictive branch of condensed matter physics.

## Conclusion: Synthesizing the Landscape of Exact Non-Ergodicity

In summary, the systematic review of exact results on quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation reveals a vibrant and rapidly advancing field that has fundamentally altered our understanding of thermalization in isolated quantum systems. The research has moved decisively beyond early, isolated examples to uncover a rich tapestry of non-ergodic phenomena, unified by the common theme of weak ergodicity breaking. The evidence synthesized from analytical models, rigorous proofs, and direct experimental observations demonstrates that the failure of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis is not an anomaly but a robust feature that can emerge from a variety of underlying mechanisms, including algebraic structures, classical chaos, and kinematic constraints.

The journey from the original discovery of QMBS in the PXP model to the recent identification of scars arising from classical periodic orbits in generic spin chains marks a significant conceptual leap [[3,5]]. This work suggests that scars may be a more ubiquitous feature of interacting quantum systems than initially believed, potentially tied to the geometry of the underlying classical phase space. Simultaneously, the formalization of Hilbert space fragmentation has provided a powerful structural explanation for non-thermal behavior, showing how kinematic constraints can partition the Hilbert space into an exponential number of dynamically isolated sectors [[2,7]]. The intimate connection between these two phenomena is becoming increasingly clear: fragmentation creates the stage, while scars are the actors performing non-thermal dynamics upon it.

The field has been propelled forward by a confluence of advanced methods. The exploitation of algebraic structures has yielded a wealth of analytically tractable models, while the advent of machine learning techniques like QCNNs promises to revolutionize the search for new scarred systems in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces [[4,8]]. Numerical methods and, most impressively, direct experimental probes using quantum gas microscopes and Rydberg atom simulators have provided irrefutable evidence for these theoretical predictions, observing scar-induced oscillations and, crucially, the direct formation of fragmented Krylov sectors and exotic fractonic excitations [[3,7]].

However, this progress has illuminated a landscape of profound open questions and challenges. The generalization of these concepts to higher dimensions, the effects of disorder, the development of a unifying theoretical framework, and the connection to macroscopic transport properties stand out as critical frontiers. The coming years will likely focus on addressing these gaps, fostering closer collaboration between theory and experiment to push the boundaries of our knowledge. Ultimately, the study of QMBS and HSF is not merely an academic exercise in challenging textbook dogma; it is a quest to understand the fundamental principles that govern the dynamics of complex quantum matter, with potential implications for quantum information science, the design of novel materials, and our deepest understanding of the laws of physics.
