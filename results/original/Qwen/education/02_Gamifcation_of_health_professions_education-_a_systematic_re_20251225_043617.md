## Introduction and Background

The health professions education landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the need to engage increasingly tech-savvy learners, adapt to diverse educational settings, and prepare graduates for complex clinical environments. Within this context, gamification has emerged as a prominent pedagogical strategy, promising to enhance learner engagement, motivation, and knowledge retention [[20]]. Defined as the application of game design elements—such as points, badges, leaderboards, challenges, and narratives—to non-game educational contexts, gamification seeks to leverage the motivational power of games to solve problems and engage users [[11,17]]. Its conceptual foundation rests on the distinction from related fields like serious games (SG) and game-based learning (GBL). Serious games are fully developed applications designed primarily for educational or training purposes, whereas gamification involves layering game mechanics onto existing activities without fundamentally altering their nature into a game [[3,5]]. Similarly, GBL uses games as the primary vehicle for learning, whereas gamification modifies traditional learning processes [[3]]. This fundamental difference in design intent is the cornerstone of the field's identity.

The motivation for this review stems from the rapid proliferation of gamified interventions across medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and allied health education [[2,13]]. The exponential growth in academic publications, with some analyses noting an increase of nearly tenfold over a five-year period, signals a paradigm shift in how educators approach curriculum design [[5]]. However, this surge in popularity has been accompanied by concerns regarding the methodological rigor and theoretical underpinnings of much of the research. A 2021 systematic review highlighted a pervasive lack of well-defined control groups, poor study quality, and an underuse of theoretical frameworks to explain the mechanisms of action [[3,7]]. This creates a critical knowledge gap: while anecdotal evidence and positive case studies abound, a robust, comprehensive understanding of what constitutes effective gamification, for whom, and under what conditions remains elusive. Furthermore, the ethical dimensions of these highly motivating systems—from potential user anxiety and loss of autonomy to issues of data privacy and cognitive manipulation—are only beginning to be explored systematically [[22,25]].

This systematic literature review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of gamification in health professions education. By synthesizing findings from empirical studies, reviews, and theoretical works, it seeks to address several key questions. First, what are the core components and historical evolution of gamification? Second, what are the most prevalent methods, techniques, and theoretical models being applied? Third, what is the demonstrated impact of these interventions on learning outcomes, and what are the reported implementation challenges? Fourth, what are the major limitations of the current body of research, and where do the critical gaps in knowledge lie? Finally, based on this synthesis, what future directions should guide research and practice to ensure that gamification fulfills its promise as a transformative educational tool? The scope of this review encompasses peer-reviewed articles, conference proceedings, and other scholarly documents focused on health professions education, including medicine, nursing, and pharmacy at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. It will critically examine both digital and analogue applications, drawing exclusively on the provided sources to build a rigorous and insightful analysis.

## Key Concepts and Historical Development

The conceptualization of gamification within health professions education is anchored by a precise definition and a clear differentiation from related constructs. The most widely cited definition, proposed by Deterding et al., frames gamification as "the use of game design elements in non-game contexts" [[5,8,15]]. This definition emphasizes the transfer of specific game mechanics rather than the creation of a complete game experience. In the medical education sphere, this is operationalized through the integration of game-like elements such as points, badges, leaderboards, narrative, levels, feedback loops, and cooperative or competitive mechanics into standard educational activities like lectures, tutorials, and practical skills sessions [[1,10]]. The underlying rationale is to harness the psychological appeal of games to foster deeper engagement and motivation among adult learners [[20]]. This process is often guided by established frameworks that structure these elements into meaningful categories. For instance, Landers' framework adapts concepts from military training simulations to organize game elements into nine attributes: action language, assessment, conflict/challenge, control, environment, game fiction, human interaction, immersion, and rules/goals [[5]]. Other influential frameworks include Susi et al.'s model and Bedwell et al.'s attribute-based system, which have been used to analyze and categorize gamified interventions systematically [[5,18]].

The historical trajectory of gamification reveals a journey from niche applications to mainstream adoption. While the term "gamification" gained prominence in late 2015, its conceptual roots extend back decades [[11]]. One of the earliest documented applications was the HealthPoint program launched in 1989, which rewarded patients for engaging in healthy behaviors with redeemable points [[11]]. The development of Microsoft's interactive CD-ROM game, HealthQuest, in 1993, which educated diabetic patients through puzzles and quizzes, further foreshadowed the potential of digital, game-based health education [[11]]. The modern era of gamification can be traced to the early 2000s, with the first publications appearing in 2009 for serious games and 2012 for gamification itself, according to a scientometric analysis of the medical education literature [[2]]. The publication trend accelerated significantly around 2016, coinciding with the widespread availability of smartphones and mobile applications, which provided new platforms for delivering gamified content [[2,4]]. This period also saw the rise of exergames, spurred by the success of the Nintendo Wii in 2006, which demonstrated that playful physical activity could improve health outcomes [[11]]. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed the adoption of virtual and hybrid forms of gamification, such as the use of online quizzes and virtual simulations to maintain engagement in remote teaching environments like OB-GYN residency programs [[17]].

The global research landscape reflects this growth, though it is characterized by distinct geographical concentrations of activity. A scientometric study identified the United States as the most prolific country in all three domains—gamification, game-based learning, and serious games—with the United Kingdom and the Netherlands following as key contributors [[2]]. Institutions like North Carolina University, London UN, and Amsterdam University were identified as central nodes in the collaboration network [[2]]. Another bibliometric analysis confirmed the U.S. as the leading producer but noted a significant number of publications from Germany and France [[13]]. International collaboration, while present, remains relatively modest, accounting for approximately 10% of publications in one analysis [[4]]. The collaborative nature of the field is evident in the increasing number of multi-author papers, suggesting a move towards more complex, interdisciplinary projects [[2,8]]. Core journals publishing this research include high-impact titles such as *JMIR mHealth and uHealth*, *Journal of Medical Internet Research*, and *JMIR Serious Games* [[2]], indicating a strong focus on technology-enhanced and digitally-delivered interventions. The evolution of the field, from isolated pilot projects to a globally recognized area of inquiry, sets the stage for a deeper investigation into its current methods, applications, and efficacy.

## Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

The application of gamification in health professions education is not monolithic; rather, it encompasses a diverse array of methods and techniques, ranging from simple digital tools to complex, immersive simulations. The most prevalent techniques identified in the literature include digital quizzes and assessments, escape rooms, branching case-based games, and serious games [[13]]. Digital platforms are particularly common, with tools like Kahoot!, Stud2yBuddy, and 'spaced-education' games being frequently cited for their use in immunology teaching, dermatology education, and knowledge retention, respectively [[10,17]]. These platforms typically employ game elements such as points, leaderboards, and time pressure to create a competitive and engaging learning environment [[19]]. For example, a quasi-experimental study involving nursing students found that using Kahoot! after moulage-based CPR training successfully improved self-efficacy [[9]]. Similarly, a randomized controlled trial evaluating the MC-Duell app for evidence-based medicine among medical students utilized real-time matches, scores, and time limits to create a competitive quiz format [[21]]. Beyond simple quizzes, more sophisticated techniques like "spaced education"—which integrates retrieval practice with game mechanics—have shown promise in improving long-term knowledge retention [[17]].

Serious games represent another major category of intervention, often incorporating elements of simulation and narrative to create rich, problem-solving scenarios. Examples in the literature include AntibioGame® for antibiotic stewardship, PediatricSim for pediatric emergencies, and gridlockED for emergency department operations [[17]]. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are pushing the boundaries of immersion, enabling realistic skill acquisition in controlled environments. Studies have highlighted VR-based training for tasks ranging from clinical procedures to reducing preoperative anxiety in children [[8,18]]. Board and card games, branching case-based games, and even "nurse escape rooms" have also been successfully implemented, particularly in nursing education, to teach teamwork, critical thinking, and procedural knowledge in an engaging manner [[8,13]]. These varied techniques share a common goal: to transform passive learning into an active, participatory experience.

The design of these interventions is increasingly informed by structured theoretical frameworks that aim to move beyond superficial point-scoring and toward creating meaningful, psychologically resonant experiences. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is one of the most prominent, positing that well-designed gamification can satisfy innate human needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, thereby fostering intrinsic motivation [[20,23]]. The Octalysis Framework, developed by Yu-Kai Chou, offers a more granular taxonomy, organizing gamification into eight core drivers: Epic Meaning & Calling, Development & Accomplishment, Creative Expression & Feedback, Ownership, Social Influence & Relatedness, Scarcity & Impatience, Unpredictability & Curiosity, and Loss & Avoidance [[16,24]]. A recent randomized controlled trial successfully applied this framework to design a workshop for nurses, resulting in significantly higher evidence-based practice competence compared to a control group [[12]]. Other frameworks include Systemic Gamification Theory (SGT), a holistic model emphasizing the interconnectedness of game elements within their cultural and situational context to promote equity and inclusion [[16]], and the MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics) framework, which provides a structural lens for analyzing game design [[25]]. Despite the existence of these powerful models, a scoping review found that while many studies reference theoretical frameworks, only a small fraction explicitly ground their designs in cognitive theories relevant to clinical reasoning, such as Dual-Process Theory or Cognitive Load Theory [[13]]. This suggests a significant opportunity for future research to deepen the theoretical basis of gamified interventions, ensuring they are not just fun but also cognitively effective.

## Applications and Case Studies

Gamification has been applied across a wide spectrum of health professions education, demonstrating its versatility in addressing different learning objectives, from foundational knowledge acquisition to the development of complex clinical competencies. Medicine and nursing are the most extensively studied disciplines, followed by pharmacy [[13]]. In medicine, gamified interventions have been used to teach subjects as varied as immunology with Kahoot! and dermatology with Stud2yBuddy [[17]]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual gamification was effectively used in OB-GYN resident teaching to increase engagement when in-person contact was limited [[17]]. In nursing education, applications are equally diverse. One study involved using a gamified escape room to teach catheter care, integrating a mobile application for hands-on training [[8]]. Another case study described a flipped classroom where students completed gamified modules before class, allowing for more active learning during face-to-face sessions [[10]]. The table below summarizes several key case studies, illustrating the breadth of gamified approaches and their reported outcomes.

| Study Focus / Population | Intervention Method | Reported Outcomes | Limitations / Notes | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Undergraduate Nursing Students** | Gamified CPR training using Kahoot! vs. role-playing vs. lecture. | Both gamification and role-playing increased self-efficacy more than lectures; role-playing showed a greater impact. | Different session contents between groups; emotional bias in satisfaction ratings. | [[9]] |
| **Medical Students (EBM)** | Competitive e-learning quiz app (MC-Duell). | No significant improvement in risk competence or intrinsic motivation; high rejection of competition element. | Minimal time investment by students; high dropout rate due to rigid scheduling and aversion to direct competition. | [[21]] |
| **Nursing Students** | Clinical skills stations with time pressure, points, certificates ('Squid Game' theme). | Significant improvements in satisfaction (+12.10%) and knowledge (+16.98%). | Theme may have influenced results; no prior gamification experience reported by 75.4% of participants. | [[14]] |
| **Registered Nurses** | Workshop based on Octalysis Framework. | Significantly higher EBP competence (especially in 'acquire' and 'appraise' domains); higher satisfaction and faster report completion. | Primarily female participants; intervention was short-term. | [[12]] |
| **Higher Education Students (OS Course)** | Integrated gamification with points, badges, leaderboards in online and F2F settings. | Significant improvements in success rates, excellence rates, grades, and retention compared to online and F2F controls. | Focused on technical course, may not generalize to all health professions. | [[19]] |
| **Undergraduate Nursing Students** | Gamified lab activities. | Significant improvements in satisfaction and knowledge scores (p < 0.001). | Did not specify the exact game elements used. | [[10]] |

These case studies reveal important insights into the factors that contribute to successful implementation. The study comparing gamification, role-playing, and conventional lectures highlights the importance of active learning, with both gamified and role-playing methods significantly outperforming didactic instruction [[9]]. The finding that role-playing had a slightly greater impact suggests that deep, immersive simulation may offer a more potent form of engagement for certain skills [[9]]. Conversely, the failure of the MC-Duell app underscores the critical importance of alignment with motivational theory. The study's authors suggest that a collaborative, rather than competitive, design might have been more effective, as the direct competition element triggered loss aversion and undermined the need for relatedness, a key component of SDT [[21]]. This points to a crucial nuance: the specific game mechanic must be appropriate for the task and the learner. A competitive leaderboard may motivate top performers but can demotivate those ranked lower, a concern echoed in a Delphi study of Taiwanese medical educators who warned against this potential negative effect [[1]].

Furthermore, the design of the intervention plays a pivotal role. The study that achieved significant gains in evidence-based practice competence used a framework (Octalysis) to deliberately target multiple motivational drivers, including epic meaning, accomplishment, and social influence [[12]]. This contrasts sharply with studies that simply add points and badges without a clear strategic purpose. The longitudinal study at the International Hellenic University provides perhaps the most compelling evidence for the power of well-implemented gamification. By integrating a suite of elements—including leaderboards, badges, and points—into a cohesive scoring algorithm, the researchers created a system that produced statistically significant and substantial improvements in academic performance, motivation, and retention compared to both traditional and online-only formats [[19]]. The success of this intervention demonstrates that when game mechanics are thoughtfully integrated to support learning objectives and satisfy core psychological needs, the results can be transformative. However, the mixed results across these studies also highlight a critical takeaway: there is no single "best" way to gamify education. Success depends on a careful consideration of the context, the learners, the content, and the specific game mechanics employed.

## Challenges and Open Problems

Despite the promising potential of gamification, its implementation in health professions education is fraught with significant challenges and open problems that limit its effectiveness and raise important ethical concerns. One of the most persistent methodological issues is the frequent lack of robust experimental design in the existing body of research. Many studies suffer from small sample sizes, the absence of well-defined control groups, and a reliance on pre-post test designs that cannot establish causality [[7,17]]. A systematic review concluded that the overall quality of studies was poor, citing a lack of randomization and inadequate reporting of theoretical frameworks [[3,7]]. This makes it difficult to discern whether observed effects are truly attributable to the gamified intervention or to confounding variables. Furthermore, the evaluation of these interventions often stops at the level of knowledge acquisition, failing to assess more meaningful outcomes such as changes in clinical performance, patient safety, or long-term behavior change, as noted in the Kirkpatrick Model's higher levels [[17]].

A closely related challenge is the chronic underutilization of theoretical frameworks to guide design and interpretation. While terms like Self-Determination Theory are often mentioned in the discussion section, very few studies actually apply them to justify their design choices [[3,7]]. A review of 44 studies found only seven that attempted to clarify the mechanisms underlying gamification effects using theory [[3]]. This theoretical deficit means that the field is largely reliant on trial-and-error experimentation rather than principled design. Without a solid theoretical foundation, it is impossible to develop a cumulative science of gamification that can explain *why* certain interventions work in some contexts but fail in others. This is compounded by the fact that many studies do not adequately measure or report on the implementation process itself, making it difficult to replicate successful interventions or understand why failed ones failed [[13]].

Beyond methodological shortcomings, there are significant ethical and motivational pitfalls associated with gamification. The use of achievement-based mechanics like leaderboards, points, and badges can inadvertently foster social comparison, which may lead to anxiety, decreased self-esteem, and demotivation, particularly for individuals who consistently rank lower [[1,22]]. This aligns with findings that learners may actively reject competitive elements if they feel they cannot win or if the competition feels unfair [[21]]. The "overjustification effect" is a particular concern, where the introduction of extrinsic rewards (like points) can undermine an individual's pre-existing intrinsic motivation for a task [[20]]. If learners begin to see the educational activity as a means to get points rather than as a valuable learning experience, the intervention may achieve compliance but fail to foster genuine interest or long-term engagement. Moreover, the collection of user data for tracking progress and personalization raises serious privacy concerns, especially in healthcare settings where sensitive information is involved [[22]]. There is a risk of cognitive manipulation, where persuasive technologies are used to create dependencies or addictive behaviors, as seen with some fitness apps [[22]]. These issues necessitate a thoughtful approach to design that prioritizes user autonomy, transparency, and well-being, moving beyond a singular focus on engagement metrics.

Finally, significant gaps remain in the scope and focus of the research itself. There is a notable underrepresentation of certain health professions, with medicine and nursing dominating the literature [[13]]. Pharmacy, dentistry, and other allied health fields are less studied, limiting the generalizability of findings. There is also a lack of research on interprofessional education, despite the clear need for healthcare professionals to collaborate effectively. Additionally, most studies are conducted in high-income countries, creating a blind spot regarding the applicability of these interventions in low-resource settings or culturally diverse contexts [[13]]. The underrepresentation of gamification in professional development for practicing nurses is another critical gap identified in the literature [[8]]. Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort from researchers to adopt more rigorous methodologies, integrate stronger theoretical foundations, conduct thorough ethical analyses, and expand the scope of their investigations to cover a wider range of health professions and global contexts.

## Future Research Directions

To overcome the current challenges and realize the full potential of gamification in health professions education, future research must pursue several key directions aimed at enhancing methodological rigor, deepening theoretical grounding, and expanding the scope of inquiry. The foremost priority is the adoption of more robust and sophisticated research designs. There is an urgent need for well-powered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with long-term follow-up to establish causal relationships and assess sustained effects [[10,17]]. Such studies should move beyond simple measures of knowledge gain to evaluate more complex outcomes, including clinical reasoning, decision-making, and actual performance in simulated or real-world settings. Longitudinal designs are essential for understanding how the effects of gamification evolve over time and whether initial gains in motivation translate into lasting behavioral change [[3]]. Furthermore, future research should embrace mixed-methods approaches that combine quantitative data with qualitative insights from learners and educators to better understand the lived experience of gamified learning and the contextual factors that influence its success or failure [[13]].

Secondly, the field must commit to a stronger and more explicit theoretical foundation. Researchers should move beyond merely mentioning theories in passing and instead use them as a guiding principle for every stage of the design-build-test cycle. This includes applying cognitive theories such as Dual-Process Theory, Cognitive Load Theory, and the expertise reversal effect to ensure that game mechanics support, rather than hinder, cognitive processing [[13,17]]. Integrating motivational theories like SDT and the Octalysis Framework can help designers create interventions that cater to a broader range of learner motivations and avoid unintended negative consequences like the overjustification effect or excessive social comparison [[12,20]]. Future work should also investigate the synergistic effects of combining different theoretical models—for example, pairing a constructivist learning framework with an intrinsic motivation theory—to create more holistic and effective designs [[13]].

Thirdly, research must broaden its focus to address the identified gaps in content and context. There is a critical need for studies in underrepresented health professions, including pharmacy, dentistry, and physical therapy, to determine if the findings from medicine and nursing are generalizable [[13]]. Equally important is the development of gamified interventions for interprofessional education, which is vital for preparing teams of healthcare providers to work collaboratively. Research should also expand into low- and middle-income countries to explore the adaptation of gamification for different cultural contexts and resource constraints [[13]]. The underdeveloped area of continuing professional development for practicing nurses also warrants dedicated investigation [[8]].

Finally, the burgeoning fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and immersive technologies present exciting opportunities for future research. AI-enhanced adaptive gamification could personalize the learning experience in real-time, adjusting the difficulty and type of challenges based on a learner's performance and style [[13]]. This could mitigate the expertise reversal effect by providing more scaffolding for novices and more challenging material for experts. The integration of advanced virtual and augmented reality offers the potential for hyper-realistic simulations that allow for safe, repeated practice of high-stakes clinical skills [[13]]. Future studies should explore how these technologies can be leveraged to create more engaging, effective, and accessible educational experiences. To conclude, the path forward for gamification in health professions education lies in a deliberate shift from novelty-driven experimentation to evidence-based, theory-informed, and ethically-conscious design. By pursuing these research directions, the field can transition from a promising trend to a mature and reliable pedagogical tool capable of meeting the complex demands of modern healthcare education.

## Conclusion

In summary, this systematic review has synthesized the current state of research on gamification in health professions education, revealing a field characterized by immense potential tempered by significant challenges. The evidence indicates that well-designed gamified interventions can be highly effective, with numerous studies demonstrating improvements in learner motivation, satisfaction, knowledge retention, and even clinical self-efficacy [[9,14,19]]. Successful implementations often feature a combination of game elements centered on assessment and challenge, delivered through engaging digital platforms or immersive experiences [[3,13]]. Theoretical frameworks, particularly Self-Determination Theory and the Octalysis Framework, provide valuable lenses for designing interventions that align with core human needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness [[12,20]].

However, the field is hampered by a series of critical weaknesses. The overall quality of the research literature suffers from methodological flaws, including small sample sizes, a lack of robust control groups, and an overreliance on immediate post-intervention knowledge tests [[7,17]]. Perhaps most importantly, there is a pervasive underutilization of theoretical frameworks to guide the design and interpretation of these interventions, leaving practitioners to rely on ad-hoc experimentation rather than principled innovation [[3]]. Furthermore, significant ethical challenges exist, particularly concerning the potential for social comparison to cause anxiety, the risk of undermining intrinsic motivation, and the handling of sensitive user data [[20,22]].

To advance from its current state, the field must prioritize future research that addresses these gaps. The call is for more rigorous, longitudinal RCTs grounded in sound theoretical models that go beyond surface-level engagement to foster deep cognitive processing and intrinsic motivation [[3,13]]. Future studies must also broaden their scope to include a wider range of health professions, explore interprofessional education, and consider the unique needs of learners in diverse global and clinical contexts [[13]]. Ultimately, the successful integration of gamification into health professions education hinges on a deliberate shift towards a more scientific, ethical, and deeply human-centered approach. When executed with care and intention, gamification holds the promise of transforming learning into a more engaging, effective, and empowering experience for the next generation of healthcare professionals.
