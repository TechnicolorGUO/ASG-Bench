## Introduction and Background

The design of upper limb exoskeletons represents a critical frontier in robotics, with profound implications for medicine, industry, and human augmentation. These wearable robotic devices are engineered to interface with the human body, providing support, assistance, or enhancement to the movements of the arm, hand, and fingers. Their development is driven by two primary motivations: the urgent need to address the global burden of disability from conditions like stroke and neuromuscular disease, and the persistent demand for technologies that can enhance worker productivity and safety in physically demanding industrial environments. Stroke alone presents a significant public health challenge, with millions of new cases annually and a high probability of resulting in long-term motor disability [[10]]. This has catalyzed extensive research into rehabilitation robots designed to restore function through repetitive, task-oriented training. Concurrently, the rise of Industry 4.0 and the increasing emphasis on ergonomics have fueled the development of exoskeletons intended to mitigate fatigue and prevent musculoskeletal injuries associated with manual labor [[5,6]].

Despite decades of innovation, the field faces a fundamental paradox. While early prototypes focused on replicating human strength, modern designs grapple with the nuanced challenges of human-robot interaction (HRI). The very technology designed to assist the user can, under certain conditions, lead to negative physiological outcomes. Studies have shown that prolonged use of passive exoskeletons, which are designed to counteract gravity, can paradoxically lead to muscle overload in some postural muscles while reducing activity in others [[6]]. This highlights a critical insight: the effectiveness of an exoskeleton is not merely a function of its mechanical power but is deeply intertwined with its ability to harmonize with the complex biomechanics of the human body. The ultimate goal is to create a device that functions as an intuitive extension of the user's own limb, seamlessly blending human intent with robotic action.

This review aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the current state of upper limb exoskeleton design. It synthesizes findings from recent literature to explore the key components, control methodologies, applications, and inherent challenges of these systems. By examining the trade-offs between different design philosophies—from rigid, powered structures to soft, compliant garments—this report seeks to illuminate the path forward for creating more effective, safe, and user-centric technologies. The analysis focuses specifically on the hardware and control aspects of design, drawing exclusively on the provided source materials to present a rigorous overview of the field's strengths, weaknesses, and future potential. The objective is to move beyond a simple cataloging of devices and towards a deeper understanding of the underlying principles and open questions that define this dynamic area of research.

## Key Concepts and Foundational Principles

A robust understanding of upper limb exoskeleton design requires a firm grasp of foundational anatomical concepts, core mechanical principles, and established classification frameworks. The human upper limb is a marvel of biological engineering, characterized by a high degree of degrees of freedom (DoF) and complex kinematics, particularly at the shoulder joint. The shoulder itself is not a single joint but a functional system comprising four articulations: the glenohumeral (GH), acromioclavicular (AC), sternoclavicular (ST), and scapulothoracic joints [[9,12]]. The GH joint, modeled as a ball-and-socket, accounts for approximately two-thirds of the shoulder's total range of motion (ROM) [[12]]. However, accurately replicating the full dynamics of this system poses a significant challenge for designers. Many exoskeletons simplify the shoulder to a three-DoF ball socket joint, effectively ignoring the crucial translation and rotation of the scapula and clavicle, which can lead to misalignment between the robot and the wearer's anatomy [[9,12]]. More sophisticated models incorporate additional DoFs to account for ST joint motion, such as the five-DoF mechanism in the MEDARM exoskeleton, but even these often fail to capture the full complexity, leading to discomfort and unwanted reaction forces [[12]]. This kinematic incompatibility is a primary cause of user discomfort and poor performance, underscoring the need for designs that can accommodate anatomical variability and movement-induced shifts in joint axes [[5,9,12]].

From a mechanical standpoint, the design of an exoskeleton is constrained by several key factors. Weight is a paramount concern, as excessive mass can increase metabolic cost and impede natural movement. Consequently, there is a strong trend toward using lightweight materials like carbon fiber, aluminum alloys (e.g., 7075), and advanced plastics produced via 3D printing [[2,4,5]]. The distribution of mass is also critical; off-body motor placement, where actuators are mounted on the torso or back, is a strategy used to reduce the weight directly attached to the limbs, thereby improving safety and comfort [[1]]. Another central concept is the distinction between rigid and soft actuation. Rigid exoskeletons rely on hard links and joints connected by electric motors, hydraulic cylinders, or pneumatic actuators, offering high precision and payload capacity [[4,9]]. In contrast, soft exoskeletons utilize flexible materials, fabric structures, and pneumatic or textile-based actuators to provide assistance through distributed compliance, aiming for greater comfort and adaptability to the human form [[4,13]]. Cable-driven systems represent a hybrid approach, using tendons to transmit force from compact motors, often allowing for lighter distal linkages [[4,8]].

To systematically categorize the vast array of exoskeletons, researchers have developed classification frameworks. One prominent structure divides control algorithms into three levels: high-level training modalities (e.g., passive, active-assistive, resistive), low-level control strategies (e.g., impedance, admittance, position control), and hardware-level implementation (e.g., actuation type, sensing technology) [[8]]. This framework helps dissect how a user's high-level intention is translated into specific robotic actions. For instance, a patient might select a "resistive" training mode, the controller might implement this via an admittance model, and the hardware would be realized with electric motors and force sensors [[8]]. Another common classification is based on the number of DoFs, which dictates the system's dexterity. Designs range from simple two-DoF elbow-wrist orthoses to highly complex seven-DoF shoulder-elbow-arm systems that aim to cover the full natural ROM [[3,4]]. The NuExo, for example, achieves 100% coverage of natural upper limb ROM with just four motors through a biomimetic shoulder design [[2]]. Finally, applications serve as another powerful lens for classification, broadly separating devices into rehabilitation (for stroke, spinal cord injury, etc.), industrial assistance (for manufacturing, construction), and augmentation for healthy individuals [[4,9]]. Each application domain imposes unique design constraints, from the need for sterile, hygienic materials in rehabilitation to the requirement for durability and high payload capacity in industrial settings.

## Historical Development and Modern Milestones

The history of upper limb exoskeletons is a chronicle of technological ambition and incremental progress, tracing a path from speculative science fiction to practical engineering solutions. The conceptual origins of the powered exoskeleton can be found in the 1960s with General Electric's Hardiman project [[9]]. This ambitious master-slave system was conceived for military purposes, utilizing hydraulic actuators to grant a single operator superhuman strength. Although it never became fully operational due to immense technical challenges, including its prohibitive weight and control difficulties, Hardiman laid the foundational vision for wearable robotics [[9]]. Decades later, this vision began to take tangible shape with the advent of more advanced electronics and sensor technology. A pivotal milestone was the development of the Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) by Professor Yoshiyuki Sankai and his team at the University of Tsukuba [[9]]. HAL introduced a revolutionary control paradigm based on detecting and interpreting the faint electrical signals generated by the user's muscles, known as electromyography (EMG) [[5]]. This allowed for a more intuitive, patient-cooperative form of control, where the robot moves in direct response to the user's neural intent. HAL's success in both rehabilitation and industrial contexts helped legitimize the field and spurred widespread academic and commercial interest [[9]].

In parallel with the development of powered systems, significant advancements were made in simpler, passive assistive devices. These systems, which do not require external power, typically use springs, counterweights, or elastic elements to offset the effects of gravity on the limbs. The Skelex 360 is a notable example, designed primarily for industrial use to reduce the muscular effort required during overhead tasks [[6]]. Its historical importance lies in pioneering the concept of physical compensation for gravity, a principle that remains central to many modern passive exoskeletons. While less technologically complex than their powered counterparts, passive systems are crucial for applications where simplicity, reliability, and lack of batteries are paramount advantages.

The modern era of upper limb exoskeleton design is characterized by rapid diversification and specialization, driven by breakthroughs in materials science, miniaturization of electronics, and the integration of artificial intelligence. A key trend has been the shift from rigid, bulky structures to more lightweight and adaptable forms. The emergence of soft robotics has been a particularly transformative development, with research trends showing a strong focus on compliant mechanisms for better human adaptation [[5,13]]. This evolution is reflected in the proliferation of novel designs tailored for specific needs. For instance, the u-Rob exoskeleton features an innovative ergonomic shoulder module with movable instantaneous centers of rotation to better match natural human motion [[3]], while the NuExo integrates a biomimetic shoulder mechanism to achieve full ROM with a minimal number of motors [[2]]. The table below summarizes a selection of representative modern upper limb exoskeletons, illustrating the diversity in design philosophy, actuation, and application.

| **CRUX** | High | Soft Robotics / Tensegrity Structures | Experimental design for human-robot interaction. | `[[9]]` |

This period of intense innovation has resulted in a rich ecosystem of devices, each pushing the boundaries of what is possible in terms of functionality, usability, and integration with human physiology. The journey from the hydraulic bulk of Hardiman to the sleek, AI-driven systems of today demonstrates a clear trajectory toward more intelligent, personalized, and collaborative robotic partners.

## Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

The current landscape of upper limb exoskeleton design is defined by a sophisticated interplay of advanced materials, diverse actuation technologies, and increasingly intelligent control systems. At the hardware level, the choice of material is a critical design decision balancing strength, weight, and cost. Carbon fiber composites are frequently employed for their high strength-to-weight ratio, as seen in the NuExo exoskeleton [[2]]. Aluminum alloys, particularly the high-strength 7075 grade, are used for structural components requiring durability [[4]]. Concurrently, additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, has become a cornerstone of modern prototyping and production. Materials such as polylactic acid (PLA) and photosensitive resins are widely used to create custom-fit parts that reduce overall weight and improve portability, as demonstrated in the u-Rob and other designs [[1,2,4]]. This allows for rapid iteration and the creation of complex geometries that would be difficult or expensive to produce with traditional methods.

Actuation technology is perhaps the most varied aspect of exoskeleton design, with no single solution emerging as universally superior. Electric motors, particularly brushless DC (BLDC) motors, are the most common choice due to their controllability, efficiency, and wide availability [[4,9]]. Models like the Maxon EC series and CubeMars AK80 series are cited in numerous recent studies for their power density and reliability [[3,4]]. To manage the high torques generated by these motors at the joints, harmonic drives are frequently used as gear reducers, providing a high reduction ratio in a compact package [[3,4]]. Pneumatic and hydraulic actuation offer lower intrinsic impedance and can be lighter, making them suitable for soft or heavy-duty systems, though they introduce challenges related to air compression and fluid management [[4,9]]. A third major category is cable-driven systems, which decouple the motor from the joint, allowing for a lighter distal segment. This approach is used in designs like CAREX-7 and ALEx to reduce inertia and improve wearability [[4,8]]. Emerging technologies include Series Elastic Actuators (SEAs), which incorporate a spring element to provide intrinsic compliance, improve force sensing accuracy, and protect against impacts. SEAs are featured in the Harmony and NEUROExos rehabilitation systems [[8,9]]. Even Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuators have been explored for low-power, small-scale applications, albeit with limitations in speed and force output [[4]].

The control architecture is the brain of the exoskeleton, translating the user's intent into coordinated motion. The most prevalent method is PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control, a well-understood and computationally efficient technique for tracking desired trajectories [[1,3]]. However, more advanced strategies are becoming standard. Impedance control, which regulates the relationship between force and motion, is widely used to make the robot feel compliant and safe during interaction [[8]]. Cartesian-space impedance control uses the Jacobian matrix to map joint-level torques to end-effector forces, enabling intuitive control in the workspace [[8]]. Admittance control is its inverse, where the system's motion follows an applied force, making it ideal for interactive tasks [[8]]. To bridge the gap between user and machine, various sensors are integrated. Proprioceptive sensors like Hall effect encoders and IMUs track joint angles and orientation [[3,4]]. For external sensing, cameras and RGB-D sensors can be used for gesture recognition or environmental mapping [[2]]. Force and torque sensing is critical for safe interaction. This is achieved using six-axis force-torque (F/T) sensors at the interfaces, load cells, or indirect measurement via strain gauges in SEAs [[3,8]].

Perhaps the most significant advancement in control is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Deep learning models, such as CNN-BiLSTM networks combined with attention mechanisms, are being used to classify complex upper limb motion states (e.g., resting, rapid movement) from sEMG signals with over 97% accuracy [[7]]. This enables a much richer understanding of user intent than simple on/off EMG detection. Reinforcement learning is being explored to optimize control policies in real-time, adapting to individual users and changing tasks [[14]]. Furthermore, AI is being leveraged to personalize therapy, with neuro-fuzzy systems adjusting impedance parameters based on user performance and FMG-based models detecting intent from muscle signals [[9]]. These techniques promise to transform exoskeletons from reactive devices into proactive partners that anticipate user needs, dynamically adapt their behavior, and deliver highly personalized assistance.

## Applications and Clinical Efficacy

Upper limb exoskeletons are being deployed across a wide spectrum of applications, from intensive clinical rehabilitation to daily industrial assistance. The largest and most mature application domain is post-stroke rehabilitation. Here, the primary goals are to restore motor function, improve range of motion (ROM), and enhance independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) [[10,15]]. Devices like the WREX, HEXO-UR30A, and HAL have been used in clinical settings to provide gravity compensation, facilitate repetitive reaching tasks, and guide patients through therapeutic exercises [[15]]. The rationale is that structured, high-repetition practice can promote neuroplasticity and functional recovery. Systems such as the ARMin, ALEx, and Harmony are designed for this purpose, often incorporating compliant actuators like SEAs to ensure safety during interaction with fragile patients [[8,9]]. Commercial products like the MyoPro Orthosis and HandTutor further expand the market for assistive devices targeting specific impairments [[9]].

In industrial settings, the primary motivation is to reduce physical strain and prevent work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). Exoskeletons like the EksoVest and Skelex 360 are designed to offload the weight of the arms during overhead tasks, thereby reducing the activation of fatiguing postural muscles like the upper trapezius [[6,9]]. This can lead to improved worker endurance, reduced risk of injury, and potentially increased productivity. Beyond general assistance, specialized exoskeletons are being developed for specific industries. For example, the Yu et al. (2018) design was created for refractory construction workers, capable of handling loads up to 50 kg, while the Talley et al. (2025) exoskeleton provides mirror control for pick-and-place operations, reducing muscle activity by 40% [[4]]. These applications highlight the potential for exoskeletons to augment human capabilities in physically demanding jobs.

However, a critical question that persists is whether these devices actually work, and if so, under what conditions. The scientific evidence regarding efficacy is mixed and often points to a disconnect between laboratory results and real-world utility. A landmark meta-analysis of 54 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concluded that while upper limb robotic rehabilitation has a statistically significant positive effect on motor capacity compared to conventional therapy, the magnitude of this effect is small and may not be clinically meaningful [[17]]. The benefits observed in the lab did not consistently translate to improvements in ADLs or maintain gains at follow-up, suggesting that simply using a robot is not enough to guarantee recovery [[17]]. Interestingly, the subgroup analysis revealed that certain device characteristics were associated with better outcomes: partial assistance, targeting of distal joints, unilateral application, fewer DoFs, and the use of a single device were all correlated with higher effect sizes [[17]]. This suggests that simpler, more targeted interventions may be more effective than complex, multi-function machines.

Further complicating the picture is the issue of adverse effects. Field studies have shown that the benefits of exoskeletons are not always straightforward. For instance, passive anti-gravity exoskeletons have been shown to reduce EMG activity in some muscles by up to 38.7% during lifting simulations but can paradoxically lead to muscle overload in others, such as the posterior deltoid and latissimus dorsi [[6]]. Other negative consequences reported in the literature include increased cognitive load, localized discomfort at the joints, postural instability, and even trip hazards [[6]]. These findings underscore a critical weakness in the current generation of devices: they are often evaluated based on isolated metrics like ROM improvement without considering their holistic impact on the user. The context of use is paramount; one study noted that while an exoskeleton might reduce perceived exertion, it could simultaneously increase the time required to complete a task, negating any productivity gains [[6]]. This highlights a major challenge: moving beyond simplistic efficacy claims to a more nuanced understanding of how these devices perform within the complex environment of a patient's life or a factory floor.

## Critical Analysis of Challenges and Open Problems

Despite remarkable technological progress, the widespread adoption of upper limb exoskeletons is hindered by a confluence of technical, usability, economic, and social challenges. A critical analysis reveals that the field is currently grappling with a fundamental tension between technological ambition and practical usability. The most pervasive technical challenge is the problem of kinematic incompatibility, stemming from the mismatch between the simplified mechanical joints of an exoskeleton and the complex, translating articulations of the human body [[5,12]]. This misalignment can generate uncomfortable contact forces, lead to slippage, and even cause long-term musculoskeletal issues by altering muscle activation patterns [[9,12]]. The phenomenon of unintended rotations at the shoulder, for example, has been shown to significantly alter the force distribution in rotator cuff muscles, posing a potential injury risk [[12]]. Addressing this requires either more complex and heavier mechanical compensatory mechanisms or the development of inherently compliant, soft systems that can adapt to individual anatomy.

Usability remains a formidable barrier. Donning and doffing (putting on and taking off) an exoskeleton can be a cumbersome process, often requiring assistance from a clinician or caregiver, which limits independent use [[5,9]]. Comfort is another major concern; improper load distribution, friction at contact points, and pressure sores can make extended use intolerable [[5,6]]. Furthermore, the cognitive load imposed on the user is often underestimated. Controlling a multi-DoF device requires significant mental effort, especially when dealing with noisy sensors or delayed responses, which can detract from the primary task and increase the risk of accidents [[6]]. The training requirements for both clinicians and patients are substantial, yet inadequate training is a common factor in poor outcomes and user abandonment [[6]].

Economic and social hurdles are equally significant. The high manufacturing costs of advanced components, coupled with a lack of standardized reimbursement pathways from insurance companies, place these devices out of reach for many individuals who could benefit from them [[5]]. The limited battery life of powered systems further constrains mobility and usability, particularly outside of a controlled clinical or industrial setting [[5]]. Perhaps the most subtle but potent barrier is user acceptance. Bulky, unattractive designs can lead to stigmatization and a reluctance to use the device in public [[5]]. Safety concerns, real or perceived, and the sheer novelty of the technology can also foster resistance. Gender differences in comfort perception have been identified, with women reporting higher rejection rates, highlighting the need for anthropometrically inclusive design [[6]].

Finally, the evaluation of these systems suffers from a lack of rigorous, standardized methodology. Many studies suffer from small sample sizes, moderate risk of bias, and a reliance on short-term outcome measures that may not capture long-term benefits or harms [[6,15]]. There is a critical need for large-scale, multicenter RCTs to establish definitive evidence for efficacy [[15]]. Moreover, the field lacks consensus on standardized protocols for field validation, making it difficult to compare performance across different devices and environments [[6]]. The absence of longitudinal data means we know little about the long-term effects of wearing an exoskeleton, both positive and negative. Without addressing these interconnected challenges—from the fundamental mechanics of human-robot interaction to the socio-economic realities of deployment—the full potential of upper limb exoskeletons will remain unrealized.

## Future Research Directions and Concluding Remarks

Looking ahead, the future of upper limb exoskeleton design is poised for transformation, driven by a convergence of emerging technologies and a deeper understanding of human-centered design principles. The most promising direction is the continued integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to create truly adaptive and personalized systems. Instead of relying on pre-programmed trajectories or static assistance levels, future exoskeletons will likely employ AI to continuously learn from the user, adapting their behavior to individual biomechanics, fatigue levels, and evolving therapeutic needs [[9,14]]. Generative models, for instance, could create customized training regimens, while deep learning classifiers can provide near-instantaneous and accurate interpretation of complex user intent from neural signals like sEMG or EEG [[7,14]]. This shift towards personalization is essential for overcoming the one-size-fits-all limitations of current devices and maximizing therapeutic efficacy.

Another key trend is the maturation of soft robotics and compliant systems. As fabrication techniques for smart materials and textiles advance, we can expect to see more lightweight, comfortable, and inherently safe exosuits and soft orthoses [[5,13]]. These systems will likely leverage distributed actuation and sensing to provide assistance that is more closely aligned with the body's natural mechanics, mitigating the risks of kinematic incompatibility. The development of novel materials, such as recycled plastics and bio-integrated electronics, will also play a role in making these devices more sustainable and accessible [[5]]. Modular designs will become more prevalent, allowing users to configure a base system for different applications, such as swapping a gripper for a lifting aid, thereby increasing versatility and value [[5,9]].

To summarize, this review has traced the evolution of upper limb exoskeleton design from its conceptual origins to the sophisticated, multifaceted systems of today. We have seen how the field navigates the intricate balance between mimicking complex human anatomy and leveraging advanced materials and control strategies. The analysis reveals a field at a critical juncture: while the technology has advanced dramatically, its real-world impact is tempered by persistent challenges in usability, safety, and economic viability. The greatest strength of modern exoskeletons lies in their increasing intelligence and personalization capabilities, yet this same sophistication introduces new complexities in control and evaluation.

In conclusion, the path forward requires a concerted effort to resolve the core conflicts that currently limit adoption. Future research must prioritize user-centered co-design, ensuring that technological innovations are validated in real-world contexts and meet the genuine needs of end-users [[5]]. There is a pressing need for standardized, longitudinal studies to build a robust evidence base for efficacy and safety. The next generation of upper limb exoskeletons will not be defined by brute-force power or a high DoF count alone, but by their ability to integrate seamlessly into human lives—offering assistance that is intelligent, adaptive, comfortable, and ultimately, empowering.
