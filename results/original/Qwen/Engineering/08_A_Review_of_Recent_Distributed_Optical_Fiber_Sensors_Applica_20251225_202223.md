## Introduction and Research Motivation

The integrity, safety, and longevity of civil engineering infrastructure are paramount to societal function and economic stability. Traditional methods for monitoring these structures have relied on discrete, point-based sensors that provide a limited, non-continuous view of structural health. While effective for targeted assessments, this approach is often labor-intensive, costly at scale, and fails to capture the complex, distributed nature of strain fields, temperature gradients, and damage propagation within large-scale assets like bridges, dams, tunnels, and pipelines. The limitations of these conventional techniques have spurred the development of more advanced sensing paradigms capable of providing comprehensive, spatially continuous data over vast distances. Among these, Distributed Optical Fiber Sensing (DOFS) has emerged as a transformative technology, offering a paradigm shift in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). DOFS leverages the fundamental properties of optical fibers—long, continuous lengths of glass or plastic—to transform a single cable into a dense network of thousands of sensors functioning simultaneously as 'strain gauges', 'thermocouples', and even 'accelerometers' [[5,14]]. This capability allows for the creation of what has been termed a 'civil infrastructure nerve system', enabling real-time, high-sensitivity monitoring over kilometer-scale distances [[5]].

The motivation for this review stems from the rapid maturation of DOFS technologies and their increasing adoption in critical civil engineering applications. The unique advantages of optical fiber sensors, including their small size, lightweight design, immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI), resistance to harsh environmental conditions such as high temperatures and pressure, and inherent electrical passiveness, make them exceptionally well-suited for SHM [[4,8]]. These attributes address many of the shortcomings of traditional electronic sensors, which can be susceptible to corrosion, signal degradation over long distances, and EMI in electrified environments like railways or near substations. Furthermore, the ability of DOFS to provide truly distributed measurements allows engineers to identify subtle phenomena like micro-crack initiation, localized stress concentrations, and progressive debonding that would otherwise remain undetected by sparse sensor arrays. This enhanced understanding of a structure's behavior is crucial for improving predictive models, optimizing maintenance schedules, and preventing catastrophic failures.

This paper presents a systematic literature review designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in DOFS for civil engineering SHM. Its primary objective is to synthesize recent research findings, analyze key technological advancements, and critically evaluate the practical challenges and future potential of these systems. By examining the historical context, dissecting the underlying physics of different sensing modalities, and presenting a detailed survey of case studies, this review aims to equip researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of how DOFS is being applied today. It will explore the trade-offs between competing technologies, highlight successful deployments in various civil structures, and identify the critical open problems that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of distributed fiber optic sensing. Ultimately, this work seeks to contribute to the ongoing evolution of smart infrastructure by providing a clear-eyed assessment of where the field stands and what it will take to transition from laboratory proof-of-concepts to widespread, reliable, and autonomous SHM solutions for the world's most vital infrastructure assets.

## Key Concepts and Fundamental Principles

Distributed Optical Fiber Sensing (DOFS) represents a significant departure from conventional point-based sensing by utilizing an entire length of optical fiber as a continuous measurement device [[5]]. The core principle behind all DOFS technologies is the analysis of light that is backscattered along the fiber when a short, intense pulse of light is launched from one end. Three distinct scattering mechanisms form the basis for different types of DOFS: Rayleigh, Brillouin, and Raman scattering. Each mechanism provides unique capabilities and is sensitive to different physical parameters, leading to a diverse toolkit of sensors tailored for specific SHM applications [[4,6,7]].

Rayleigh scattering is the most fundamental and ubiquitous form of scattering in optical fibers, arising from microscopic variations in the fiber's refractive index. It occurs at the same wavelength as the incident light and is used in technologies such as Optical Time-Domain Reflectometry (OTDR) and Optical Frequency-Domain Reflectometry (OFDR) [[6,10]]. The extreme sensitivity of Rayleigh scattering, which is approximately three orders of magnitude higher than that of Brillouin-based methods, makes it ideal for high-resolution applications [[3]]. OFDR systems achieve very high spatial resolutions, sometimes down to the millimeter scale, by analyzing the interference pattern resulting from the beat between the scattered light and a reference beam [[6,7]]. This enables exceptional detail in detecting small-scale features, such as micro-cracks in concrete with widths less than 0.5 mm [[7]] or crack openings as small as 23 μm using AI-based analysis [[12]]. However, the utility of Rayleigh-based systems is typically constrained to shorter sensing ranges, often less than 100 meters, though some advanced systems report ranges up to 2 kilometers [[6,7]]. OTDR operates on a similar principle but uses time-domain analysis, offering coarser spatial resolution (on the order of centimeters) but potentially longer range [[6,9]].

Brillouin scattering is a more complex phenomenon involving the interaction of the optical pulse with acoustic phonons (sound waves) in the fiber material, resulting in scattered light at a slightly different frequency (the Brillouin frequency shift). This frequency shift is highly sensitive to both strain and temperature changes within the fiber, making Brillouin Optical Time-Domain Reflectometry (BOTDR) and its more precise variant, Brillouin Optical Time-Domain Analysis (BOTDA), powerful tools for distributed strain and temperature sensing [[7,11]]. Brillouin-based systems excel at long-range monitoring, with commercial systems reporting sensing ranges of up to 51 km [[7]], and some experimental reports reaching over 100 km [[15]]. They are widely deployed for monitoring large civil structures like dams, tunnels, and long-span bridges [[6,7]]. The spatial resolution is generally lower than Rayleigh-based systems, typically around 1 meter, though advanced techniques can push this below 10 cm [[3,7]]. A key challenge with Brillouin sensing is the strong cross-sensitivity between strain and temperature; separating these two effects requires either multi-technology approaches or sophisticated signal processing, and achieving high precision over long distances remains a significant technical hurdle [[3,7]].

Raman scattering arises from the inelastic interaction of photons with molecular vibrations in the fiber, also resulting in scattered light at different frequencies. The intensity ratio of the scattered light at Stokes and anti-Stokes frequencies is a direct measure of the local temperature, making Raman Optical Time-Domain Reflectometry (ROTDR) the standard for Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) [[6,7]]. Raman-based systems are primarily used for temperature monitoring, with typical sensing ranges of 15-25 km depending on the desired resolution [[4]]. While they do not measure strain directly, temperature data is often a critical input for correcting other sensor measurements or for applications like dike leakage detection, where thermal signatures indicate seepage [[7]]. The performance of Raman sensors is heavily dependent on detector technology, with modern InGaAs avalanche photodiodes (APDs) enabling greater sensing ranges compared to older systems [[15]]. The choice among these scattering mechanisms dictates the type of information that can be gathered, forcing engineers to select the appropriate technology based on the specific requirements of their SHM application, balancing the need for high resolution against the need for long-range coverage.

## Historical Development and Technological Milestones

The journey of optical fiber sensors from theoretical concepts to mature technologies for civil engineering SHM is marked by pivotal scientific discoveries and sustained industrial innovation. The foundation of modern fiber optics was laid in the late 19th century with early experiments on light guiding through water jets by Philip Releaux in 1880 [[10]]. However, it was the pioneering work in the 1960s and 1970s that truly set the stage for the revolution in sensing. The development of low-loss optical fibers by researchers at Corning Glass Works in the early 1970s was a critical breakthrough, enabling the long-distance transmission of light signals essential for any practical sensing application [[10]]. Concurrently, the invention of the helium-neon laser provided a stable, coherent light source required for interferometric measurements. The seminal discovery by K.O. Hill and his colleagues in 1978 that photosensitivity could be induced in optical fibers opened the door to creating permanent, embedded gratings within the fiber core—a technology that would become the cornerstone of Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors [[4]].

While FBGs were being developed for point sensing, the principles of distributed sensing began to take shape with the advent of Optical Time-Domain Reflectometry (OTDR). First demonstrated in the 1970s, OTDR was initially used to characterize fiber links by measuring the amount of light scattered back from along the fiber's length [[10]]. This technique proved the concept that a continuous fiber could be interrogated to obtain spatially resolved information. The subsequent development of Optical Frequency-Domain Reflectometry (OFDR) offered a complementary approach, using swept-wavelength interferometry to achieve much higher spatial resolutions than OTDR [[10]]. The exploration of Brillouin and Raman scattering for distributed sensing followed, with early theoretical work and demonstrations showing the potential to use these inelastic scattering processes to measure strain and temperature along a fiber [[6,7]]. Luc Thévenaz's work in the 1990s on stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) further expanded the possibilities, demonstrating the potential for amplification of weak probe signals, a key enabler for ultra-long-range sensing [[11,15]].

A major inflection point in the adoption of DOFS for civil engineering came with the development of more robust and user-friendly interrogation systems. Companies like Luna Technologies (with their ODiSI series) and fibrisTerre Systems GmbH (with their fTB 5020 series) played a crucial role in commercializing these technologies, making them accessible to a wider community of researchers and engineers [[1,13]]. The establishment of specialized consortia, such as the Photonic Sensing Consortium (PhoSC) in Japan, further accelerated progress by fostering collaboration between construction companies and fiber optic specialists [[3]]. The PhoSC's publication of a comprehensive DFOS manual for civil engineering in 2021 is a testament to the technology's growing maturity and standardized application protocols [[3]]. The number of research papers on the topic published by the Japanese Civil Engineering Association has seen a dramatic increase over the last decade, signaling a global trend toward broader acceptance and integration [[3]].

Key milestones include the first long-term deployments of DOFS in critical infrastructure. For instance, the Luís I Bridge in Portugal has been monitored since 2004 using FBG sensors, while the Ria de Aveiro canal has utilized them for water temperature monitoring since 2002 [[4]]. In the realm of distributed sensing, the long-term monitoring of the Götaälv Bridge in Sweden since 2007–2009 using BOTDA represents one of the earliest and most ambitious applications, setting a precedent for the durability and reliability of these systems in real-world conditions [[6,7]]. More recent deployments showcase the expanding scale and sophistication of DOFS applications. The Semmering Base Tunnel in Austria employed OFDR on shotcrete linings during its New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM) construction, providing unprecedented detail on the deformation process [[12]]. Similarly, the Trans-Andean Pipeline in Peru utilizes BOTDA over a staggering 408 km stretch to monitor for landslide-induced deformations, highlighting the technology's capability for national-scale infrastructure security [[12]]. These landmark projects, alongside countless others documented in the literature, demonstrate that DOFS has evolved from a promising laboratory curiosity into a proven and indispensable tool for modern civil engineering SHM.

## Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

The current landscape of Distributed Optical Fiber Sensing (DOFS) for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is characterized by a suite of distinct technologies, each with a unique profile of strengths and weaknesses. The selection of an appropriate method hinges on a careful balance of several key performance metrics, including spatial resolution, sensing range, measurement precision, and cost. As of the latest reviews, the primary contenders are systems based on Rayleigh, Brillouin, and Raman scattering, supplemented by phase-sensitive variants like φ-OTDR [[10,16]]. A comparative analysis reveals a clear trade-off space, where no single technology is universally superior; rather, each is best suited for a specific niche within the broad spectrum of SHM needs.

Rayleigh-based systems, particularly those employing Optical Frequency-Domain Reflectometry (OFDR), are distinguished by their unparalleled spatial resolution. Commercial systems can achieve resolutions down to the millimeter scale, with some research-grade instruments pushing this to as low as 0.63 mm [[7,12]]. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for applications requiring detailed characterization of fine-scale features, such as crack mapping in concrete, monitoring the integrity of adhesive bonds, or tracking the growth of micro-fractures [[6,7]]. However, this high resolution comes at the cost of a relatively short sensing range, typically under 100 meters, although some advanced systems report ranges up to 2 kilometers [[6,7]]. The table below summarizes the performance characteristics of these main technologies.

| Technology | Primary Scattering Mechanism | Spatial Resolution | Typical Sensing Range | Key Measurands | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OFDR** | Rayleigh | 0.63 mm – 1 mm [[6,12]] | < 100 m – 2 km [[7]] | Strain, Vibration | Highest spatial resolution; excellent for crack detection and dynamic events [[6,7]] | Shortest sensing range; sensitive to fiber length changes [[3]] |
| **PSP-BOTDR** | Brillouin | 10 cm [[3]] | Up to 10 km [[3]] | Strain, Temperature | Long-range capability; good strain precision (~6 με) [[3]] | Lower spatial resolution than Rayleigh; requires single-end access [[3]] |
| **BOTDA** | Brillouin | 0.2 m – 3 m [[17]] | >30 km (up to 100+ km theoretically) [[11,15]] | Strain, Temperature | Very long-range capability; highest precision for static measurements [[7]] | Most expensive; requires double-end access (limiting practicality); slower acquisition rates [[3,7]] |
| **φ-OTDR/DAS** | Rayleigh | 2 m – 10 m [[9]] | 1 km – 55 km [[9]] | Vibration, Acoustic Events | Extremely long-range vibration/strain sensing; scalable for perimeter security/seismic monitoring [[16]] | Lowest spatial resolution; difficult signal interpretation; highly sensitive to environmental noise [[16]] |
| **Raman-ROTDR** | Raman | 1 m – 1.5 m [[4]] | 15 km – 25 km [[4]] | Temperature only | Excellent for large-area temperature mapping (e.g., leak detection) [[7]] | Does not measure strain; temperature accuracy can be affected by fiber properties [[17]] |

Recent innovations have focused on enhancing the performance of these established techniques and exploring hybrid approaches. For example, the development of Pulse-Shift-Pulse BOTDR (PSP-BOTDR) offers a compelling compromise, achieving stable strain precision across long distances with single-end access, thereby overcoming a major limitation of traditional BOTDA [[3]]. Another significant advancement is the move towards hybrid systems that combine multiple sensing principles to overcome individual weaknesses. One such approach involves combining Rayleigh and Brillouin scattering to separate mechanical and thermal strain components, although the accuracy of this separation is currently limited by the precision of the Brillouin measurements [[3]]. Advanced signal processing techniques, such as coding schemes (e.g., pulse-position modulation) and coherent detection, have been instrumental in extending sensing ranges and improving signal-to-noise ratios, effectively pushing the boundaries of what is possible with existing hardware [[9,15]]. Looking forward, the future of DOFS lies in the convergence of these elements: the development of novel fiber designs, such as hollow-core antiresonant fibers that promise to reduce loss and enhance Brillouin gain [[15]], and the deep integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning for automated data interpretation, anomaly detection, and predictive modeling [[15,16]].

## Applications and Case Studies in Civil Infrastructure

The practical application of Distributed Optical Fiber Sensors (DOFS) has moved beyond the laboratory, with numerous case studies demonstrating their value across the full spectrum of civil engineering structures. From the foundations of skyscrapers to the linings of underground tunnels, DOFS technologies are providing unprecedented insights into structural behavior and performance. These applications can be broadly categorized into bridge and building monitoring, geotechnical and slope stability assessment, tunnel and underground space surveillance, pipeline integrity management, and dam safety monitoring.

In bridge engineering, DOFS have been instrumental in both new construction and long-term monitoring of aging infrastructure. The Principal Tower in London was instrumented with BOTDA to measure differential shortening between its columns and walls, providing critical data for validating structural models [[12]]. The Sarajevo Bridge in Barcelona utilized OFDR during a deck enlargement project to monitor strain and ensure the integrity of the retrofitting process [[12]]. Long-term monitoring of bridges like the Götaälv Bridge in Sweden (using BOTDA) and the Nine Wells Bridge in the UK (using BOTDR) has yielded valuable data on creep, shrinkage, and long-term deformation, contributing to improved understanding of material behavior over decades [[6,12]]. The Streicker Bridge at Princeton University serves as a prime example of embedding DOFS directly into the structure during construction, allowing for a complete record of its initial loading history [[6,7]].

Tunnel and underground space construction represent another key area of application. The New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM) construction of the Semmering Base Tunnel in Austria involved the use of OFDR to monitor strain on sprayed concrete linings in real-time, enabling engineers to visualize stress distribution and optimize the excavation sequence [[12]]. Similarly, the TMB L-9 metro tunnel in Barcelona was monitored with OFDR during the construction of an overlying building, providing essential data on ground movement and its impact on the tunnel lining [[12]]. Beyond new construction, DOFS are used for displacement monitoring in existing tunnels, such as the Nanjing Gulou and Xuanwuhu Lake tunnels in China, where BOTDR is used to track deformation over the entire tunnel length [[6,7]]. In one innovative case study, fiber optic cables were attached to retaining steel in an underground excavation to measure displacement profiles, providing far more detailed information than traditional inclinometers [[3]].

Geotechnical applications leverage the ability of DOFS to act as "fiber anchors" or "soil nails." In Latvia, a DiTeSt BOTDA system was used to monitor the Plavinu Dam, particularly during the pouring of concrete, to detect internal stresses and potential cracking [[7]]. At the Suzhou borehole in China, a BOTDR system was deployed over 200 meters in depth to monitor soil deformation, using various cable types to find the optimal balance between flexibility and durability [[7]]. Laboratory experiments have shown that OFDR can be used for crack detection in concrete slabs, identifying fissures as narrow as 1 mm [[6]]. Furthermore, DOFS are proving invaluable for pipeline monitoring. The Trans-Andean Pipeline, stretching 408 km through landslide-prone terrain, relies on a continuous BOTDA system to detect slow-moving deformations indicative of geological hazards [[12]]. In laboratory settings, Glisic & Yao used multi-technology DOFS to monitor a 13-meter concrete pipe subjected to ground displacement, showcasing the potential for integrated sensing strategies [[6]].

Concrete infrastructure itself is a primary beneficiary of DOFS technology. Embedding fibers in reinforced concrete beams allows for continuous strain measurement along the member's length, revealing complex strain distributions that point sensors cannot capture [[5,13]]. A study by Weisbrich et al. highlighted the critical importance of proper bonded joint execution for accurate measurements, noting that defects are difficult to detect once embedded in concrete [[1]]. An innovative application in this area is void detection during concrete pouring. In a mockup of an 11-meter tunnel with a 40-cm lining, a fiber placed on the "shoulder" of the pour showed an absence of strain response in areas corresponding to voids, which were later confirmed visually [[3]]. This demonstrates the potential of DOFS not just for monitoring, but for quality control during construction. Finally, the technology is finding its way into unconventional structures, such as the monitoring of full-scale adobe walls during destructive testing to assess seismic vulnerability—a critical application given that earthen constructions house a significant portion of the world's population [[8]].

## Challenges and Open Problems in Deployment

Despite the significant progress and proven successes of Distributed Optical Fiber Sensors (DOFS) in civil engineering, their widespread and fully autonomous deployment is still hindered by a series of persistent challenges and open problems. These issues span the entire lifecycle of a sensor system, from initial installation and data interpretation to long-term reliability and cost-effectiveness. Addressing these hurdles is critical to realizing the full potential of DOFS as a routine and trusted tool for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM).

One of the most fundamental challenges lies in the installation and bonding of the optical fiber to the host structure. The accuracy of the measurement is critically dependent on the quality of the bond between the fiber coating and the structure [[1,6]]. Factors such as surface preparation, the type of adhesive used, and the curing process can significantly affect strain transfer efficiency [[12,14]]. Defective bonds can lead to erroneous readings that are difficult to detect, especially under dynamic loading or in harsh environments [[1]]. Research has shown that polyimide-coated fibers can perform better than nylon-coated ones in terms of strain accuracy, but even then, debonding remains a risk [[6,7]]. To mitigate this, optimal installation techniques are being explored, such as milling grooves into rebar to mechanically anchor the fiber, combined with cyanoacrylate adhesives and protective silicone layers to prevent delamination [[12,13]]. However, these methods require meticulous execution and add complexity to construction processes.

Data interpretation and signal drift present another major obstacle. The raw data from DOFS systems, particularly those based on Rayleigh or Brillouin scattering, can be noisy and difficult to interpret without sophisticated signal processing [[16]]. Environmental fluctuations and long-term aging of the fiber and its coatings can cause a gradual drift in the baseline signal, complicating the identification of true structural events [[9,17]]. This necessitates rigorous calibration procedures, which can be challenging to implement for permanently installed sensors [[9]]. Furthermore, the cross-sensitivity of Brillouin scattering to both strain and temperature poses a significant problem. Separating these two effects to obtain a pure strain measurement often requires a second, independent temperature measurement from a dedicated sensor network or a complex multi-technology setup, adding to the system's cost and complexity [[3,7]].

Long-term durability and reliability under operational loads remain a key concern. Fibers are inherently fragile and susceptible to fatigue and fracture if not properly protected [[6,12]]. The cyclic loading experienced by bridges and buildings, or the constant ground movements in geotechnical applications, can induce micro-bending losses and eventual failure of the fiber. Ensuring the robustness of the fiber and its protective sheathing over the multi-decade lifespan of a civil structure is a non-trivial materials science and engineering challenge. Signal drift and anomalies, such as the mysterious "Strain Reading Anomalies" (SRAs) reported in some installations, further complicate long-term monitoring and require continuous validation against other data sources [[12]].

Finally, the economic viability of deploying large-scale DOFS networks is a significant barrier. While the cost of fiber optic components is decreasing, the total system cost—including the interrogator unit, specialized cabling, installation labor, and data management software—can be substantial, with budgets for major projects estimated to be USD 2000 MM or more [[1,3]]. Although the cost per sensing point decreases as more points are added compared to discrete sensors, the high upfront investment can be prohibitive for many projects. Standardized installation protocols and redundancy design are needed to improve the return on investment and build confidence in the technology's long-term value proposition [[7]]. Overcoming these multifaceted challenges requires a concerted effort involving advances in materials science, signal processing algorithms, and a deeper understanding of the coupled mechanics of fiber-structure interaction.

## Future Research Directions and Concluding Remarks

The future trajectory of Distributed Optical Fiber Sensing (DOFS) for civil engineering SHM is poised for significant transformation, driven by advancements in materials science, data analytics, and system integration. The path forward is not merely about incremental improvements to existing technologies but about developing holistic sensing systems that are more intelligent, resilient, and deeply integrated into the lifecycle of infrastructure. Several key research directions are emerging as critical to unlocking the next generation of smart infrastructure.

A primary frontier is the development of novel fiber designs that can fundamentally overcome the limitations of current silica-based fibers. Hollow-core antiresonant fibers, which guide light through air rather than glass, show immense promise. These fibers exhibit dramatically lower optical loss (<0.11 dB/km demonstrated) and reduced nonlinear effects, which could enable Brillouin-based systems to achieve unprecedented sensing ranges of over 100 km with enhanced precision [[15]]. Such a leap in capability would make continuous, kilometer-scale monitoring of pipelines, levees, and railway corridors a routine reality. Another avenue is the engineering of fibers with tailored properties to solve specific SHM challenges, such as fibers designed to be immune to temperature cross-talk, thereby eliminating a major source of error in strain measurements [[9]].

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is arguably the most impactful future direction. The sheer volume of data generated by continuous, distributed sensing creates a "big data" problem that is beyond human capacity to analyze in real time [[15]]. ML algorithms are already being used to enhance signal interpretation, filter out environmental noise, and automate the detection of anomalies like cracks or debonding [[12,16]]. Future research will focus on developing sophisticated models for predictive analytics, forecasting structural degradation and estimating remaining service life. The ultimate goal is to create self-aware infrastructure that can autonomously diagnose its own condition, alert operators to potential issues, and even recommend maintenance actions, moving the field decisively from reactive to proactive and predictive SHM.

Further integration with digital twin technology represents another synergistic future direction. Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical assets that are continuously updated with real-time data. By feeding the rich, spatially continuous data from DOFS into a digital twin model, engineers can create a highly accurate simulation of a structure's current state. This fusion of physical sensing and computational modeling will enable unprecedented capabilities for structural analysis, damage assessment, and scenario simulation, supporting more informed decision-making throughout the asset's lifecycle [[13]].

In conclusion, DOFS has firmly established itself as a powerful and indispensable technology for the SHM of civil engineering structures. The historical progression from basic reflectometry to sophisticated, multi-parameter systems has enabled a paradigm shift towards continuous, distributed monitoring, offering a level of detail previously unattainable. The current state-of-the-art presents a diverse toolbox of technologies, each with a unique trade-off between spatial resolution, sensing range, and cost, allowing for tailored solutions to a wide array of SHM problems. Case studies from around the world have validated the effectiveness of DOFS in monitoring everything from iconic bridges and tunnels to expansive pipelines and earth-fill dams.

However, the field is not without its challenges. Issues related to installation fidelity, signal interpretation, long-term reliability, and cost must be systematically addressed to facilitate broader adoption. The path forward is clear: continued innovation in fiber optics, the deep integration of AI for intelligent data interpretation, and seamless connection to digital twin platforms are essential to realizing the vision of truly smart and resilient infrastructure. As these research frontiers are pursued, DOFS will continue to evolve, transforming our ability to understand, protect, and maintain the built environment for generations to come.
