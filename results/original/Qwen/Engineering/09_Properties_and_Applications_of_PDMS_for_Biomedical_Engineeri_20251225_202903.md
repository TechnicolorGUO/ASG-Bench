## Introduction

Polydimethylsiloxane, commonly known as PDMS, has become a cornerstone material in the fields of microfluidics and biomedical engineering. Its widespread adoption is rooted in a unique combination of properties that are difficult to replicate in a single, low-cost material. The polymer's backbone consists of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms, with methyl groups attached to the silicon, which imparts its characteristic hydrophobicity and flexibility [[14]]. This intrinsic structure gives rise to a suite of advantageous physical and chemical characteristics, including exceptional optical transparency, high gas permeability, thermal stability over a wide temperature range, and proven biocompatibility with living cells and tissues [[2,9,15]]. These attributes have positioned PDMS as the primary material of choice for rapid prototyping and research-grade fabrication of complex devices such as micro-total-analysis systems (μTAS), organ-on-a-chip (OoC) platforms, biosensors, and tissue engineering scaffolds [[8,16]].

The motivation for this review stems from the profound impact PDMS has had on scientific inquiry and clinical practice, coupled with the persistent challenges associated with its use. While it serves as an indispensable tool for advancing fundamental biological understanding and developing next-generation medical diagnostics, its inherent limitations necessitate continuous innovation. The most significant drawback is its extreme hydrophobicity, which poses a major obstacle for microfluidic applications by causing poor wetting, air bubble entrapment, and non-specific protein adsorption [[7,14,18]]. Furthermore, PDMS exhibits significant swelling and absorption of hydrophobic molecules, including solvents and biomolecules, which can alter device dimensions and contaminate biological assays [[2,10]]. The lack of standardized fabrication and testing protocols has also led to significant inconsistencies in reported mechanical properties, complicating direct comparisons between studies and hindering efforts towards industrial-scale manufacturing [[3,16]].

This review provides a comprehensive systematic analysis of the current state of knowledge regarding PDMS for biomedical engineering. It begins with a foundational overview of its key properties and characterization methods, followed by a critical examination of the techniques used to overcome its surface limitations. Subsequently, the report delves into its diverse applications across hemodynamic modeling, organ-on-a-chip technology, and advanced composites. Finally, it critically assesses the remaining challenges and open problems, identifies key research gaps, and outlines future directions for research aimed at unlocking the full potential of this remarkable material. By synthesizing findings from a broad range of literature, this paper aims to serve as a definitive resource for researchers and engineers navigating the opportunities and constraints of working with PDMS.

## Key Properties and Characterization Methods

The utility of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) in biomedical engineering is fundamentally dictated by its unique and multifaceted material properties. A thorough understanding of these characteristics, how they are measured, and their variability is essential for designing reliable and reproducible devices. PDMS is not a monolithic material; its properties are highly tunable through variations in its formulation, specifically the base-to-curing agent mixing ratio, and are profoundly influenced by the curing protocol, including time and temperature. This section details the primary mechanical, thermal, optical, and surface properties of PDMS, highlighting the significant variations observed in the literature and the importance of standardized characterization.

The mechanical properties of PDMS are central to its application in flexible devices. As a soft elastomer, it exhibits a low Young's modulus, typically ranging from 360 kPa to 3 MPa, which corresponds to a Poisson's ratio of approximately 0.5, indicating near-incompressibility at small strains [[2,4,9,10]]. This low stiffness allows for the creation of deformable structures, such as valves and pumps, integral to microfluidic systems. However, the reported values for Young's modulus show immense variation. Studies have documented moduli spanning several orders of magnitude, from as low as 360 kPa to as high as 2150 kPa or more [[2,10,19]]. This discrepancy is primarily attributed to differences in measurement techniques—such as uniaxial tension, compression, nanoindentation, and cavity-expansion tests—which yield inconsistent results—and more critically, to the curing conditions and the presence of non-reactive additives [[3,6]]. Research by Varner and Cohen (2024) demonstrated that cure temperature has a strong positive correlation with stiffness (2.71 kPa/°C), whereas cure time shows only a weak correlation [[3]]. High-temperature curing (up to 150 °C) increases stiffness, but excessive temperatures (>200 °C) can lead to degradation [[3,6]]. Furthermore, the inclusion of nonreactive silicone oils in the base polymer significantly reduces the final modulus, a factor often overlooked in standard calculations [[3,6]]. To address this variability, authors recommend the use of standardized curing conditions, such as room temperature (~25 °C), moderate temperature (~85 °C), and high temperature (~100–150 °C), to improve data comparability [[6]].

| Property | Typical Value / Range | Measurement Method / Notes | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Young's Modulus** | 360 kPa – 3 MPa | Tension, Compression, Nanoindentation, Cavity Expansion | [[2,9,10,19]] |
| **Shear Modulus** | Information not available in provided sources. | Different methods yield results varying by up to three orders of magnitude. | [[6]] |
| **Poisson's Ratio** | ~0.5 | Digital Image Correlation (DIC) | [[4]] |
| **Ultimate Elongation** | Information not available in provided sources. | Measured after aging for up to 8 weeks. | [[19]] |
| **Hardness (Shore A)** | 41–43 | Sylgard 184; varies with mix ratio and aging. | [[9,10,20]] |
| **Glass Transition Temp.** | -120 °C | Remained constant after aging in modified formulations. | [[20]] |
| **Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE)** | 200–266 ppm K⁻¹ | Reduced by 20% with 0.5 wt.% carbon nanofiber addition. | [[20,23]] |

Thermal properties are another critical consideration, especially for applications involving heat exchange or biological incubation. PDMS demonstrates excellent thermal stability, with a typical operational range from −50 °C to 200 °C [[2,9]]. Its thermal conductivity is relatively low, ranging from 0.2 to 0.27 W/m·K, but this can be enhanced by creating nanocomposites with materials like Al₂O₃ nanoparticles or carbon nanofibers [[9,23]]. Aging studies have shown that incorporating catalysts and silane precursors can increase the thermal stability of PDMS, with the temperature at 5% mass loss (Td5%) increasing by approximately 10% (around 40 °C) after twelve months of aging at 90 °C [[20]]. This indicates that the long-term thermal performance of PDMS can be engineered.

Optical properties are arguably among the most prized features of PDMS. Its high degree of transparency across a broad spectrum makes it ideal for optically-based sensing and imaging. PDMS is transparent from the ultraviolet (down to 240 nm) into the near-infrared region (up to 1100 nm) [[9,22]]. Its refractive index is consistently reported around 1.4 [[9,10]]. Optical transmittance in the visible light spectrum is very high, typically between 75% and 92% [[2]], and can even surpass fused silica glass in certain wavelength ranges [[1]]. This property is maintained even after extensive functionalization, with some PDMS-PEG copolymers retaining over 96% transmittance at 480 nm [[13]]. This optical clarity is fundamental to applications like Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) for flow analysis and real-time cell imaging in OoC systems [[2,10]].

Finally, the surface chemistry of PDMS is dominated by its inherent hydrophobicity, a consequence of the nonpolar methyl groups on its backbone [[14]]. This leads to a high water contact angle (WCA), typically reported between 108° and 120° [[2,10,14]]. This property is the source of many practical challenges, necessitating a wide array of surface modification strategies. The stability of these modifications can be assessed using techniques like X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) to confirm surface composition and Scotch tape peel-off tests to evaluate adhesion strength [[13,17]]. Understanding these core properties and their variability is the first step toward harnessing the full potential of PDMS while mitigating its inherent limitations.

## Surface Modification and Functionalization Strategies

The single most significant limitation of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) for biomedical applications is its extreme hydrophobicity, characterized by a high water contact angle (WCA) often exceeding 100° [[2,10,14]]. This property leads to poor wettability, making it difficult to initiate fluid flow in microchannels without significant pressure, promotes the trapping of air bubbles, and fosters non-specific protein adsorption, which can interfere with cellular processes and analytical measurements [[7,18,22]]. Consequently, a vast body of research has been dedicated to modifying the surface chemistry of PDMS to render it hydrophilic and bioinert. These strategies span a spectrum of complexity, from simple physical treatments to sophisticated covalent grafting techniques, each offering different levels of stability, effectiveness, and ease of implementation.

The simplest and most widely adopted method is plasma treatment, particularly with oxygen (O₂) plasma [[2,14]]. This process introduces polar silanol (Si-OH) groups onto the PDMS surface and simultaneously increases surface roughness, both of which dramatically reduce the WCA [[14]]. For instance, treating Sylgard 184 PDMS for 300 seconds at 70 W can lower the WCA from ~110° to as low as 17° [[14]]. Similarly, combining oxygen plasma with PEG can enable spontaneous capillary flow in microchannels, maintaining hydrophilicity for up to 420 hours [[9]]. However, the primary drawback of plasma treatment is its temporary nature. The newly created Si-OH groups are unstable, and the surface tends to revert back to its original hydrophobic state within hours or days as low molecular weight (LMW) polymer chains migrate to the surface to minimize free energy [[14,22]]. This "hydrophobic recovery" can be delayed by storing the treated PDMS in deionized water or vacuum, or by physically removing the LMW chains through solvent extraction or thermal aging [[14]].

A related technique is UV-ozone exposure, which achieves a similar effect to plasma treatment but requires longer exposure times (e.g., 60–120 minutes) [[14]]. While effective, it shares the same fundamental instability issue as plasma treatment. An alternative physical approach involves the bulk incorporation of surfactants or amphiphilic polymers directly into the PDMS prepolymer mixture before curing [[7,14]]. For example, adding Pluronic® F127 to the base polymer was found to reduce the WCA from 104° to 63° after being submerged in water for 24 hours [[14]]. Another study showed that bulk doping with 2.5% PEO reduced the WCA to 35.2°, enabling efficient passive plasma separation in a microfluidic device [[7]]. While this method provides a more stable solution than post-cure plasma treatment, the effectiveness can diminish over time as the surfactant leaches out of the polymer matrix.

To achieve more robust and long-lasting modifications, chemical functionalization strategies are employed. These methods involve forming covalent bonds between the PDMS surface and a functional molecule, ensuring superior stability against washing and prolonged use. One powerful technique is plasma polymerization, where a monomer like acrylic acid is polymerized on the PDMS surface under vacuum [[12]]. This creates a stable, patterned hydrophilic layer that can last for several days and has been used to generate double emulsions in PDMS microchannels—the first time this has been achieved [[12]]. Another covalent strategy involves "grafting-from" methods, where initiators are attached to the PDMS surface and used to grow polymer chains directly from it. Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) is a prime example, allowing for the growth of dense polymer brushes like poly(acrylamide) [[18,22]]. Grafting poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) via ATRP has been shown to improve lysozyme resistance 20-fold and maintain hydrophilicity for at least one month [[22]]. Similarly, grafting zwitterionic polymers like PMPC can achieve >98% reduction in fibrinogen adsorption [[22]].

For applications requiring biologically active surfaces, "grafting-to" methods are also used, where pre-synthesized functional polymers are attached to the PDMS surface [[18,22]]. Examples include attaching epoxide-modified PVA or PVP, which significantly reduce BSA and lysozyme adsorption [[18,22]]. A particularly elegant approach is the use of PDMS-PEG block copolymers. By blending a small amount (e.g., 0.25%) of a PDMS-PEG copolymer directly into the base prepolymer, the PEG chains spontaneously segregate to the surface during curing, creating a stable, hydrophilic, and non-fouling interface [[13]]. This method has been shown to reduce protein adsorption by ~90%, preserve high optical clarity (>99%), and support high cell viability (>99%) for over three days in a liver-on-a-chip model [[13]]. In summary, while simple plasma treatment offers a quick, albeit transient, fix for hydrophobicity, the development of stable, covalently bonded surface layers represents a crucial advancement for creating reliable and robust biomedical devices from PDMS.

## Applications in Hemodynamics and Biomodeling

The combination of biocompatibility, optical transparency, and gas permeability makes polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) an ideal material for fabricating in vitro models of the human circulatory system. These biomodels are instrumental in studying hemodynamics, investigating the effects of pathological geometries like aneurysms and stenoses, and analyzing the behavior of blood cells under controlled flow conditions [[2,21]]. The ability to create transparent, flexible replicas of patient-specific vascular structures has revolutionized cardiovascular research, providing a platform to validate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models and test medical devices in physiologically relevant environments [[10]].

PDMS-based hemodynamic models are often created using lost-core casting techniques, where a sacrificial material mimicking a blood vessel is embedded in a PDMS mold and later dissolved to create a hollow channel [[10]]. Materials used for the core can include sucrose, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), paraffin, or even 3D-printed water-dissolvable resins, allowing for the replication of intricate and patient-specific anatomies with high fidelity [[10]]. These models can be used to study aneurysms, coronary arteries, and carotid arteries, enabling researchers to analyze the complex interplay between blood flow and the arterial wall [[9,10]]. For instance, studies have used PDMS models of stenotic carotid arteries to investigate how stenosis severity (e.g., 30%, 50%, 70% blockage) affects shear stress and turbulence, finding that greater stenosis leads to increased turbulence and higher turbulent kinetic energy [[10]]. Crucially, flexible PDMS models can mimic the pulsatile flow of real blood vessels, revealing that rigid models underestimate turbulent kinetic energy compared to their flexible counterparts [[10]].

Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is a key experimental technique used to quantify flow within these PDMS biomodels [[2,10]]. By seeding the blood analogue with tracer particles and illuminating them with a laser sheet, high-speed cameras capture the particle motion, which is then analyzed to reconstruct the velocity field. This allows for detailed validation of CFD simulations and provides insights into phenomena like recirculation zones, vortex shedding, and wall shear stress distribution [[10]]. Endothelial cell culture within these channels enables the study of mechanotransduction, where cells sense and respond to fluid shear stress. PDMS's biocompatibility supports the growth of endothelial cells (like HUVECs), allowing for the investigation of how altered hemodynamics contribute to vascular diseases [[2]].

Beyond static models, PDMS is used to create dynamic platforms for studying individual cell behavior. Microfluidic devices featuring constricted channels, fabricated from PDMS, allow for the precise analysis of red blood cell (RBC) deformability, a critical parameter in diagnosing diseases like malaria [[10]]. Early work by Shelby et al. utilized PDMS constrictions to analyze the deformability of malaria-infected RBCs [[10]]. More recent designs, such as hyperbolic or sudden-contraction microchannels, induce uniform extensional flow, enabling accurate measurement of RBC elasticity and identification of changes caused by disease or nanoparticle exposure [[10]]. For example, a hyperbolic microchannel device was developed to assess RBC deformability changes due to magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, showing a reduction in maximum deformability [[10]]. Furthermore, PDMS-based crossflow filtration devices have been designed to separate blood components, such as separating plasma from whole blood for diagnostic purposes, using principles of size exclusion and inertial focusing [[10]]. The development of a sustainable PDMS face mask with a transparent window, achieving high filtration efficiency and optical transmittance comparable to medical standards, further showcases the versatility of PDMS in creating novel biomedical products [[9]]. These applications collectively demonstrate that PDMS provides an unparalleled platform for bridging the gap between large-scale physiological models and single-cell biophysics.

## Advanced Platforms: Organ-on-a-Chip and Nanocomposites

Beyond static biomodels, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) serves as the foundational material for the rapidly advancing field of Organ-on-a-Chip (OoC) technology. OoCs are microfluidic devices that aim to replicate the key physiological functions of living organs on a chip, offering a more predictive alternative to traditional cell cultures and animal models for drug testing, toxicity screening, and disease modeling [[8,16]]. The success of OoC platforms hinges on PDMS's unique properties: its transparency for real-time, label-free live-cell imaging; its gas permeability to support long-term cell viability; and its softness, which allows for the integration of mechanical stimuli [[9,21]]. Researchers have successfully developed PDMS-based OoCs representing multiple organ systems, including lung, liver, heart, brain, and gut, as well as multi-organ chips that simulate systemic interactions [[8,10]].

In these platforms, PDMS is used to create intricate networks of microchannels lined with living human cells. For example, a brain-on-a-chip model developed by Jeong et al. uses a PDMS device with 16 intersecting microchannels to co-culture primary neurovascular endothelial cells and astrocytes, effectively creating a simplified blood-brain barrier [[8]]. A key feature of this device is the integration of sensors to monitor the integrity of the barrier in real-time. Specifically, transepithelial/transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements were performed to track changes in barrier function under shear stress, demonstrating the capability for dynamic assessment [[8]]. Other integrated sensors include electrochemical sensors for detecting metabolites, strain gauges for measuring tissue contraction, and optical sensors for monitoring oxygen consumption, which varies significantly between different cell types (e.g., NHDF fibroblasts consume 183 hPa vs. HUVEC endothelial cells at 28.4 hPa) [[8]]. These integrated sensing capabilities provide rich, quantitative data that is critical for understanding organ-level responses.

While PDMS excels in many biomedical applications, its inherent weaknesses, such as low mechanical strength and high susceptibility to swelling, have driven the development of advanced composites and reinforced structures. To enhance its mechanical properties, researchers have incorporated various fillers into the PDMS matrix. Carbon nanofibers (CFs) have been used to create CF-filled PDMS composites, which show a significant increase in Young's modulus (from 1.13 MPa for pristine PDMS to 1.76 MPa at 4 wt.% CF) and hardness (to 39.1 Shore A). However, this reinforcement comes at the cost of reduced elongation and toughness, with optimal performance observed at a CF loading of 2 wt.%, where the modulus plateaus and toughness loss is minimized [[23]]. Other reinforcing agents, such as silica fibers, have also been shown to improve tensile properties [[15]].

Another promising avenue for enhancement is improving thermal properties. Creating PDMS nanocomposites with nanoparticles like aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) has been shown to enhance thermal conductivity while preserving the material's flexibility, which is beneficial for applications like acoustofluidics and heat transfer systems [[9]]. Furthermore, PDMS is increasingly being used as a host matrix for embedding other functional materials. For instance, a secondary PDMS prepolymer layer was spin-coated to entrap hydrogel particles, forming an interpenetrating polymer network that could be used for controlled drug release [[17]]. Medical implants have also benefited from composite approaches. PDMS-tantalum oxide hybrids and CuO-PDMS-SiO₂ composites have been developed as coatings to improve osseointegration, corrosion resistance, and antibacterial properties of implants [[2]]. Even more innovative is the use of flame treatment to generate nanostructures on PDMS surfaces that form super-hydrophobic and superoleophobic coatings, which can be combined with soot to create mechanically durable composites with high biocompatibility and anti-coagulation properties, showing great potential for implantable devices [[1]]. These advancements in composite materials expand the functional envelope of PDMS, pushing its application beyond what is possible with the neat polymer alone.

## Challenges, Limitations, and Future Directions

Despite its revolutionary impact, the continued use and commercialization of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are constrained by a set of fundamental challenges and limitations. Addressing these issues is paramount for translating research-grade devices into robust, scalable, and clinically viable products. The most prominent obstacles identified in the literature include the lack of standardized fabrication protocols leading to property variability, the inherent hydrophobicity causing non-specific fouling, the absorption of small molecules, and difficulties in achieving industrial-scale production [[2,3,16]].

The greatest challenge lies in the lack of a universally accepted protocol for fabricating and characterizing PDMS. As detailed previously, the material's properties are exquisitely sensitive to minor variations in the base-to-curing agent ratio, degassing time, curing temperature, and curing duration [[3,6,19]]. This has resulted in a bewildering range of reported mechanical properties, making it difficult to compare results across different studies and hindering the development of reliable design rules [[3]]. Standardizing these parameters—specifically recommending consistent curing schedules—is a critical first step toward resolving this issue [[3,6]]. Another major hurdle is the high fabrication cost and labor-intensity associated with conventional soft-lithography, which remains a significant barrier to commercialization, despite the material's low cost itself [[16]].

Future research must focus on overcoming these limitations through a multi-pronged approach. First, establishing and disseminating best practices for PDMS fabrication is essential. This includes rigorous documentation of all processing steps and the development of standardized test methods for reporting mechanical properties. Efforts should also be directed toward automating the fabrication process to reduce costs and increase throughput. The development of new PDMS formulations with improved properties is another promising direction. For example, thermally stable variants with extended gel points and reduced discoloration at elevated temperatures could broaden its applicability in high-throughput screening and sterilization processes [[20]].

Second, there is a need for more durable and predictable surface modification strategies. While current methods can render PDMS hydrophilic, their long-term stability remains a concern. Future work should focus on developing covalent bonding techniques that are not only robust but also compatible with complex, multi-step device assembly. Investigating novel functional polymers, such as advanced zwitterionic materials, that offer superior resistance to protein adsorption and biofouling over extended periods is a key research gap [[22]]. Additionally, integrating these stable surfaces seamlessly into the device fabrication workflow without compromising device integrity is a critical engineering challenge.

Third, the push for industrial-scale manufacturing must continue. While 3D printing is a promising emerging technology for rapid prototyping, its ability to produce devices with the necessary precision, surface finish, and repeatability for high-volume manufacturing is still being explored [[8]]. Research should focus on optimizing 3D printing processes (e.g., SLA, FDM) and developing printable PDMS formulations that can match the performance of cast PDMS. Improving the dimensional stability and mechanical integrity of 3D-printed PDMS parts will be crucial for this transition [[11]].

Finally, the development of advanced composites and hybrid materials will be a major driver of innovation. Future research should explore new filler materials and architectures to enhance specific properties, such as mechanical strength, thermal conductivity, or electrical conductivity, without degrading others. The goal is to create "smart" PDMS composites that can perform multiple functions, such as acting as a structural component, a sensor, and a drug delivery vehicle, all within a single integrated device. In conclusion, while PDMS has served as an invaluable tool for scientific discovery, its future depends on addressing its inherent limitations. By pursuing solutions to the challenges of standardization, surface stability, manufacturability, and property enhancement, the field can unlock the full potential of PDMS for transformative biomedical technologies.
