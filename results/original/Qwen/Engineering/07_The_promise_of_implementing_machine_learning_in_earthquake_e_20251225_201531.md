## Introduction and Background

The integration of machine learning (ML) into earthquake engineering represents a paradigm shift, promising to enhance the resilience and safety of civil infrastructure against one of nature's most destructive forces. This field, traditionally reliant on physics-based simulations and empirical models, is now being augmented by data-driven techniques capable of identifying complex patterns and making predictions that are often beyond the scope of conventional methods. The motivation for this deep integration stems from the inherent challenges in accurately predicting seismic events and assessing their impact on structures. Seismicity itself is a chaotic phenomenon, characterized by immense variability in fault rupture processes, wave propagation paths, and local soil conditions. Traditional ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs), while valuable, often fail to capture these nuances, leading to significant uncertainty in seismic hazard assessments [[1]]. Similarly, structural performance under extreme seismic loads involves highly non-linear behaviors, damage accumulation, and failure mechanisms that are difficult to model with high fidelity using standard finite element analysis alone [[2]].

Machine learning offers a powerful alternative or complement to these traditional approaches. Its core strength lies in its ability to learn complex, non-linear relationships directly from data without requiring explicit mathematical formulations. For instance, ML models can be trained on vast catalogs of historical earthquakes to identify subtle precursors or patterns indicative of an impending event, potentially improving earthquake prediction accuracy [[4,6]]. In the realm of structural health monitoring (SHM), ML algorithms can analyze sensor data to detect damage at its earliest stages, even before it becomes visible, thereby enabling proactive maintenance and preventing catastrophic failures [[3,11]]. Furthermore, ML can significantly accelerate the computational process of seismic risk assessment by creating surrogate models that mimic the behavior of computationally expensive physics-based simulations, allowing for rapid evaluation of thousands of potential scenarios [[5]]. The promise of implementing ML is therefore not just incremental improvement but transformative potential, offering a pathway toward more accurate, efficient, and reliable strategies for mitigating seismic risk.

This review provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art analysis of ML applications in earthquake engineering. It synthesizes findings from foundational research and recent advancements to present a holistic view of the current landscape. The primary objectives are to systematically categorize the key ML methodologies, document their successful application across the entire earthquake engineering workflow—from hazard assessment to post-disaster recovery—and critically evaluate the field's major strengths and weaknesses. By examining the technical hurdles such as data scarcity and model interpretability, this review aims to provide a clear picture of the challenges that must be overcome. Finally, it identifies critical research gaps and outlines future trajectories, including the rise of physics-informed models and the integration of ML with emerging technologies like digital twins and cyberinfrastructure. The ultimate goal is to serve as a definitive reference for researchers and practitioners, illuminating the path forward for leveraging artificial intelligence to build a more resilient world.

## Key Concepts and Historical Development

The application of machine learning in earthquake engineering is built upon a foundation of diverse algorithmic families and has evolved through distinct phases of development. Understanding these key concepts and their historical progression is essential to appreciating the field's current capabilities and future potential. The evolution can be broadly categorized into three main eras: the early explorations of neural networks, the mainstream adoption of established ML algorithms, and the recent revolutionary surge in deep learning and hybrid methodologies.

The earliest forays into applying ML in related structural engineering contexts date back to the 1990s. Foundational works include the use of neural networks for structural damage detection reported in *Computers & Structures* in 1992 [[1]], and pioneering research on neural network-based reliability analysis combined with Monte Carlo simulation published in *Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering* in 1996 [[1]]. These initial studies laid the groundwork for applying data-driven methods to problems of structural integrity and performance assessment. The first systematic reviews focusing on the period between 1989 and 2000 began to consolidate these efforts, providing a structured overview of how neural networks were being applied to tasks like SHM [[1]].

The subsequent decade saw the mainstreaming of more general-purpose ML techniques. A comprehensive review published in *Archive of Computational Methods in Engineering* in 2021 covers the extensive use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Learning architectures like VGG16 and ResNet, and Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) in SHM for various infrastructures including bridges and buildings [[3]]. During this period, SVMs gained particular prominence due to their effectiveness in classification and regression tasks, especially when enhanced with optimization algorithms for hyperparameter tuning [[2]]. This era also solidified the distinction between vibration-based SHM, which relies on accelerometers and other dynamic sensors, and image-based SHM, which uses visual data from cameras [[3]].

The third and most transformative phase is characterized by the ascendancy of deep learning and the emergence of sophisticated hybrid models. This period was catalyzed by seminal works that demonstrated the power of deep architectures for complex pattern recognition. For example, the "Earthquake Transformer" model, developed in 2020, showcased the ability of transformer architectures to simultaneously detect earthquakes and pick their arrival phases with high precision [[4]]. Concurrently, the concept of Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) began to gain traction around 2017-2019, marking a paradigm shift away from purely black-box models [[13,14]]. Pioneering papers introduced Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which embed physical laws, typically expressed as partial differential equations (PDEs), directly into the ML training process via the loss function [[7,14]]. This approach aims to create models that are not only data-driven but also physically consistent, addressing long-standing issues of interpretability and generalization. The scientometric analysis of 3,189 papers confirms this trend, showing a dominant focus on seismic design and a growing body of work in earthquake prediction and post-earthquake assessment, underscoring the broad applicability of these advanced ML techniques [[6]].

This evolution reflects a maturation of the field from simple pattern recognition to sophisticated, multi-modal problem-solving. The journey from early neural networks to today's large-scale, physics-integrated models illustrates a continuous drive towards greater accuracy, efficiency, and trustworthiness, paving the way for ML to become an indispensable tool in earthquake engineering.

## Current State-of-the-Art Methodologies

The current state-of-the-art in applying machine learning to earthquake engineering is defined by a rich and diverse ecosystem of algorithms, ranging from classical supervised learning models to cutting-edge deep learning architectures and novel hybrid frameworks. These methodologies are not mutually exclusive but are increasingly being combined in sophisticated ways to tackle the multifaceted challenges of the field. The choice of methodology depends heavily on the specific task, the nature of available data, and the desired balance between predictive accuracy and model interpretability.

Supervised learning forms the bedrock of many ML applications in this domain. Models such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression are widely used for classification and regression tasks [[5]]. SVMs, particularly when enhanced with kernel functions and optimized with algorithms like Genetic Algorithms (GA) or Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), have proven effective for classifying damage states. For instance, a GA-SVM model achieved 98.16% accuracy in a study by Liu and Jiao [[2]]. Ensemble methods like XGBoost are also prominent, having been successfully applied to predict the shear strength and load-carrying capacity of structural elements [[1]]. While these models are powerful, they often require careful feature engineering, where domain experts extract relevant information from raw data before feeding it to the algorithm.

Deep learning has revolutionized the field by automating feature extraction and handling high-dimensional data with unprecedented success. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the go-to architecture for image-based tasks. They are used extensively for damage identification from visual data, including crack detection in concrete surfaces using images from depth cameras [[3]] and 2D-CNNs processing time-frequency representations of sensor data [[2]]. Studies have reported remarkable accuracies, such as 98.437% on bridge data and 100% on truss bridge data using CNNs [[2]]. Beyond static images, CNNs are also used in U-net architectures for precise pixel-level segmentation of cracks in construction materials [[1]]. For analyzing sequential data like acceleration records from seismographs or accelerometers, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their advanced variant, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are paramount. LSTMs excel at modeling temporal dependencies and have been used for predicting seismic loading [[8]], forecasting structural responses, and developing real-time prediction models [[15]]. More recently, transformer-based models, inspired by their success in natural language processing, have been adapted for seismology. The "Earthquake Transformer" is a prime example, demonstrating superior performance in simultaneous earthquake detection and phase picking compared to traditional methods [[4]].

A paradigm-shifting trend in the state-of-the-art is the development of hybrid and physics-informed models. Recognizing the limitations of purely data-driven black-box models—namely their lack of interpretability and poor generalization to unseen conditions—the field is moving towards integrating physical knowledge directly into the ML framework [[5,9]]. Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) encompasses several approaches. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are perhaps the most prominent, embedding governing physical laws, such as the equation of motion (`Mx'' + Cx' + Kx = F`), directly into the neural network's loss function [[10,14]]. This constrains the model to find solutions that are physically plausible, significantly enhancing robustness, especially with sparse datasets [[7]]. Variants include multi-end PIDL models that incorporate resonance effects into the loss function [[8]] and Empirical-Guided Machine Learning (EGML), which integrates empirical rules (e.g., monotonic relationships between material properties and structural capacity) into the model to prevent physically implausible predictions [[12]]. Another powerful hybrid approach involves coupling ML models with physics-based simulations. Here, a finite element model (FEM) might be used to generate a large, synthetic dataset for training an ML model, or the ML model can be used to refine parameters within the FEM, creating a synergistic loop that improves both the simulation and the data-driven model [[2]].

Finally, the toolkit continues to expand with other specialized techniques. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as a powerful tool for modeling the interconnectedness of structural systems, representing components as nodes and their connections as edges [[4]]. Reinforcement learning is being explored for developing intelligent control systems that can actively mitigate structural vibrations during an earthquake [[4]]. Unsupervised methods like autoencoders and one-class SVMs are crucial for anomaly detection, identifying unusual structural behavior that may indicate undetected damage without needing labeled examples of damage [[2]]. This diverse and rapidly evolving set of methodologies underscores a dynamic field that is constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible in earthquake engineering.

## Applications and Case Studies

The practical application of machine learning in earthquake engineering spans the entire lifecycle of a structure, from pre-event planning and design to post-event recovery and reconstruction. The provided literature showcases a wide array of successful case studies that demonstrate the versatility and power of these data-driven techniques in addressing critical challenges in seismic risk management. These applications can be broadly categorized into four main domains: seismic hazard analysis and prediction, structural health monitoring and damage detection, seismic performance assessment and fragility analysis, and structural control and retrofitting.

In the domain of seismic hazard analysis and prediction, ML models are being deployed to improve the accuracy and timeliness of forecasts. Research focuses on regional earthquake prediction using catalogs of past seismic events and advanced signal processing techniques [[6]]. A notable application is the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to develop earthquake early warning systems. One such system was able to issue alerts based on the initial P-wave arrivals detected by the CNN, providing precious seconds of warning before the more destructive S-waves arrive [[4]]. Another study proposed a physics-informed deep learning model specifically designed for real-time prediction of structural seismic time-history responses, which was validated using actual building data from the Center for Engineering Strong Motion Data (CESMD) [[15]]. These systems represent a significant leap towards proactive disaster management. Furthermore, ML is being used for data-driven seismic hazard and risk assessment, leveraging remote sensing data and other geospatial information to create more granular and accurate risk maps [[4]].

Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and damage detection constitute one of the most mature and impactful areas for ML application. The goal here is to continuously assess the condition of a structure and identify damage at its earliest stages. ML algorithms are applied to both vibration-based and image-based data streams. Vibration-based methods use signals from accelerometers and strain gauges. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used for dimensionality reduction, while wavelet transforms (WT) and Hilbert-Huang Transforms (HHT) are employed for feature extraction from non-stationary signals [[2]]. These features are then fed into classifiers like ANNs and SVMs. CNNs have emerged as a particularly powerful tool, capable of processing raw time-series data or derived time-frequency images. Several studies have reported near-perfect accuracy in damage classification. For instance, Wang et al. [51] used a CNN with HHT-transformed data to achieve 100% accuracy on benchmark SHM data, and Zhang and Wang [106] reached 100% on truss bridge data [[2]]. Image-based SHM leverages computer vision, with CNNs detecting and quantifying surface cracks from photographs taken by drones or fixed cameras [[1,3]]. This approach is invaluable for inspecting large and hard-to-reach structures like dams and bridges.

Seismic performance assessment and fragility analysis involve evaluating how structures will behave during an earthquake and estimating their probability of exceeding certain damage states. ML models are used to classify failure modes and predict residual performance after a seismic event [[1,6]]. Deep learning models are applied for detailed damage identification and evaluation of a structure's remaining service life [[6]]. A key advantage of ML is its ability to act as a surrogate for computationally intensive finite element models. This allows engineers to run thousands of simulations with varying ground motions and structural parameters to build comprehensive fragility curves efficiently [[5]]. For example, ensemble algorithms are frequently used to predict the performance of structural materials, such as the compressive strength of concrete, which is a critical input for any performance assessment model [[6]].

While less prominently featured in the provided context, the application of ML in structural control and retrofitting is a promising frontier. Reinforcement learning algorithms are being investigated for designing adaptive control systems that can adjust in real-time to mitigate the effects of seismic shaking [[4]]. Although no specific case studies were detailed, the principle is analogous to using ML to optimize control inputs for active mass dampers or magnetorheological fluid-based systems. The table below summarizes some key case studies mentioned in the literature, illustrating the breadth of applications.

These diverse applications underscore the transformative impact of machine learning, moving earthquake engineering from a reactive discipline to a more predictive and prescriptive science.

## Challenges and Open Problems

Despite the significant progress and promising results, the widespread and reliable implementation of machine learning in earthquake engineering is constrained by a set of formidable challenges and open problems. These issues span the data pipeline, model development, and practical deployment, and addressing them is critical for unlocking the full potential of AI in this field. The most pervasive challenge is data scarcity and quality. Training robust and generalizable ML models requires vast quantities of high-quality, diverse data, which are often unavailable in earthquake engineering [[1,3]]. For many applications, collecting sufficient real-world seismic data is a matter of years or decades. Consequently, there is a heavy reliance on numerical simulations and laboratory experiments. However, models trained exclusively on simulated data often struggle to generalize to the complexities and imperfections of the real world, a problem known as the sim-to-real gap [[10]]. The limited availability of public, standardized datasets further hinders reproducibility and comparative studies, slowing down collective progress [[3,6]]. Even when data is abundant, ensuring its quality and managing noise remains a significant hurdle.

A second major challenge is the "black box" nature of many advanced ML models, which leads to a lack of interpretability and trust. While a deep neural network may produce an accurate prediction, understanding *why* it made that prediction is often impossible. This opacity is a significant barrier to adoption in a field where decisions can have life-or-death consequences. Engineers and regulators need to understand the reasoning behind a model's output to trust it implicitly. This is particularly acute in post-earthquake safety assessments, where a model's justification for declaring a building safe to reoccupy must be transparent and defensible [[4]]. The tendency of purely data-driven models to produce physically implausible outputs, such as a structural capacity decreasing with increased reinforcement, further erodes confidence and highlights the need for models that adhere to fundamental physical principles [[12]].

Model generalization is another persistent open problem. An ML model trained on data from one specific structure or region may perform poorly when applied to another [[1,2]]. Environmental factors, such as temperature fluctuations, can alter a structure's modal frequencies, causing the model to misinterpret these benign changes as signs of damage [[2]]. Similarly, the unique characteristics of different soil types, construction materials, and architectural styles mean that a model's performance cannot be easily extrapolated. Achieving robust generalization requires either massive, heterogeneous datasets that cover all possible scenarios—a near-impossible task—or the development of more sophisticated models that can abstract underlying principles rather than memorizing specific instances. This is where hybrid approaches, particularly those incorporating physics-informed constraints, show considerable promise by imposing universal physical laws that transcend specific structural details [[7,9]].

Finally, there are significant practical challenges related to computational cost, real-time implementation, and sensor deployment. Training large deep learning models can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, requiring access to high-performance computing resources [[10]]. For applications requiring real-time decision-making, such as earthquake early warning systems or active structural control, the latency of inference must be minimized [[11]]. Deploying and maintaining a dense network of sensors required for comprehensive SHM in real-world environments presents logistical and financial challenges [[11]]. Optimizing sensor placement to capture the most critical information without an excessive number of sensors is an active area of research [[2]]. Overcoming these multifaceted challenges will require a concerted effort involving data collection initiatives, the development of more interpretable and robust algorithms, and innovative hardware-software co-design for real-time systems.

## Future Research Directions and Emerging Trends

The future of machine learning in earthquake engineering is poised for explosive growth, driven by a confluence of technological advancements and a strategic shift in research priorities. The trajectory points towards more integrated, intelligent, and trustworthy systems that blur the lines between data-driven discovery and physics-based understanding. Four key trends are shaping this future: the maturation of physics-informed and hybrid models, the push for explainable AI, the deep integration with cyberinfrastructure and digital twins, and the collaborative effort to build large-scale, shared benchmarks.

The most significant future direction is the continued evolution of Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML). The limitations of purely data-driven models have catalyzed a movement to embed physical laws directly into the learning process [[5,9]]. This approach promises to solve some of the most pressing challenges, including poor generalization and a lack of interpretability. Future research will likely focus on developing more sophisticated methods for integrating physics, such as using Koopman theory or advanced numerical methods for PDEs as part of the neural network architecture [[13]]. There is also a strong push towards creating automated frameworks for discovering the correct physical laws from data, reducing the need for manual handcrafting of loss functions [[13]]. As PIML matures, we can expect to see models that are not only more accurate but also provide deeper insights into the underlying physics of structural behavior under seismic loads.

The demand for transparency and accountability will fuel the development of Explainable AI (XAI). To be fully trusted by engineers and regulatory bodies, ML models must be able to justify their predictions. Future work will focus on integrating XAI techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) into the standard ML workflow [[1]]. These tools can help visualize which features (e.g., specific sensor readings or material properties) contributed most to a model's decision, providing a level of scrutiny previously unavailable. This will be crucial for applications like seismic risk assessment and post-earthquake building safety evaluations, where the "reasoning" behind a recommendation is as important as the recommendation itself [[4]].

The integration of ML with cyberinfrastructure and the concept of digital twins represents another transformative trend. Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical assets that are continuously updated with real-time data from sensors. By combining real-time monitoring data with physics-informed ML models, digital twins can provide a dynamic, predictive, and up-to-date assessment of a structure's health and performance throughout its lifecycle [[9,14]]. This goes far beyond periodic inspections or post-event assessments. Future research will focus on creating scalable and robust digital twin platforms that integrate seamlessly with ML models for predictive maintenance, real-time damage detection, and proactive risk mitigation for critical infrastructure like bridges and tunnels [[14]]. Initiatives like DesignSafe-CI are already providing the necessary cyberinfrastructure for sharing data and running large-scale simulations, forming the backbone for these next-generation systems [[1,7]].

Finally, the community is recognizing that progress is severely hampered by a lack of standardized, publicly available datasets. A concerted effort is underway to address this through the development of large-scale benchmark datasets. A prime example is the PEER Hub ImageNet initiative, aimed at creating a comprehensive database for image-based damage detection [[1]]. Such repositories are essential for enabling fair comparisons between different ML models, fostering reproducible research, and accelerating innovation. Future directions will also explore the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment existing datasets by generating realistic synthetic data, helping to overcome the data scarcity problem [[2]]. This collaborative effort to build shared resources will democratize access to data and empower a wider range of researchers to contribute to the field. Together, these trends point towards a future where ML is not just a tool, but an integral and indispensable partner in the quest for safer, more resilient infrastructure.

## Conclusion

This review has provided a comprehensive state-of-the-art analysis of the application of machine learning in earthquake engineering, charting its evolution from early neural network experiments to the sophisticated deep learning and hybrid models of today. The evidence overwhelmingly indicates that ML holds immense promise for transforming the field, offering powerful new tools to address long-standing challenges in seismic hazard assessment, structural health monitoring, and performance prediction. The journey has progressed from simple, rule-based systems to complex, data-driven models capable of identifying subtle patterns in vast datasets, and is now entering a new era defined by the fusion of data with physical knowledge through Physics-Informed Machine Learning.

The current landscape is characterized by a diverse and expanding toolkit of algorithms, from the robust and interpretable SVMs to the highly accurate but opaque deep learning architectures like CNNs and LSTMs [[2,4]]. The field's greatest strength lies in this diversity, allowing for tailored solutions to a wide array of problems. However, this progress is tempered by significant challenges, including data scarcity, the black-box nature of many models, poor generalization, and difficulties in real-time implementation [[1,2]]. These hurdles have catalyzed a critical shift in research focus towards developing more robust, interpretable, and physics-aware models. The emergence of PIML, XAI, and digital twins represents a maturation of the field, moving beyond mere prediction to foster trust and actionable insight.

To summarize, the key findings of this review are that the integration of ML is fundamentally reshaping earthquake engineering. The most impactful trend is the move towards hybrid models that combine the flexibility of data-driven learning with the consistency of physical principles. This synthesis addresses the core weaknesses of pure ML and paves the way for models that are not only accurate but also generalizable and trustworthy. The future of the field hinges on overcoming the persistent challenges of data acquisition and model interpretability. The ongoing development of large-scale, curated benchmark datasets and the integration of explainable AI techniques are paramount for validating and deploying these advanced models in practice. Ultimately, the successful implementation of machine learning promises to enhance our ability to predict seismic events, monitor the health of our infrastructure in real-time, and design more resilient structures, thereby safeguarding lives and property on a global scale.
