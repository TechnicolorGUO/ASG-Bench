## Introduction and Background

The confluence of digital technologies and entrepreneurial activity has given rise to a new paradigm that is fundamentally reshaping the landscape of innovation, economic development, and societal progress. Digital entrepreneurship, defined as the creation and pursuit of opportunities through technological platforms and information communication equipment [[12]], represents more than just the digitization of traditional business models. It embodies a profound shift in how value is created, distributed, and measured. This phenomenon is characterized by the ability of individuals and organizations to leverage the core properties of digital technology—such as reprogrammability, recombinability, and generativity—to rapidly prototype, scale, and iterate on novel business models and services [[4,10]]. The emergence of global platforms like Airbnb, Uber, and YouTube, which enable resource sharing and direct-to-consumer market access without significant physical assets, serves as a testament to this transformative power [[11]].

The significance of this transformation extends beyond the private sector into the very heart of national and regional innovation systems. An innovation system can be understood as the network of institutions whose interactions determine the rate and direction of technological change within a country or region [[2]]. These systems are comprised of actors in the public and private sectors, along with linkages between them, that are responsible for developing and diffusing new technologies. Digital entrepreneurship acts as both an accelerator and an agent of change within these systems. On one hand, it drives demand for new infrastructure, skills, and policies. On the other, it generates entirely new forms of innovation that challenge existing industry structures and regulatory frameworks. For instance, the digital transformation of established firms like GE and Boeing demonstrates the pressure on incumbent players to adapt their innovation processes to remain competitive [[4]].

This review is motivated by the urgent need to understand the complex interplay between digital entrepreneurship and innovation systems, particularly in the context of fostering sustainable transitions. A sustainable transition refers to the systemic shift away from unsustainable practices toward models that balance environmental health, social equity, and economic prosperity. Frameworks such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a global roadmap for this endeavor [[17]]. The role of innovation is paramount in achieving these goals, yet conventional approaches have often fallen short due to their focus on incremental technological improvements while failing to address the deeper organizational and systemic barriers to change [[15]]. Business model innovation (BMI), a critical enabler of societal transitions, has been identified as a key missing link in many transition theories, which tend to prioritize technological artifacts over the organizational innovations required to bring them to market [[15]]. Digital entrepreneurship offers a powerful mechanism to bridge this gap, providing the agility and innovative capacity needed to design and implement new business models that underpin sustainability, such as those in the circular economy or shared mobility sectors [[15]].

The objective of this systematic literature review is to synthesize the current body of knowledge on digital entrepreneurship, its defining characteristics, its evolution, and its relationship with innovation ecosystems. We aim to critically analyze the methods used to study this field and explore its demonstrated applications and impacts. Furthermore, by identifying the prevailing challenges and open research problems, we seek to chart a course for future scholarly inquiry. Specifically, this report will delve into the potential of digital entrepreneurship to catalyze sustainable transitions, examining the evidence linking digital ecosystem maturity to SDG achievement and exploring how digital tools can enhance social entrepreneurship and value measurement [[17,21]]. By providing a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art and highlighting critical gaps, this review aims to serve as a foundational resource for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners working to harness the power of digital technology for a more sustainable and equitable future.

## Key Concepts and Foundational Definitions

The academic discourse surrounding digital entrepreneurship is built upon a foundation of evolving definitions and conceptual frameworks that seek to capture its unique essence. At its core, digital entrepreneurship involves the identification and exploitation of opportunities enabled by digital technologies [[14]]. Giones and Brem (2017) define it as entrepreneurial activity where individuals or teams identify and develop opportunities in the digital economy, enter digital markets, and create digital products and services [[12,14]]. This definition underscores the centrality of digital technology not merely as a tool for efficiency but as the very substrate upon which new ventures are conceived and launched. Nambisan's work further refines this perspective, emphasizing that digital technology should be viewed as an *operant resource*—an active component that actively shapes and transforms innovation processes rather than passively serving them [[4,23]]. This conceptual shift is crucial, as it reframes the entrepreneur's role from a simple user of technology to a co-creator who leverages the inherent affordances of digital platforms.

Building on these foundational ideas, scholars have proposed more structured conceptualizations. Zhu et al. (2020) developed a 5W1H conceptual system to frame digital entrepreneurship, decomposing it into six dimensions: who (the subject), why (the motivation), what (the characteristics), where (the context), when (the occasion), and how (the process) [[14]]. This provides a holistic lens for analyzing the phenomenon. Further research has deconstructed digital entrepreneurship into five core elements: digital technology itself, the abilities of the entrepreneur, the opportunities available, the resources at hand, and the digital business models employed [[14]]. This decomposition highlights the multi-faceted nature of the venture, requiring a synergy between human capital, technological capability, and organizational structure.

A particularly influential framework comes from Satalkina and Steiner (2020), who propose a systematized approach based on three primary dimensions: the **Entrepreneur**, the **Entrepreneurial Process**, and the **Ecosystem** [[3,10]]. The **Entrepreneur** dimension focuses on individual attributes such as personal attitudes, competences, knowledge, and decision-making processes [[10]]. The **Entrepreneurial Process** dimension examines how digitalization is integrated into the firm, including shifts in business models, the use of agile methodologies like the Lean Startup Approach, and the strategic application of digital affordances [[10]]. Finally, the **Ecosystem** dimension considers the external environment, encompassing the regional digital business environment, infrastructure, collaborative networks, and governance structures [[10]]. This tripartite model provides a robust analytical tool for evaluating digital entrepreneurship across different levels of analysis, from the individual founder to the macro-level institutional context.

Furthermore, the concept of digital entrepreneurship is expanding to include specialized forms that address specific societal needs. One such form is 'digital social entrepreneurship', which explicitly integrates digital technology with the principles of social entrepreneurship [[21]]. This hybrid form leverages digitization to improve the efficiency and scalability of social ventures, addressing long-standing challenges in opportunity recognition, resource acquisition, partner coordination, and impact measurement [[21]]. The proposed framework for digital social entrepreneurship includes four key elements: digital social entrepreneurs, digital social citizens, digital social entrepreneurship platforms, and digital social regulation, all operating to create mixed-value outcomes that are both social and financial [[21]]. This illustrates a broader trend where digital tools are being applied to accelerate progress on complex social issues, thereby enriching the overall contribution of the field to sustainable development. The table below summarizes some of the key definitional approaches found in the literature.

| Definition/Model | Key Contributors | Core Elements/Dimensions | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| General Definition | Giones & Brem (2017) | Opportunities created and pursued via technological platforms and ICT; combines business, knowledge, and institutional entrepreneurship. | `[[12,14]]` |
| 5W1H Conceptual System | Zhu et al. (2020) | Who, Why, What, Where, When, How; decomposed into five core elements: digital technology, abilities, opportunities, resources, business models. | `[[14]]` |
| Three-Dimensional Framework | Satalkina & Steiner (2020) | Dimensions: Entrepreneur (personal characteristics, decision-making); Entrepreneurial Process (business model innovation, digital affordances); Ecosystem (infrastructure, collaboration). | `[[3,10]]` |
| Digital Social Entrepreneurship | Liu et al. (2020) | Four elements: digital social entrepreneurs, citizens, platforms, and regulation; focuses on intelligent problem connection, real-time response, and scalable social impact. | `[[21]]` |

These diverse but complementary definitions collectively paint a picture of digital entrepreneurship as a dynamic, multi-layered phenomenon. It is simultaneously an individual act of opportunity-seeking, a process of organizational transformation driven by technology, and an outcome of supportive ecosystems. Understanding these interconnected dimensions is essential for developing effective strategies to foster not only economic growth but also positive societal and environmental change.

## Historical Development and Milestones

The trajectory of digital entrepreneurship is deeply intertwined with the rapid evolution of information and communication technologies over the past few decades. While the precise origins are difficult to pinpoint, the period since 2000 marks a distinct era of explosive growth and transformation. Early studies began to emerge, laying the groundwork for the field. For example, Cai Li et al. (2016, 2019) conducted pioneering reviews on entrepreneurial ecosystems and the impact of digital technology on entrepreneurial activities in China, signaling an early interest in the intersection of tech and entrepreneurship in emerging economies [[2]]. Around this time, Yu Jiang et al. (2018) identified digital entrepreneurship as a "new trend" in the digital age, suggesting a growing recognition of its distinct character [[2]]. However, it was the seminal work of Satish Nambisan that provided the most significant impetus for the field. His 2017 article, "Digital Entrepreneurship: Toward a Digital Technology Perspective of Entrepreneurship," published in the highly regarded *Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice*, offered a foundational theoretical framework that has since become a cornerstone of the discipline [[2,23]]. Nambisan's work emphasized the importance of digital affordances—the action possibilities that technology makes available—and generativity—the capacity of technology to spawn unanticipated innovations—as central concepts for understanding how digital platforms reshape entrepreneurial logic.

As the field matured, research expanded geographically and thematically. Scholars in China, in particular, made significant contributions to understanding the formation of digital entrepreneurial ecosystems. Studies by Du W.Y. et al. (2018) and Li W.J. et al. (2017) explored the emergence of a vibrant digital ecosystem in Zhongguancun, Beijing, one of China's premier high-tech zones [[2]]. Similarly, Zhu Xiumei et al. (2020) studied the dynamic evolution of Hangzhou Yunqi Town, another prominent hub, outlining its core elements and providing valuable case studies for understanding the mechanisms of ecosystem formation [[2,16]]. These studies highlighted the importance of local context, government support, and collaboration in nurturing clusters of digital innovation. Concurrently, international scholars contributed to the theoretical and methodological toolkit. Elia et al. (2020) focused on the role of collective intelligence within digital entrepreneurship ecosystems, arguing that shared knowledge and collaborative problem-solving are critical drivers of innovation [[2,6]]. Autio et al. (2018) examined the spatial and digital affordances that shape entrepreneurial ecosystems, adding a layer of geographical analysis to the discussion [[2]].

The historical development of the field is also marked by a growing awareness of the policy and institutional levers that can either foster or hinder digital entrepreneurship. Research from China has shown the tangible impact of e-government initiatives. For instance, the Integrated Government Service Platform (IGSP) in China was found to significantly increase entrepreneurial activity by improving administrative efficiency and reducing transaction costs [[19]]. Another study focusing on Tibet found that a national pilot policy aimed at using information to benefit the people had a significant positive effect on local entrepreneurship, underscoring the role of digital infrastructure and institutional support in enabling economic activity in less-developed regions [[20]]. These findings demonstrate that the historical progression of digital entrepreneurship cannot be understood solely through the lens of technological advancement; it must also account for the parallel evolution of governance, policy, and institutional arrangements that create an enabling environment for innovation. The journey from isolated pockets of tech-savvy individuals to globally interconnected ecosystems is a story of technology, talent, and, critically, supportive institutions coming together to unlock new frontiers of economic and social value.

## Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

The study of digital entrepreneurship has embraced a diverse array of methodological approaches, reflecting the field's interdisciplinary nature and the complexity of its subject matter. Research spans qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-method designs, each offering unique insights into different facets of the phenomenon. Qualitative methods are particularly prominent in exploratory research, where they are used to uncover the nuanced dynamics of digital ecosystems and entrepreneurial processes. For example, a study on the sharing economy within digital entrepreneurial ecosystems utilized thematic analysis of 88 open-ended interviews with business managers to develop frameworks for analyzing platform governance and user citizenship [[11]]. Similarly, another study on SMEs in Pakistan employed partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to test a hypothesized model grounded in Ecological Modernization Theory (EMT), revealing the mediating role of sustainable digital innovation in enhancing business performance [[8]]. These examples illustrate how qualitative techniques are used to build rich, contextualized theories, while quantitative methods are used to test them with empirical data.

Mixed-methods approaches are increasingly common, allowing researchers to combine the depth of qualitative insight with the breadth of quantitative analysis. A notable example is the study by Zhu et al. (2020) on the Hangzhou Yunqi Town ecosystem, which combined bibliometric analysis using CiteSpace with qualitative synthesis to identify core research themes and propose an integrated sphere model for digital entrepreneurial ecosystems [[16]]. This combination allows for a systematic mapping of the intellectual landscape of the field alongside a deep-dive analysis of specific cases. Another study adopted a quasi-experimental design, using a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach with panel data from 397 counties in China to assess the impact of a national digital governance policy on entrepreneurship [[20]]. This rigorous methodology allowed the researchers to establish a causal link between the policy intervention and increased entrepreneurial activity, demonstrating the power of quantitative methods to evaluate policy effectiveness.

In recent years, there has been a significant push towards the use of advanced computational and text-mining techniques to analyze large-scale textual data. A 2024 study on Chinese A-listed firms exemplifies this trend, employing Python for text mining of management discussion and analysis (MD&A) sections from annual reports to construct a measure of digital transformation [[9]]. This index was then used in double fixed-effects regression models estimated with Stata15 to analyze the impact on disruptive innovation, controlling for firm-specific and time-specific effects [[9]]. Such methods allow researchers to move beyond self-reported data and directly observe the language and strategic priorities of firms at a massive scale. Other computational approaches mentioned in the literature include topic modeling, which has been used to map the thematic landscape of the entire field [[5]], and machine learning techniques, which have been applied to study corporate digital transformation [[5]]. These cutting-edge methods are crucial for capturing the subtle and evolving signals of digital entrepreneurship in vast datasets.

The following table summarizes the methodological diversity found in the literature, showcasing how different techniques are tailored to answer specific research questions.

| Methodological Approach | Example Study/Application | Data Source(s) | Primary Goal | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Thematic Analysis | Analyzing sharing economy ecosystems | 88 open-ended interviews with business managers | Developing frameworks for platform governance and user behavior. | `[[11]]` |
| Partial Least Squares SEM (PLS-SEM) | Testing the impact of ecosystem components on business sustainability | Questionnaire surveys (n=431) from SMEs in Pakistan | Validating a theoretical model and testing mediation effects. | `[[8]]` |

| Abductive Reasoning & Qualitative Methods | Developing a framework for BMI in sustainability transitions | Qualitative data and abductive reasoning | Building an evolving theoretical framework grounded in empirical observations. | `[[15]]` |

This methodological pluralism is a strength of the field, allowing for a multi-faceted investigation of digital entrepreneurship. From the granular detail of individual interviews to the macro-level patterns revealed by text analysis, these diverse techniques collectively contribute to a richer and more comprehensive understanding of how digital technologies are shaping the future of innovation and enterprise.

## Applications, Case Studies, and Impact Analysis

The practical application of digital entrepreneurship is evident across a wide spectrum of industries and contexts, with numerous case studies illustrating its transformative power. In the platform economy, companies like Airbnb, Uber, TaskRabbit, and YouTube have become iconic examples of how digital technologies can dismantle traditional industry barriers and enable new forms of value creation [[11]]. These platforms function as digital infrastructure that connects providers and consumers directly, leveraging enhanced connectivity through social media and other online channels to democratize entrepreneurship [[11]]. For instance, small businesses in remote areas can now reach global markets without the need for a physical storefront, as demonstrated by the use of WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook for marketing and sales [[11]].

Beyond the well-known giants, digital entrepreneurship is also fueling innovation in more specialized domains. The synergy between Industry 4.0 technologies and the circular economy is one such area, with UK companies finding ways to use digital tools to optimize resource flows and promote reuse [[5]]. The fintech sector is another hotbed of activity, with studies exploring how digital innovations are reshaping financial services and impacting firm performance [[5]]. Even more nascent applications are emerging in areas like the metaverse, where research is beginning to explore the intersection of e-commerce and virtual worlds [[5]]. These examples show that digital entrepreneurship is not confined to a single sector but is a cross-cutting force that enables new business models and disrupts incumbents across the board.

Case studies of digital entrepreneurial ecosystems (DEEs) provide critical insights into the factors that drive success. The development of Zhongguancun in Beijing and Hangzhou Yunqi Town are frequently cited as exemplary cases of successful DEE formation in China [[2,16]]. Research on these hubs reveals the importance of several key factors: strong regional government support, the presence of incubation facilities and Living Labs, the cultivation of a supportive entrepreneurial culture, and robust collaboration networks involving universities, corporations, and investors [[2,10]]. These ecosystems accelerate the pace of innovation by facilitating knowledge mobilization, providing access to finance, and creating a fertile ground for experimentation. For example, the presence of social networks and structural holes within these ecosystems can be instrumental in connecting entrepreneurs with the right partners and resources [[10]].

The impact of digital entrepreneurship extends to the very fabric of society, with significant implications for sustainable development. A 2024 study on EU countries found a powerful correlation between the maturity of a nation's digital entrepreneurial ecosystem and its achievement of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [[17]]. The European Index of Digital Entrepreneurship Systems (EIDES), a composite metric measuring conditions for digital entrepreneurship, was found to explain 66.6% of the variance in Total SDGs, 64.3% of SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and an impressive 85.1% of SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) [[17]]. Countries with high EIDES scores, such as Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, consistently outperform nations with lower scores, like Bulgaria and Romania [[17]]. This suggests that fostering a healthy digital ecosystem is not just an economic imperative but a crucial strategy for advancing the entire sustainable development agenda. The study also identified specific barriers hindering progress in lagging countries, including low digital skills, insufficient government R&D expenditure, and restrictive regulations [[17]]. These findings underscore that the benefits of digital entrepreneurship are not automatic; they require a deliberate and holistic policy effort to build the necessary human capital, infrastructure, and institutional frameworks.

## Challenges and Open Problems

Despite its immense potential, the field of digital entrepreneurship faces a host of significant challenges and open problems that limit its full contribution to sustainable transitions. A primary obstacle lies at the level of the individual and organizational entrepreneur. Many aspiring digital entrepreneurs lack the requisite digital competences to effectively engage with the technology, turning a potential opportunity into a barrier [[10]]. This is compounded by the high cost of technology adoption and the need for extensive employee involvement and training, which can be prohibitive for smaller ventures [[12]]. Furthermore, rigid organizational structures, designed for stability in a pre-digital world, can severely slow down the adaptation process and stifle the kind of agile, iterative experimentation that is essential for digital innovation [[12]]. Trust emerges as another critical, yet often overlooked, factor. The very nature of digital platforms relies on trust among users, but this can be fragile, especially among different demographic groups, potentially affecting platform adoption and usage [[10,11]].

At the ecosystem level, the challenges are even more pronounced and systemic. A major issue is the fragmentation and lack of longitudinal research in the field, which makes it difficult to develop robust, generalizable theories about how digital entrepreneurial ecosystems evolve and succeed [[16]]. There is also a significant deficit in infrastructure, mentorship, and cultural support, particularly in rural and less-developed regions [[8]]. This creates a stark divide between "digital haves" and "have-nots," where entrepreneurs in well-resourced urban centers have vastly superior access to capital, talent, and networks compared to their counterparts elsewhere [[8,11]]. This inequality is a fundamental barrier to inclusive and equitable sustainable development. Policy instability and a lack of government support are also frequently cited as major impediments, forcing many entrepreneurs to rely on self-funding or family support, which limits scale and ambition [[8,11]].

From a methodological standpoint, the field grapples with the need for more sophisticated evaluation metrics. While established indices exist, there is a call for more comprehensive systems that can holistically assess the performance of digital entrepreneurship within national innovation systems [[3]]. The reliance on certain proxies, such as patent citations to measure disruptive innovation, may not fully capture the dynamism of software-based or service-oriented startups [[9]]. Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological change means that any static set of metrics quickly becomes outdated. The most pressing challenge, however, lies at the nexus of digital entrepreneurship and sustainability. While the potential for positive impact is clear, realizing it requires overcoming deep-seated trade-offs and paradoxes. Digitalization presents a dual-edged sword: it can empower marginalized groups and foster inclusion, but it can also exacerbate inequalities if access to technology or the necessary institutional support is lacking [[10]]. For example, while digital platforms can lower entry barriers for women and ethnic minorities, they can also perpetuate algorithmic biases and create new forms of precarious labor [[10]]. This raises a critical question: how can we design and govern digital ecosystems to maximize their pro-poor and pro-social effects while minimizing their negative consequences? Answering this question requires moving beyond simply promoting digital entrepreneurship and toward a more nuanced, critical, and ethical approach that actively works to build resilient, equitable, and truly sustainable socio-technical systems.

## Future Research Directions and Concluding Remarks

To conclude, the systematic review of the literature on digital entrepreneurship and innovation systems reveals a field that is both dynamic and fraught with potential. It has evolved from a niche interest into a central topic of inquiry for researchers in entrepreneurship, strategy, and sustainability. The evidence clearly indicates that digital entrepreneurship is not merely a subset of traditional entrepreneurship but a distinct phenomenon with its own unique drivers, processes, and challenges. Its symbiotic relationship with digital ecosystems is fundamental, as these ecosystems provide the necessary infrastructure, talent, and collaborative environment for digital ventures to thrive. Most importantly, the reviewed literature establishes a compelling link between the maturity of a nation's digital entrepreneurial ecosystem and its ability to achieve sustainable development goals, positioning digital entrepreneurship as a critical pathway toward a more sustainable future.

However, this promising trajectory is accompanied by significant open problems and research gaps that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of digital entrepreneurship for sustainable transitions. Based on the preceding analysis, several key avenues for future research emerge. First, there is a need for more longitudinal and comparative case studies of digital entrepreneurial ecosystems. While existing case studies of places like Zhongguancun and Hangzhou are insightful, a deeper, time-bound analysis would help reveal the causal mechanisms behind their success and failure, providing actionable lessons for policymakers [[16]]. Second, future research should move beyond descriptive analyses to develop and test integrative theoretical frameworks that connect the micro-level actions of entrepreneurs to meso-level ecosystem dynamics and macro-level sustainable outcomes. Integrating concepts from the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) of sustainability transitions with digital entrepreneurship theory could offer a powerful lens for analyzing how niche innovations interact with and influence incumbent regimes [[13,15]].

Third, the methodological toolbox of the field must continue to expand. More research is needed on the development and validation of robust performance indicators for digital entrepreneurship, perhaps building on existing indices like the EIDES but incorporating a stronger emphasis on social and environmental impact metrics [[3,17]]. The use of computational methods, such as AI-driven analysis of big data streams, holds promise for capturing real-time dynamics of digital ecosystems that are invisible to traditional survey methods [[5]]. Fourth, a critical area for future inquiry is the ethical dimension of digital entrepreneurship. Research must delve deeper into the dual effects of digitalization, investigating how to mitigate inequality, ensure fair labor practices on digital platforms, and prevent the concentration of power and data in the hands of a few dominant players [[10,11]]. This requires a shift from a purely efficiency-driven perspective to one that prioritizes fairness, justice, and human well-being.

In summary, the journey of digital entrepreneurship is far from complete. As digital technologies continue to permeate every aspect of society, the role of entrepreneurs in shaping our collective future will only grow in importance. The challenge for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers is to guide this transformation in a way that is not only economically profitable but also socially just and environmentally sustainable. By pursuing the research directions outlined in this review, we can better understand the forces at play and build the digital innovation systems that will underpin a prosperous and sustainable world for generations to come.
