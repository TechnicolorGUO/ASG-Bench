## Introduction and Background

International business (IB) research has long been dominated by quantitative methodologies that rely on linear, unifinal, and symmetrical assumptions about causal relationships. This approach, while powerful for identifying average effects, often leads to overly reductionist conclusions when applied to complex, interactive realities [[16]]. Phenomena such as governance choice, firm-level performance, and the success of multinational enterprises (MNEs) are inherently configurational; their outcomes emerge from specific combinations of conditions that interact in non-linear ways [[15,16]]. Recognizing this mismatch between theory and method, leading scholars have begun to advocate for a paradigm shift toward more nuanced analytical tools. In an influential 2020 editorial in the *Journal of International Business Studies* (JIBS), Stav Fainshmidt, Michael A. Witt, Ruth V. Aguilera, and Alain Verbeke argued forcefully that IB research has been slow to adopt configurational approaches, despite the field's inherent suitability for them [[16,19]]. They posited that conventional methods like multiple regression analysis fail to capture the multifaceted nature of IB phenomena, which are better understood through the lens of set-theoretic logic.

In response to this call, Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) has emerged as a prominent alternative methodology. Developed by sociologist Charles Ragin in the late 1980s, QCA was conceived as a "bridge method" to reconcile the strengths of case-based qualitative inquiry with the generalizability of variable-oriented quantitative analysis [[4,5,7]]. It is particularly suited for small-to-medium-N comparative studies (typically 10–50 cases), where it can systematically analyze the interplay of multiple, conjunctural causes [[5,13]]. By focusing on how different configurations of conditions combine to produce an outcome, QCA directly addresses the core challenges of complexity, equifinality (the idea that an outcome can be brought about by different causal pathways), and causal asymmetry (where the explanation for the presence of an outcome differs from the explanation for its absence) [[7,14]]. The JIBS editorial specifically highlighted Fuzzy-Set QCA (fsQCA) as a tool uniquely aligned with the complexities of IB contexts, capable of generating insights that are more closely attuned to the interactive realities of global business [[16]].

The purpose of this systematic literature review is to provide a comprehensive examination of QCA's contributions to international business research. We will trace the historical development of QCA, explore its key concepts and variants, and critically assess its current state-of-the-art application within IB. This review will also delve into prominent applications and case studies, identify the primary challenges and open problems confronting researchers, and outline future research directions. By synthesizing findings from foundational texts and recent empirical studies, this paper aims to serve as a definitive resource for IB scholars considering the adoption of QCA. Our objectives are to clarify the methodological underpinnings of QCA, illuminate its practical implementation, evaluate its theoretical and empirical contributions, and ultimately, foster a more rigorous and insightful application of this powerful configurational approach within the broader field of international business.

## Key Concepts and Foundational Principles

Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) is fundamentally a set-theoretic method designed to analyze causal complexity in social science research [[4,14]]. Its core philosophical orientation rests on an ontology of social and causal complexity, moving away from the linear-causal models common in mainstream quantitative research [[7]]. The central tenets of QCA include multiple and conjunctural causation, equifinality, and multifinality, reflecting the understanding that social phenomena are rarely caused by single factors but rather by intricate combinations of conditions [[7]]. Equifinality is perhaps the most distinctive principle, positing that a given outcome can be achieved through multiple, distinct causal pathways or configurations of conditions [[4,8]]. For example, high firm performance might be reached by firms that are innovative and well-capitalized, or alternatively, by those that are highly efficient and operate in protected markets. This contrasts sharply with traditional regression analysis, which assumes a single, universal effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable. Multifinality complements this by suggesting that a single condition or configuration can lead to multiple, sometimes divergent, outcomes [[7]].

A critical realist understanding of emergence is central to QCA [[7]]. This perspective holds that outcomes are not simply the sum of their parts but emerge from the specific combination of conditions. Ragin’s work emphasizes that QCA is not merely about finding correlations between variables but about identifying the necessary and sufficient configurations of conditions that lead to an outcome [[4,7]]. This configurational logic stands in contrast to covariance-based interpretations, where conditions are treated as variables whose individual effects are estimated while holding other variables constant. In QCA, the focus is on subset relations: one set (a combination of conditions) is a subset of another set (the outcome). This set-theoretic approach allows for a more holistic understanding of causation, capturing how different elements interact to produce an effect.

One of the most significant principles of QCA is causal asymmetry, which acknowledges that the causal path explaining the presence of an outcome may be different from the path explaining its absence [[4,14]]. For instance, the factors that lead an MNE subsidiary to successfully implement a stakeholder orientation (its presence) may not be the same as the factors that cause it to fail in doing so (its absence). Standard QCA procedures typically focus on analyzing either the presence or the absence of an outcome, requiring separate analyses to explore both sides of the causal equation. This unidirectionality is a limitation, as it prevents the simultaneous modeling of opposing outcomes and necessitates a clear theoretical justification for which side of the relation to investigate [[8]].

These foundational principles give rise to several key methodological advantages. First, QCA is particularly adept at handling equifinality, allowing researchers to move beyond searching for single, universal causes and instead identify the diverse pathways that lead to the same result [[8]]. Second, because it does not assume a unique causal effect for each condition, QCA is immune to omitted variable bias—a major concern in regression analysis where the exclusion of a confounding variable can distort the estimated effects of included variables [[19]]. Third, QCA accommodates causal asymmetry, providing a more nuanced view of how different sets of conditions can lead to an outcome versus how their absence leads to its non-occurrence [[14]]. Finally, QCA produces actionable, pathway-based results that are often more intuitive for practitioners and policymakers than abstract regression coefficients [[8]]. However, these strengths come with limitations. QCA does not have predictive modeling capabilities in the same way as regression [[8]], and it struggles to explain the 'how' and 'why' behind the identified configurations without being supplemented with other methods like process tracing [[13]]. Nonetheless, for researchers willing to embrace its configurational logic, QCA offers a powerful toolkit for navigating the complexity inherent in international business phenomena.

## Historical Development and Milestones in QCA Methodology

The development of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) is a story of methodological innovation aimed at bridging the gap between qualitative and quantitative research paradigms. The intellectual origins of QCA can be traced to the work of sociologist Charles C. Ragin, who introduced the method in his seminal 1987 book, *The Comparative Method: Moving Beyond Qualitative and Quantitative Strategies* [[4,5,6,7]]. In this foundational text, Ragin laid out the theoretical basis for using set-theoretic algebra and Boolean logic to analyze causal complexity in small-to-intermediate-N comparative studies [[4,18]]. His goal was to create a hybrid method that could preserve the rich case-specific detail characteristic of qualitative inquiry while achieving the systematic comparison and generalizability of quantitative analysis [[4,8]]. This initial formulation became known as Crisp-Set QCA (csQCA), which uses binary data (0 or 1) to represent membership in a set (e.g., a country has high corruption or low corruption, no fuzzy middle ground) [[4,18,19]].

While csQCA provided a powerful new tool, its reliance on dichotomous categories was seen as a significant limitation, as many social science concepts exist on a continuum rather than as discrete categories [[14]]. To address this, Ragin later extended the methodology to Fuzzy-Set QCA (fsQCA), which allows for degrees of set membership ranging from 0 (full non-membership) to 1 (full membership) [[4,14,18]]. This innovation enabled a more nuanced analysis of social phenomena, accommodating gradations like "partially corrupt," "moderately democratic," or "somewhat innovative" [[3,14]]. The development of fsQCA was a pivotal milestone, significantly broadening the range of questions that could be addressed with a configurational approach. Alongside these two main variants, Multi-Value QCA (mvQCA) was also developed to allow conditions to take on more than two values, offering another way to handle more complex categorizations [[4,5,6]]. These three variants—csQCA, fsQCA, and mvQCA—now constitute the core of the QCA family of methods [[4]].

The dissemination and standardization of QCA were greatly facilitated by a series of key publications and resources. Ragin continued to refine the methodology through works published in 2000 (*Fuzzy-Set Social Science*) and 2008 (*Redesigning Social Inquiry*) [[4,5,16,19]]. Concurrently, other scholars made crucial methodological contributions. Benoît Rihoux, for example, co-authored influential handbooks with Ragin (*Reducing Complexity*, 2009) that provided practical guidance for researchers [[6,14]]. Similarly, Claudia Schneider and Carsten Wagemann produced a comprehensive textbook (*Set-Theoretic Methods for the Social Sciences*) that established important standards of good practice [[14,19,21]]. The establishment of the COMPASSS (Comparative Methods Scholarship and Software) website further institutionalized the method, providing a hub for community news, software updates, and academic discourse [[5]].

By the mid-2010s, QCA had become firmly established in the social sciences. A 2011 article noted that there were approximately 150 empirical applications of some form of QCA at that time [[14]]. The method's growing influence is also reflected in its increasing use in top-tier management and business journals. Seminal studies began to appear, demonstrating QCA's utility in organizational settings. For instance, Kogut, MacDuffie, and Ragin (2004) used fuzzy sets to assign causal credit in strategy research, while Greckhamer et al. (2008) applied QCA to analyze industry, corporate, and business-unit effects [[17]]. More recently, the advocacy of leading IB scholars has catalyzed a surge in interest within the international business discipline itself. The 2020 JIBS editorial by Fainshmidt, Witt, Aguilera, and Verbeke served as a formal endorsement and guide for the IB community, signaling that QCA was ready to become a standard part of the IB researcher's toolkit [[16,19]]. This historical trajectory—from a niche method for comparative politics to a widely adopted technique across the social sciences and now a promising frontier for international business—highlights its enduring value in addressing complex causal questions.

## Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

The contemporary application of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in international business and related fields relies on a sophisticated methodological toolkit centered on Fuzzy-Set QCA (fsQCA) [[22]]. While all variants share the core logic of set-theoretic analysis, fsQCA is particularly favored for its ability to handle the continuous, graded data that are common in business and management research [[13,14]]. The typical fsQCA workflow involves a sequence of five key steps: defining the outcome and causal conditions, calibrating the data, constructing a truth table, minimizing the truth table via Boolean algebra, and assessing the final solution [[8,18]]. Each step is critical and requires careful consideration to ensure methodological rigor.

The first step, defining the outcome and conditions, requires clear theoretical specification. The outcome is the phenomenon to be explained (e.g., successful market entry, high absorptive capacity), while the conditions are the potential causal factors (e.g., importer opportunism, relational attractiveness) [[19,23]]. A minimum number of cases is required for the analysis, typically around 12, though this increases with the number of conditions included in the model (e.g., a model with seven conditions would ideally require around 30 cases) [[19]]. The next step, calibration, is arguably the most crucial and challenging. Calibration is the process of transforming raw data (e.g., survey scores, index values) into fuzzy-set membership scores between 0 and 1 [[14,18]]. This is not a purely statistical exercise; it requires substantive knowledge and external, theoretically informed criteria to establish the thresholds for full non-membership (0), full membership (1), and the crossover point (0.5) where ambiguity is highest [[13,14]]. For example, when calibrating a Corruption Perception Index, a score below 20 might be assigned a membership score of 0 (fully corrupt), a score above 80 might be assigned a score of 1 (fully clean), with intermediate scores assigned based on a logistic or linear transformation of the data [[19]]. The lack of standardized guidelines for this process remains a significant challenge, and transparency in justifying calibration choices is paramount for ensuring replicability [[8,13]].

Once the data are calibrated, they are used to construct a raw truth table, which lists all possible combinations of conditions and reports the frequency of cases and the level of consistency with the outcome for each row [[5,18]]. Due to limited diversity in the data (i.e., not all logical combinations of conditions are observed in reality), many rows will be logically possible but empirically empty. Researchers then apply filters to this raw table, typically setting a minimum frequency threshold (e.g., a row must contain at least three cases) and a minimum consistency threshold for outcome members (e.g., a row must have a consistency of at least 0.75) [[19,23]]. This cleaned truth table is then submitted to a minimization algorithm, most commonly the Quine-McCluskey algorithm, which simplifies the complex logical expression to identify the simplest set of sufficient configurations for the outcome [[4,18]].

The output of this process is a solution, which can be presented in various forms. The most parsimonious solution includes the fewest possible conditions, representing the most generalizable but potentially less realistic configurations. At the other end of the spectrum is the conservative solution, which only includes terms found directly in the data, making it highly realistic but less generalizable. Most researchers report an intermediate or complex solution, which strikes a balance between these two extremes [[2]]. The quality of the solution is assessed using two primary parameters: consistency and coverage [[4,8]]. Consistency measures the degree to which a configuration is a sufficient cause for the outcome (analogous to internal validity); a common benchmark is a consistency score of 0.75 or higher [[19]]. Coverage measures the proportion of the outcome that is explained by a particular configuration (analogous to explanatory power or external validity); high coverage indicates that the configuration accounts for a substantial portion of the cases with the outcome [[8,10]]. An additional parameter, the Proportional Reduction in Inconsistency (PRI), is often used to assess the contribution of a solution to overall model fit [[19]]. To enhance robustness, analysts should conduct sensitivity analyses by varying calibration anchors and consistency/frequency thresholds to test the stability of their results [[23]]. Furthermore, advancements like Panel Data QCA (pdQCA) now enable the analysis of time-varying cases, although this extension has its own limitations regarding the capture of qualitative change over time [[24]].

## Applications and Case Studies in International Business Research

Since its introduction to the field, Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) has been increasingly applied to a wide array of topics within international business, offering novel insights into phenomena that are inherently configurational. The method has proven particularly useful for studying governance choices, firm performance, and the impact of institutional environments on multinational enterprises (MNEs). A review of the literature reveals a growing body of work that demonstrates QCA's capacity to generate hypotheses about complex causal pathways, resolve conflicting findings in the literature, and facilitate multi-level analysis.

One of the most prominent areas of application has been in examining the drivers of firm-level performance and strategic choices. For example, a study by Bell et al. (2014) used fsQCA to investigate the governance structures of foreign IPOs in the U.S. market, identifying six distinct configurations of ownership, board structure, and legal origin that supported the achievement of "nested legitimacy" [[19]]. Similarly, Verbeke et al. (2018) analyzed 133 market entries by 38 Chinese exporters and identified five distinct configurations of importer opportunism that led to different outcomes, highlighting the contextual nature of trade relationships [[19]]. Another study on absorptive capacity and innovation found a configuration of strong prior relatedness and proactive market monitoring to be sufficient for high innovation, with a coverage of 0.82, indicating that this pathway explains a large portion of the observed variance [[12]].

QCA has also been instrumental in exploring the role of institutions and context in shaping firm behavior. Pajunen (2008) conducted a cross-country analysis of FDI attractiveness across 47 nations, finding that countries were attractive to investors due to multiple institutional configurations, including low corruption and strong property rights protections, even in less developed economies [[19]]. Witt and Jackson (2016) studied institutional comparative advantage across 14 industries in 22 countries, introducing the concept of "beneficial constraints"—institutional arrangements that, paradoxically, foster competitiveness [[19]]. In the realm of supply chain management, which is central to IB, QCA has been used to understand disruptions. One study identified several sufficient configurations involving supplier characteristics, buyer-supplier relationship dynamics, and contingency planning that helped firms respond effectively to supplier-induced disruptions [[1]]. Even within the broader field of health services research, which shares many concerns with IB, QCA has been used to identify distinct pathways to achieving high-quality care in safety net hospitals, demonstrating the method's interdisciplinary relevance [[8]].

The following table provides a summary of selected applications of QCA in international business and management research, illustrating the diversity of topics and configurations explored.

| Study Focus | Authors / Year | IB Subfield | Number of Cases | Outcome Variable | Key Findings / Sufficient Configurations | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FDI Attractiveness** | Pajunen (2008) | International Investment | 47 Countries | FDI Attractiveness | Non-corruptness and strong property rights protection were found to be sufficient conditions for FDI attraction, particularly in less developed countries. | `[[19]]` |
| **Stakeholder Orientation** | Crilly (2011) | MNE Strategy | 52 Subsidiaries | Stakeholder Orientation | Successful stakeholder orientation was achieved through configurations combining subsidiary autonomy with embeddedness in the local network. | `[[19]]` |
| **Foreign IPO Governance** | Bell et al. (2014) | International Finance | 198 Firms from 36 Countries | Nested Legitimacy | Six distinct governance configurations (e.g., dual-class shares + strong board oversight) were found to be sufficient for gaining legitimacy in the U.S. market. | `[[19]]` |
| **Market Entry Success** | Verbeke et al. (2018) | International Business | 133 Market Entries by 38 Chinese firms | Importer Opportunism Outcomes | Five different configurations of importer opportunism were identified, showing that context matters significantly in managing trade risks. | `[[19]]` |
| **Absorptive Capacity & Innovation** | Unspecified (2016) | Strategic Management | Not Available | High Innovation | A configuration combining strong prior relatedness with proactive market monitoring was found to be sufficient for high innovation (Coverage: 0.82, Consistency: 0.75). | `[[12]]` |
| **Outsourcing Effects** | Unspecified (2013) | Operations Management | Not Available | Outsourcing Performance | Several sufficient configurations were identified, highlighting the importance of complementary capabilities and governance mechanisms. | `[[12]]` |
| **PPPs in Infrastructure** | Unspecified (2015) | Project Management | Not Available | PPP Success | The study identified configurations of public-private partnership features that led to successful project delivery. | `[[12]]` |

These examples demonstrate that QCA provides a structured yet flexible framework for exploring the complex interplay of factors that shape international business outcomes. By identifying multiple, equifinal pathways, QCA moves beyond simplistic cause-and-effect relationships to reveal the nuanced and contingent nature of global business strategies and performance.

## Challenges and Open Problems in QCA Application

Despite its growing popularity and demonstrated utility, the application of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in international business research is fraught with significant challenges and open problems that demand careful attention from researchers. These issues span the entire research process, from conceptualization and data collection to analysis and interpretation. Acknowledging and addressing these problems is essential for advancing the method's credibility and rigor within the IB discipline.

One of the most persistent and widely discussed challenges is the subjectivity inherent in the calibration process, particularly in fsQCA [[4,13]]. Calibration requires researchers to make judgment calls about where to place the thresholds for full inclusion, full exclusion, and the crossover point on a fuzzy scale [[14,18]]. These decisions are meant to be guided by substantive knowledge and external standards, but the lack of universally agreed-upon rules means that different researchers could reasonably arrive at different calibrations for the same concept [[13]]. This raises legitimate concerns about confirmation bias, where a researcher might unconsciously adjust calibration points to support a preconceived hypothesis, and undermines the replicability of the analysis [[13]]. While transparency in documenting the rationale for calibration choices is a recommended safeguard, the underlying issue of subjective interpretation remains a central weakness of the method [[8,13]].

A second major challenge is the problem of limited diversity. QCA relies on the available variation in the dataset to build its truth table [[10]]. When the number of conditions in a model grows, the number of logically possible configurations expands exponentially (2^k, where k is the number of conditions), and it becomes increasingly likely that many of these combinations will not be represented in the data [[19]]. This leads to "logical counterfactuals"—assumptions about what the outcome would be for unobserved configurations—which can heavily influence the final solution [[4,14]]. Different assumptions about these counterfactuals can yield dramatically different results, making the solutions sensitive to methodological choices. This problem is compounded by contradictory configurations, where the same combination of conditions appears in the data with both the outcome present and absent, complicating the identification of clear, sufficient pathways [[4]].

Furthermore, QCA is not without its limitations regarding sample size and scope. Although Ragin originally advocated for its use in small-N studies (as few as four to eight cases), the method is now frequently applied to larger datasets [[13]]. However, applying QCA to large-N studies (e.g., over 100 cases) creates a dilemma. On one hand, the richness of case knowledge that is a hallmark of QCA can be difficult to maintain and accurately operationalize across hundreds of cases, a phenomenon referred to as "method stretching" [[13]]. On the other hand, the sheer volume of data can obscure the very nuances that QCA is designed to uncover. This tension highlights a need for clearer guidelines on the optimal N-size for different types of QCA analyses and for innovative approaches to collaborative calibration that do not compromise rigor [[13]].

Finally, a recurring critique is that QCA, in its standard form, struggles to fully account for temporal dynamics and process. As a static method, it captures a snapshot in time and cannot easily model how causal relationships evolve or how path dependencies shape outcomes [[13,24]]. Temporal extensions like Temporal QCA (TQCA) and Panel Data QCA (pdQCA) have been developed to incorporate time, but they are often limited in their ability to capture complex path dependencies and qualitative changes over time [[13,24]]. This limitation means that QCA often needs to be supplemented with other methods, such as process tracing, to explain the 'how' and 'why' behind the identified configurations [[7,13]]. Without this supplementation, QCA can provide answers to the question "what" leads to an outcome but remain silent on the mechanisms driving it.

## Future Research Directions and Conclusion

To conclude, Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) represents a significant methodological advance for international business (IB) research, offering a powerful framework for investigating the complex, interactive, and configurational nature of global business phenomena. This systematic review has traced the evolution of QCA from its origins in sociology to its current status as a vital tool in the social sciences, with a particular emphasis on its growing, albeit nascent, application in IB. By embracing principles like equifinality, multiple conjunctural causation, and set-theoretic logic, QCA provides a compelling alternative to traditional linear models that have historically dominated the field [[15,16]]. The evidence shows that QCA can successfully identify multiple, equifinal pathways to outcomes such as firm performance, successful market entry, and effective governance, thereby enriching our understanding of how and why certain strategies succeed in some contexts but fail in others [[12,19]].

However, for QCA to realize its full potential in IB, several critical avenues for future research must be pursued. The first priority is to enhance methodological rigor and transparency. Addressing the challenges of calibration subjectivity requires the development of more explicit and defensible guidelines, possibly leveraging algorithmic methods or consensus-building techniques among expert panels to supplement individual judgment [[13,19]]. Similarly, tackling the problem of limited diversity demands greater creativity in sampling and case selection to maximize the available variation, alongside more sophisticated sensitivity analyses that explicitly probe the robustness of solutions to different counterfactual assumptions [[4,10]].

Second, there is a pressing need to integrate QCA with other qualitative and process-oriented methods. The inherent difficulty of explaining the 'how' and 'why' behind set-theoretic relationships makes a combinatory approach essential [[7,13]]. Future IB research should champion the use of QCA in conjunction with process tracing, comparative historical analysis, or in-depth case studies to unpack the mechanisms that link configurations to outcomes [[24]]. This mixed-methods approach will not only strengthen the explanatory power of QCA but also align with the tradition of deep case-based inquiry that is valued in IB scholarship.

Third, future work should focus on developing and validating more advanced QCA techniques tailored to the specific needs of IB research. While existing temporal extensions like TQCA and pdQCA are a step in the right direction, they are not yet sophisticated enough to capture the full complexity of dynamic processes in IB [[13,24]]. Developing methods that can better model path dependency, feedback loops, and qualitative change over time would be a transformative contribution. Additionally, refining the conceptualization of key IB constructs (e.g., ownership control, relational capital) to better suit a set-theoretic approach is needed to improve the quality of the input data [[19]].

In summary, the journey of QCA in international business is just beginning. The method's alignment with the core ontological assumptions of IB—complexity, contingency, and interaction—is undeniable. The path forward requires a concerted effort from the IB research community to engage deeply with the method's philosophical foundations, confront its inherent challenges with creative solutions, and strategically deploy it in combination with other approaches to build a more nuanced and realistic understanding of the world of global business. By doing so, IB scholars can leverage QCA to generate insights that are not only statistically sound but also theoretically profound and practically relevant.
