## Introduction: The Pivotal Role and Persistent Vulnerability of SMEs

Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) represent the economic backbone of nations worldwide, yet their path to survival and growth is fraught with persistent challenges. Despite their critical importance, these enterprises are often characterized by a paradoxical duality: they are simultaneously engines of innovation and employment, and highly vulnerable actors in an increasingly complex global economy. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the key challenges confronting SMEs globally and the multifaceted strategies they employ to navigate these adversities. The motivation for this research stems from the fundamental tension between the indispensable role SMEs play in economic development and their inherent susceptibility to external shocks, resource constraints, and systemic barriers. Understanding this dynamic is not merely an academic exercise; it is essential for policymakers, financial institutions, and business leaders seeking to foster resilient and sustainable economies. The primary objective of this paper is to synthesize existing literature on SME resilience, identify recurring themes and critical gaps, and chart a course for future inquiry that can better equip these vital organizations for the challenges ahead.

The significance of SMEs cannot be overstated. Across both developed and developing nations, they are the primary generators of jobs and value-added output [[15]]. In the United States, for instance, SMEs constitute 99.7% of all employer firms, generating nearly half of the country's private sector employment and contributing 44% of its economic activity [[7]]. Similarly, in Canada, SMEs accounted for 97.9% of all employer businesses in 2023 and employed over 62% of the workforce [[9]]. In the European Union, where they form the bedrock of the economy, SMEs represent 99% of all businesses, employ approximately 100 million people, and generate over half of the region's GDP [[8,12]]. This dominance extends to developing countries as well, where the informal or formal SME sector contributes up to 50% of total employment and 40% of GDP [[9]]. Beyond their sheer numbers, SMEs are recognized as crucial drivers of innovation, entrepreneurship, and social inclusion. They are often more agile and adaptable than large corporations, enabling them to respond quickly to market changes and consumer needs. Furthermore, they are disproportionately responsible for job creation during periods of economic recovery, as evidenced by their significant contribution to growth following the 2007-08 Global Financial Crisis [[7]].

Despite this foundational role, SMEs face a formidable array of challenges that threaten their viability. These challenges range from intense competition with multinational corporations (MNCs) to severe financial constraints and operational vulnerabilities [[2]]. Their very size, which allows for flexibility, also imposes limitations on access to capital, technology, and skilled human resources [[6]]. This vulnerability was starkly illuminated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the temporary cessation of trading for 36% of UK-based SMEs and a reported 40% decline in US employment within affected businesses [[5,6]]. The subsequent need for massive government intervention, such as the $2 trillion US CARES Act and a €500 billion EU fund, underscores the systemic risk posed when SMEs falter [[7]]. This context highlights the core tension at the heart of SME research: how can societies harness the immense potential of these small players while mitigating their profound weaknesses? Answering this question requires a deep understanding of the specific hurdles they face and the innovative strategies they deploy to overcome them. This review aims to provide that understanding, synthesizing findings from a wide body of literature to illuminate the complex reality of SME survival in the modern world.

## Key Concepts and Defining Characteristics of SMEs

A precise understanding of what constitutes a Small and Medium-sized Enterprise is fundamental to any discussion of their challenges and strategies. However, the definition of an SME is not universal; it is a fluid concept that varies significantly across different jurisdictions, industries, and analytical frameworks. These variations reflect the diverse contexts in which SMEs operate and the differing policy objectives of governments seeking to support them. At a high level, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines SMEs as organizations employing fewer than 250 people [[7]]. This broad definition serves as a useful starting point but masks considerable complexity. For example, in the United States, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) employs industry-specific criteria, classifying a firm as small based on metrics like revenue or number of employees that differ by sector—for instance, a manufacturing firm might be considered small if it has 500 or fewer employees, whereas a hospitality firm could have many more [[9]]. In Canada, SMEs are categorized by employee count into micro businesses (1–4 employees), small (5–99), and medium (100–499) enterprises [[9]].

The European Union presents one of the most detailed and widely referenced classification systems. According to its 2003 Recommendation 2003/361, an enterprise is classified based on individual thresholds for staff headcount, annual turnover, or balance sheet total [[8]]. Micro enterprises have fewer than 10 employees and either a turnover or balance sheet total below €2 million. Small enterprises have fewer than 50 employees and a turnover or balance sheet total below €10 million. Medium-sized enterprises fall under the category of having fewer than 250 employees and a turnover or balance sheet total below €50 million / €43 million, respectively [[8]]. It is important to note that these thresholds apply individually, though group data may be included if the SME is part of a larger corporate structure [[8]]. Recognizing the challenges associated with "cliff-edge" effects when SMEs cross these arbitrary boundaries, the EU is currently introducing a new category, the Small Mid-Cap (SMC), to ease compliance burdens [[8]]. This evolving nature of definitions highlights the ongoing effort to create policies that are both practical and effective.

Beyond these quantitative definitions, a critical insight emerging from recent research is the immense heterogeneity that exists within the broad SME category [[1,16,17]]. An SME operating in the high-tech ICT sector faces vastly different challenges and opportunities compared to a family-owned manufacturing firm or a sole trader in the service sector. This internal diversity makes the development of one-size-fits-all policies and generic survival strategies problematic. Acknowledging this, the OECD has undertaken significant work to develop more nuanced typologies for SMEs and entrepreneurship, analyzing 169 different classification systems to propose actionable frameworks for policymakers [[1,16,17]]. This push towards greater granularity reflects a growing recognition that effective support must be tailored to the specific context of the enterprise. For instance, a strategy focused on R&D grants may be appropriate for a knowledge-intensive scaler, but irrelevant for a traditional retail SME struggling with cash flow. Therefore, any comprehensive review of SME challenges and survival strategies must begin by appreciating the definitional ambiguity and the underlying heterogeneity that shapes every aspect of their experience.

## The Landscape of Global Challenges Facing SMEs

SMEs operate in a landscape rife with multifaceted challenges that can be broadly categorized into exogenous shocks, structural limitations, and environmental pressures. These challenges are not isolated incidents but interconnected forces that collectively strain the capacity of SMEs to survive and thrive. The most frequently cited challenge is intense market competition, particularly from large multinational corporations (MNCs) and transnational corporations (TNCs) [[2]]. These larger entities possess significant advantages in financial resources, brand recognition, and operational scale, which often place smaller competitors at a distinct disadvantage [[2]]. This competitive pressure is exacerbated by economic globalization, which enables MNCs to optimize production costs by leveraging specialized knowledge and lower labor costs in regions like China and India, further marginalizing local SMEs [[2]]. The resulting market dynamics force SMEs into a precarious position, compelling them to seek alternative pathways to remain relevant.

In response to this competitive threat, many SMEs pursue internationalization by integrating into global value chains (GVCs) as suppliers of components or services to MNCs [[2]]. This strategy offers tangible benefits, including access to technical assistance, management expertise, and new markets. However, it is not without risks; the knowledge transfer from MNCs is not always reciprocal, leaving the SMEs dependent on their larger partners and potentially locked into low-margin segments of the value chain [[2]]. Furthermore, engaging in global operations introduces a host of other challenges. SMEs often lack the necessary resources, technical skills, foreign market knowledge, and established international networks required to initiate and sustain global activities [[2]]. This leads to difficulties in areas ranging from logistics and marketing to navigating complex international regulations.

Beyond market dynamics, SMEs are acutely vulnerable to macroeconomic instability. Economic crises, such as the 2007-08 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the COVID-19 pandemic, have had devastating impacts. During the GFC, a majority of crisis-focused research centered on Europe [[7]]. The COVID-19 pandemic served as another powerful exogenous shock, forcing widespread business closures and drastic reductions in employment and revenue [[4,6]]. Crises are broadly categorized into exogenous events (e.g., pandemics, natural disasters, armed conflict) and endogenous shocks (e.g., production failure, internal errors) [[6]]. The impact of these crises is often mediated by pre-existing structural limitations. Chief among these are firm size-related constraints, which manifest as limited access to capital, restrictive debt burdens, and ineffective leadership [[6]]. This creates a vicious cycle where resource scarcity prevents investment in growth-oriented capabilities, which in turn perpetuates the firm's vulnerability.

Finally, SMEs must contend with a complex web of environmental factors. Access to finance remains a perennial issue, with bank financing often being difficult to secure due to perceived risk, even when owner-managers rely on household wealth or loans at high interest rates [[12]]. The regulatory environment can also present significant hurdles, although standards themselves can be leveraged as tools for development [[14]]. Developing countries, in particular, face a trade-off between premature standardization, which can lock them into suboptimal practices, and delayed implementation, which reduces developmental benefits [[14]]. Collectively, these challenges paint a picture of SMEs as highly sensitive organisms in a turbulent ecosystem. Their ability to survive depends not just on their own internal strengths but on their capacity to navigate this intricate interplay of competitive, economic, and environmental pressures.

## Core Survival Strategies: From Internal Capabilities to External Collaborations

In response to the daunting challenges they face, SMEs deploy a diverse arsenal of survival strategies that span internal organizational capabilities and external collaborative arrangements. These strategies are not mutually exclusive and are often used in combination to build a multi-layered defense against adversity. The literature consistently identifies several principal coping mechanisms that enable SMEs to anticipate, cope with, and recover from crises [[6]]. These strategies can be grouped into four main categories: enhancing internal characteristics, adopting technology, fostering strategic collaborations, and securing external financial support.

Internally, the cultivation of specific firm-level characteristics is paramount for building resilience. Key dimensions include strong leadership, adaptability, and a positive organizational culture [[6]]. Owner-managers play a central role in decision-making, and their personal qualities—such as experience, perception, and entrepreneurial mindset—significantly influence firm performance and resilience [[6,12]]. Research shows that young firms (those under five years old) exhibit a higher probability of becoming "scalers" (firms growing at ≥10% annually) compared to more mature firms, suggesting that youthful dynamism can be a key asset [[13]]. Furthermore, a proactive organizational culture that embraces innovation and continuous training of human resources is identified as a critical success factor [[12]]. These internal attributes allow firms to sense risks, absorb pressure, and protect their capital and reputation during turbulent times [[4]]. The adoption of business continuity plans is also highlighted as a crucial preparation strategy [[6]].

Technological adoption represents a cornerstone of modern SME survival strategies. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is emphasized as a particularly cost-effective tool that can help level the playing field against larger competitors [[2]]. By leveraging e-commerce and m-commerce platforms, SMEs can establish relationships with foreign vendors, engage in internet marketing, reduce communication costs, and enhance overall transaction efficiency [[2]]. This digital transformation is not merely about online sales; it involves using cloud computing, information systems, and big data analytics to improve resource utilization and operational effectiveness [[2,15]]. The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a major catalyst for this shift, forcing many SMEs to rapidly adopt digital tools for remote work and customer engagement [[2]]. However, the transition is fraught with obstacles, especially in developing nations where shortages of ICT skills, limited finance, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities hinder progress [[2]]. Despite these barriers, SMEs in digital-intensive sectors demonstrated greater resilience during the pandemic, underscoring the long-term strategic importance of technology [[10]].

Collaboration with external partners is another vital strategy for overcoming resource constraints and expanding market reach. Strategic collaborations take various forms, including clustering with other firms, forming partnerships with government bodies, and engaging in open innovation models [[4,6]]. Networking, in particular, is shown to be a powerful mechanism for exchanging resources, reducing risk, building trust, and fostering innovation [[2]]. Competitiveness, in many cases, depends more on the efficiency of a firm's network than on its absolute size [[2]]. Open Innovation, the practice of sourcing ideas and technologies from outside the firm, has been identified as a transformative capability for SMEs navigating crises [[4]]. By collaborating with universities, research institutions, or other companies, SMEs can access knowledge and resources they cannot develop internally. This approach is supported by theories like Dynamic Capabilities, which emphasize the need for firms to manage and reconfigure knowledge to adapt to high-velocity markets [[4]]. Finally, proactive supply chain management, such as diversification, and product modification are also cited as effective strategies to mitigate disruptions [[6]]. Together, these internal and external strategies form a comprehensive toolkit that SMEs use to navigate a perilous global environment.

## The Critical Interplay of Finance, Policy, and Resilience

Financial stability and supportive public policy are arguably the most critical pillars for SME survival and growth. The provision of capital is consistently identified as the single most common instrument in government policy portfolios aimed at supporting SMEs, accounting for 46% of interventions and 47% of those designed to improve internal capacity [[10,13]]. Access to finance is a chronic problem for SMEs, stemming from their limited collateral, uncertain cash flows, and higher perceived risk profiles, which often lead to restricted credit from banks [[2,6]]. This "strategy/funding chicken-and-egg problem," where resource constraints prevent the execution of growth-oriented strategies, highlights the foundational nature of financial health [[7]]. When conventional bank financing tightens, as it did during the GFC and the COVID-19 pandemic, alternative sources become vital. Trade credit, for instance, becomes a critical lifeline for financially vulnerable SMEs [[7]].

Recognizing this vulnerability, governments around the world have implemented a wide array of financial support measures. These range from direct funding instruments to market-enhancing policies. Direct support typically takes the form of grants, loans, and loan guarantees. For example, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers programs like the 7(a) loan program, which provides partial guarantees to lenders, and microloans of up to $50,000 [[9]]. During the COVID-19 crisis, governments enacted unprecedented stimulus packages, including the U.S. CARES Act and a €500 billion EU fund, which incorporated extensive financial support for SMEs [[7]]. In Japan, credit guarantee schemes were instrumental in providing relief [[7]]. Qualitative studies have shown that local grant funding (LGF) can have a significant positive effect on SME resilience, enabling crucial activities like recapitalization, business continuity, and innovation during a crisis [[5]]. One video equipment hire company, aided by grants and new contracts, saw its revenue surge from £300k to £3.4 million post-pandemic, demonstrating the transformative potential of targeted financial aid [[5]].

However, the evidence base suggests that not all policy instruments are equally effective. A meta-evaluation of 50 reliable policy evaluations across 28 OECD countries found more consistent positive impacts from policies that improved access to finance compared to those focused on training and advisory services [[11]]. The effectiveness of these policies is highly dependent on their targeting and delivery methods, with mixed results reported overall [[11]]. There is a clear trend towards targeted interventions, with 60% of SME policies targeting specific populations, sectors, or technologies [[13]]. About 30% of these targeted policies specifically focus on artificial intelligence, reflecting the shifting priorities of policymakers [[13]]. This move towards precision targeting acknowledges the heterogeneity of SMEs and the need for tailored solutions.

Beyond direct financial support, policies that improve the broader business environment are also crucial. These include initiatives to enhance data governance, expand innovation networks, and improve skills [[10]]. Venture capital instruments, while less common, are used in 11% of innovation-focused policies [[13]]. Furthermore, the process of standard-setting itself has emerged as a critical area for policy intervention, especially for developing countries [[14]]. Adopting international standards can boost productivity and facilitate trade, while participating in the authoring of new standards can provide a strategic advantage [[14]]. The World Development Report 2025 emphasizes that the timing, scope, and stringency of standardization efforts are critical levers for development [[14]]. In essence, the financial and policy landscape for SMEs is a complex ecosystem of direct aid, market reforms, and strategic guidance. The optimal configuration of these elements is still being refined, but the consensus is clear: robust and well-designed financial and policy support is indispensable for translating the latent potential of SMEs into sustained economic reality.

## Synthesis and Future Trajectories: Identifying Research Gaps and Opportunities

In synthesizing the vast and varied literature on SME challenges and survival strategies, several overarching themes emerge, alongside critical gaps that define the frontier of current research. The collective body of work paints a clear picture of SMEs as highly heterogeneous actors facing a confluence of exogenous shocks and endogenous weaknesses. The most salient finding is the centrality of resilience—a firm's ability to anticipate, cope with, and recover from adverse events—as the ultimate goal of survival [[4,6]]. This resilience is not an innate quality but is built through a dynamic interplay of internal capabilities, technological adoption, and strategic external collaborations. Resource-based view (RBV), dynamic capabilities, and open innovation have emerged as dominant theoretical frameworks for understanding how firms leverage their assets to navigate crises [[3,4,12]]. Methodologically, the field has predominantly relied on quantitative approaches, particularly Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and regression analysis, to test these theoretical propositions [[3,15]].

Despite this progress, significant research gaps remain, pointing toward promising future trajectories. One of the most glaring omissions is the relative lack of research on non-economic crises. While the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred much valuable work, there is a need for more systematic study of other types of shocks, such as war, terrorism, and climate-related disasters, to understand their unique impact on SMEs and the distinct survival strategies they necessitate [[3]]. Another critical gap lies in the underrepresentation of certain firm types in the academic literature. Family firms and startups are notably absent from many crisis studies, despite evidence suggesting their behavioral differences may warrant separate investigation [[7]]. Similarly, the "strategy/funding chicken-and-egg problem" identified by some researchers points to a need for more longitudinal and dynamic analyses that explore the interplay between strategic choices and financial constraints over time, rather than static snapshots [[3,7]].

Future research should also deepen its focus on the individual and organizational characteristics that drive resilience. There is a call for more inclusive studies on the role of the entrepreneur's personality, mindset, and entrepreneurial orientation in shaping firm outcomes during crises [[6,7]]. The concept of effectuation, which proposes a logic for entrepreneurs operating under extreme uncertainty, is suggested as a particularly promising framework for future inquiry [[7]]. Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of resilience merit more attention. Most studies focus on immediate responses and short-to-medium term rebounds, but the long-term legacy of major economic crises, such as the GFC or the pandemic, on surviving SMEs' growth trajectories, market positioning, and operational models remains poorly understood [[6]].

To conclude, the literature provides a robust foundation for understanding the challenges and strategies of SMEs. It demonstrates that survival is contingent upon a firm's ability to cultivate intangible assets like adaptability and strong networks, embrace technology, and leverage external support effectively. However, the field is ripe for evolution. Future research must move beyond generalizations to embrace the heterogeneity of SMEs by focusing on specific sectors, firm types, and crisis contexts. By pursuing more dynamic, longitudinal, and inclusive studies, researchers can provide the nuanced insights needed to design more effective, targeted policies and support systems. Ultimately, closing these research gaps will be essential for unlocking the full potential of SMEs as engines of innovation, employment, and inclusive economic growth in an increasingly uncertain world.
