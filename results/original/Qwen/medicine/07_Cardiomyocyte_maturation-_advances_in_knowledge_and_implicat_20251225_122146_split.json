      "content": "The heart possesses a limited capacity for self-renewal, particularly in adult mammals. Following injury, such as a myocardial infarction, the damaged tissue is typically replaced by non-contractile scar tissue, leading to progressive heart failure and significant morbidity and mortality. This clinical reality has driven intense research into regenerative medicine as a potential therapeutic strategy to restore cardiac function. A central pillar of this endeavor is the use of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which can be differentiated into cardiomyocytes (CMs). The goal is to generate a limitless supply of functional CMs for cell-based therapies, disease modeling, and drug discovery. However, a fundamental and persistent challenge has been that PSC-derived CMs exhibit a phenotype that is developmentally immature, resembling early fetal rather than adult cardiac muscle [[3,12]]. This \"fetal-like\" state manifests across multiple biological scales, from structural organization to metabolic machinery and electrophysiological properties, creating a significant barrier to their effective use in both research and clinical applications.\n\nThe importance of achieving mature cardiomyocytes cannot be overstated. In the context of cell therapy for heart disease, immature CMs are at high risk of arrhythmogenesis upon transplantation due to their unstable resting membrane potential and lack of organized electrical coupling with the host myocardium [[10]]. Furthermore, they often fail to survive, engraft, or integrate functionally within the adult heart, limiting their ability to contribute to contractile force and remuscularize scar tissue [[1,13]]. For disease modeling and drug testing, the immaturity of these cells means they may not accurately reflect the pathophysiology of adult-onset diseases or predict drug responses in a clinically relevant manner. Consequently, the field of cardiac regeneration has increasingly shifted its focus from simply generating CMs to developing robust methods for maturing them *in vitro* to an adult-like state. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the current understanding of cardiomyocyte maturation, detailing the defining characteristics of maturity, the historical evolution of maturation strategies, the state-of-the-art techniques being used today, their applications, and the significant challenges that remain. By synthesizing recent findings on genetic, epigenetic, and environmental regulators, this report aims to provide a critical overview of the field's progress and chart a course toward realizing the full potential of regenerative medicine for cardiovascular disease."

      "heading": "Key Concepts and Defining Hallmarks of Cardiomyocyte Maturity",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Cardiomyocyte maturation is a complex, multi-stage process involving profound changes in structure, metabolism, and electrophysiology. Understanding these hallmarks is crucial for developing and assessing maturation protocols. Pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs) typically arrest at an early developmental stage, necessitating targeted interventions to guide them toward a fully mature phenotype [[3]]. The differences between immature PSC-CMs and adult ventricular myocytes are stark and pervasive across all cellular systems.\n\nStructurally, mature cardiomyocytes are characterized by a distinct rod-like morphology, with a length-to-width ratio of 5:1 to 9:1, which facilitates uniaxial contraction [[9]]. They possess highly organized sarcomeres, the basic contractile units of muscle, featuring well-defined I-bands, A-bands, H-zones, and Z-disks. A key feature of maturation is the formation of a central M-line and the alignment of sarcomeres along the longitudinal axis of the cell [[3,6]]. The average sarcomere length increases significantly, reaching approximately 2.2 μm in humans, compared to around 1.5-1.7 μm in immature PSC-CMs [[1,5]]. This structural reorganization is accompanied by an increase in cell size through a process known as maturational hypertrophy, resulting in a cell volume increase of over 30-fold [[1]]. In contrast, PSC-CMs are typically round and single-nucleated, lacking the striated appearance and elongated shape of their adult counterparts [[3]].\n\nA critical aspect of structural maturation is the development of the transverse-tubule (T-tubule) system, a network of invaginations of the sarcolemma that allows for rapid propagation of the action potential deep into the cell interior. This ensures synchronized calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via ryanodine receptors (RyR2), facilitating efficient excitation-contraction coupling [[3,6]]. Immature PSC-CMs generally lack a developed T-tubule network, contributing to their poor contractile efficiency [[3]]. Another hallmark is the formation of intercalated discs, specialized junctions that mediate mechanical adhesion and direct electrical coupling between adjacent cells. These discs contain fascia adherens junctions with N-cadherin and desmosomes for strong adhesion, and gap junctions composed primarily of connexin-43 (Cx43) for fast electrical propagation [[3,6]]. Mature myocytes also become binucleated, with this percentage increasing to over 80% in rodents and approximately 25% in humans, a transition linked to the exit from the cell cycle and the onset of terminal differentiation [[1]].\n\nMetabolically, adult cardiomyocytes have a high energy demand and are almost exclusively reliant on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for ATP production, primarily fueled by fatty acid oxidation (FAO) [[2,8]]. This shift from glycolysis during late gestation and early postnatal life requires a substantial expansion of the mitochondrial network. Mitochondria occupy up to 35-40% of the adult cardiomyocyte volume, forming dense cristae structures essential for efficient OXPHOS [[1,6]]. In stark contrast, immature PSC-CMs rely heavily on glycolysis, possess few and underdeveloped mitochondria that occupy only about 10-15% of the cell volume, and lack organized cristae [[2,3]]. Metabolic maturation involves a coordinated upregulation of genes involved in FAO, pantothenate metabolism, and Coenzyme A synthesis [[8]]. It is marked by the expression of specific isoforms of metabolic enzymes, such as switching from GLUT1 to insulin-dependent GLUT4 for glucose uptake and from CD36-mediated glycolysis to CD36-mediated fatty acid uptake [[2]].\n\nElectrophysiologically, the resting membrane potential (RMP) becomes more negative, reaching approximately -85 mV in adults, a change driven by increased expression of inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir2.1/Kir2.2 encoded by *KCNJ12/KCNJ2*) and downregulation of pacemaker currents mediated by HCN4 channels [[6,9]]. This stabilizes the membrane potential and prevents spontaneous automaticity. Action potentials in mature ventricular myocytes are characterized by a prominent plateau phase, which is generated by the balance of L-type calcium current (*SCN5A*) and delayed rectifier potassium currents. Immature cells lack this plateau and exhibit faster maximum upstroke velocities due to higher sodium current density but show less stability [[1,5]]. Calcium handling is also refined; mature cells exhibit faster kinetics of calcium transient decay, a longer action potential duration at 70% repolarization (APD70), and enhanced expression of SERCA pumps for rapid SR reuptake [[5,6]]. Finally, transcriptional and epigenetic regulation plays a pivotal role. This includes the switch from fetal to adult gene isoforms, such as the Myosin Heavy Chain (Myh6/Myh7), Troponin I (Tnni1/3), and Titin (N2BA/N2B) isoforms, which is orchestrated by a network of transcription factors like GATA4, MEF2, SRF, and PPARs, and fine-tuned by post-transcriptional regulators like miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs [[1,6,9]].\n\n| Feature | Immature PSC-CM | Mature Adult Cardiomyocyte |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Structure** | Round, single-nucleated; disorganized sarcomeres without M-lines; absent T-tubules [[3]] | Rod-shaped; aligned sarcomeres with M-lines; well-developed T-tubules; binucleated (>80% in rodents, ~25% in humans) [[1,9]] |\n| **Sarcomere Length** | ~1.5-1.7 μm [[1,5]] | ~2.2 μm [[1]] |\n| **Cellular Volume** | Small | Over 30-fold increase from fetal stage [[1]] |\n| **Mitochondria** | Few, underdeveloped, occupies ~10-15% cell volume; no cristae [[2,3]] | Abundant, occupies up to 40% cell volume; dense cristae [[1,6]] |\n| **Metabolism** | Glycolysis dominant | Fatty Acid Oxidation (FAO) dominant; shifts to OXPHOS [[2,6]] |\n| **Resting Membrane Potential** | Unstable, depolarized (-50 to -60 mV) [[3]] | Stable, hyperpolarized (~−85 mV) [[1,9]] |\n| **Action Potential** | No plateau phase; automaticity [[3]] | Plateau phase present; stable RMP; longer APD70 [[1,5]] |\n| **Calcium Handling** | Slower kinetics; less stable [[4]] | Faster decay; larger amplitude; organized SR-T-tubule dyads [[1]] |\n| **Gene Expression** | Fetal isoforms (e.g., Myh6, Tnni3) [[1]] | Adult isoforms (e.g., Myh7, Tnni1) [[1,6]] |"

      "content": "The pursuit of mature cardiomyocytes for regenerative medicine has evolved significantly since the initial derivation of human embryonic stem cells. Early efforts focused on optimizing the basic steps of cardiac differentiation, with the goal that further maturation would occur spontaneously *in vitro*. However, it quickly became apparent that PSC-derived cardiomyocytes arrested at an early, fetal-like stage, prompting a paradigm shift in the field towards actively promoting maturation as a separate and necessary step [[3,12]]. This realization laid the foundation for decades of research dedicated to uncovering the biological cues that drive maturation *in vivo* and translating them into laboratory protocols.\n\nIn the early days, maturation strategies were rudimentary, often relying on simple culture conditions and the passage of time. While prolonged culture could lead to some degree of improvement, such as minor enhancements in sarcomere structure, it was insufficient to achieve a truly adult phenotype [[9]]. The first major milestone was the recognition that physical forces were critical for cardiac development. Researchers began experimenting with mechanical conditioning, using devices to apply static or cyclic stretch to 2D cultures of PSC-CMs [[9]]. Simultaneously, electrical stimulation, delivered via electrodes to induce pacing, was introduced as another way to mimic the physiological environment of the beating heart [[9]]. While these individual approaches showed promise, demonstrating improvements in contractile force, metabolic activity, and gene expression, the gains were incremental. The true breakthrough came with the understanding that these stimuli were not independent but synergistic. A landmark study demonstrated that combining electrical pacing with physiological calcium levels resulted in accelerated maturation that surpassed what could be achieved with either stimulus alone, highlighting the importance of integrating multiple modalities [[4]]. This insight marked a turning point from one-dimensional thinking to a multimodal approach.\n\nAnother significant milestone was the move towards three-dimensional (3D) culture systems. The limitations of 2D monolayers, where cells grow flat and lack proper cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, spurred the development of engineered heart tissues (EHTs), cardiac organoids, and other 3D constructs [[2,9]]. EHTs, in particular, proved to be a powerful platform. By seeding PSC-CMs onto collagen-coated silicone cords and allowing them to form a dense, aligned tissue construct, researchers created a system that applied continuous passive tension, mimicking the natural preload of the heart wall. When combined with electrical pacing, EHTs drove significant improvements in structural organization, metabolic function, and contractile force, pushing PSC-CMs to a level approaching the late fetal stage of development [[3,4]]. This work underscored the principle that the extracellular microenvironment, beyond just soluble factors, plays a critical role in directing maturation.\n\nFurther milestones were reached by integrating different cell types. The observation that co-culturing PSC-CMs with non-cardiomyocytes, such as cardiac fibroblasts and endothelial cells, led to enhanced maturation was a critical advance [[9,12]]. This reflected the reality of the native heart, a complex organ composed of multiple cell types interacting in a shared niche. Similarly, the xenotransplantation of human PSC-CMs into the hearts of neonatal rats emerged as a powerful *in vivo* maturation strategy. Within a few months, the grafted human cells matured extensively, adopting an adult-like phenotype in response to the host's developmental signals and mechanical load [[13]]. This provided invaluable proof-of-concept and insights into the maturation program but raised significant ethical concerns and highlighted the need for scalable *in vitro* alternatives. More recently, the advent of advanced omics technologies and computational biology has allowed for a deeper, more quantitative understanding of the maturation process, enabling the identification of novel regulatory pathways and biomarkers [[8,15]]. This data-driven approach is paving the way for the next generation of rational, precision maturation strategies."

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Driven by the need for functionally mature cardiomyocytes, the field has developed a sophisticated toolbox of methods that target various aspects of the maturation program. These state-of-the-art techniques can be broadly categorized into biochemical, biophysical, and bioengineering approaches, with the most successful strategies invariably employing a combination of these modalities to achieve synergistic effects. The overarching goal is to replicate the complex and dynamic environment of the developing and adult heart *in vitro*.\n\nBiochemical strategies aim to provide the soluble signals that orchestrate maturation. Hormonal supplementation is a cornerstone of many protocols. The addition of triiodothyronine (T3), dexamethasone (a glucocorticoid), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)—collectively known as TID—has been shown to enhance respiratory rates, promote metabolic maturation, and upregulate genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation [[1,2]]. T3, in particular, is a key regulator of the metabolic switch from glycolysis to FAO [[1,9]]. Beyond hormones, metabolic engineering focuses on altering the composition of the culture medium. Switching cells to media containing albumin-bound fatty acids or supplementing with galactose, oleic acid, and palmitic acid can drive a shift toward fatty acid utilization [[2]]. Some protocols also involve glucose deprivation or activation of metabolic signaling pathways like PPARα and AMPK to further push maturation [[9,17]]. Transcriptional and epigenetic modulation represents a more direct, albeit challenging, approach. Gene editing tools are being explored to modulate key regulators, while the use of small molecules to activate transcriptional co-activators like PGC-1α or ERRα, or to inhibit pathways like HIF-1α, offers a pharmacological route to steer the maturation program [[9,17]]. One innovative example is the forced expression of the transcription factor Brachyury (T), which was shown to enhance sarcomere length, mitochondrial function, and electrophysiological maturity in hiPSC-CMs within standard 2D culture [[5]].\n\nBiophysical and bioengineering approaches seek to recreate the mechanical and spatial cues that are critical for cardiac development. Mechanical stimulation remains a powerful tool. Cyclic stretch, often applied at frequencies of 1–3 Hz, can mimic the strain experienced by cardiomyocytes in the heart wall, improving contractility and structural organization [[3,9]]. Electrical stimulation, or pacing, is widely used to synchronize contractions and promote the development of organized sarcomeres and T-tubules. Modern systems allow for gradual ramping of frequency up to 6 Hz, which has proven effective in enhancing maturation [[4,9]]. Geometric engineering is another key technique. By using micropatterning on substrates like polyacrylamide gels or PLGA, researchers can force PSC-CMs to adopt a rod-like morphology and align their sarcomeres in a uniaxial fashion, a crucial first step toward tissue-level organization [[9]]. Substrate stiffness itself is a critical parameter, with optimal stiffness for cardiac differentiation reported to be in the range of 3.1–21 kPa, reflecting the elasticity of native heart tissue [[9]].\n\nThe most advanced and promising maturation strategies combine these different modalities within sophisticated 3D culture platforms. Engineered Heart Tissues (EHTs) are a prime example. By culturing PSC-CMs in a 3D collagen matrix that is stretched taut between two wires, EHTs create a mechanically active and structurally constrained environment that promotes robust maturation [[3,4]]. Combining EHTs with hormonal cocktails and electrical pacing yields synergistic results, improving metabolic function, contractile force, and gene expression far beyond any single intervention [[1,2]]. Scaffold-free bioprinting and the use of decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) derived from pig, rat, or bovine hearts are also being used to create more biomimetic 3D constructs [[9]]. Co-culture with other cell types is another dimension of bioengineering. Incorporating cardiac fibroblasts, endothelial cells, or mesenchymal stem cells into 3D constructs enhances paracrine signaling, improves vascularization, and leads to better maturation and integration of the CMs [[9,13]]. Finally, *in vivo* maturation, though ethically complex, remains a gold standard for achieving full maturity. Xenotransplanting human PSC-CMs into neonatal rat hearts or subcutaneous implantation in immunodeficient mice can lead to near-complete maturation over several weeks or months, providing invaluable models for studying cardiac development and disease [[1,13]]. These integrated, multi-modal approaches represent the current frontier in the quest for mature cardiomyocytes."

      "content": "The successful maturation of pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes unlocks a vast array of applications, bridging fundamental research, preclinical drug discovery, and clinical therapeutics. The ultimate goal is to translate these advances into effective treatments for patients with heart disease, although significant hurdles remain. The primary application areas include cell-based therapies for cardiac repair, disease modeling for drug development, and the generation of cell-free therapeutic agents like extracellular vesicles.\n\nIn the realm of regenerative medicine, the core application is the use of matured CMs to repair damaged myocardium. The concept is to transplant healthy, functionally mature CMs into areas of scar tissue to restore contractile function and prevent adverse remodeling. Various delivery formats are being investigated. Dispersed cell injection is a straightforward method but suffers from poor retention and survival of the transplanted cells [[12,13]]. To overcome this, engineered heart muscle (EHM) patches are emerging as a superior strategy. These patches, composed of a dense, 3D network of PSC-CMs, can be seeded onto a biocompatible scaffold and implanted onto the heart [[13]]. This approach improves cell retention, integration, and vascularization compared to cell injections [[13]]. Several clinical trials are underway to test this approach. For instance, the BioVAT-HF trial (NCT04396899) is recruiting patients for the transplantation of iPSC-derived engineered heart muscle for advanced heart failure [[11]]. Earlier studies, such as the ESCORT trial (NCT02057900), implanted hESC-derived cardiac progenitor cells in a fibrin patch in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and observed improved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with no tumors or arrhythmias over a median follow-up of 18 months [[11,12]]. More recently, a case report documented the safe transplantation of iPSC-derived CM patches in three ischemic cardiomyopathy patients with no major adverse events over a 3-month period [[11]]. These studies demonstrate proof-of-concept for safety and feasibility, but large-scale efficacy trials are needed.\n\nBeyond direct cell transplantation, mature CMs serve as powerful tools for disease modeling and drug discovery. Patient-specific hiPSCs can be generated from individuals with inherited cardiomyopathies, channelopathies, or other genetic heart diseases. Differentiating these cells into CMs allows researchers to study the cellular and molecular basis of the disease in a dish, a process known as \"disease in a dish.\" Mature CMs are particularly valuable because their fetal-like phenotype can obscure disease-related phenotypes. By maturing the cells, researchers can observe more pronounced and clinically relevant defects in calcium handling, contractility, and electrophysiology, providing a more accurate model for screening new drugs [[10]]. This approach is crucial for personalized medicine, as it allows for testing drug responses on patient-specific cells before administration.\n\nA third, rapidly growing application is the use of cell-free products derived from CMs, most notably extracellular vesicles (EVs). Instead of transplanting live cells, which carry risks of arrhythmias and tumorigenesis, EVs offer a safer alternative [[14]]. These nanoscale vesicles, secreted by cells, carry a cargo of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (including miRNAs) that can exert therapeutic effects on recipient cells. Stem-cell-derived EVs, including those from PSC-CMs, have been shown to reduce inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis while promoting angiogenesis and improving cardiac function in animal models of myocardial infarction [[14]]. For example, CM-EVs are enriched with miRNAs that support angiogenesis and antifibrotic processes, while MSC-EVs carry anti-inflammatory cargos [[14]]. A 2024 clinical trial reported improved LVEF after intravenous administration of hiPSC-derived cardiosphere-derived cell EVs in a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy, marking a significant step toward clinical translation for this cell-free therapy [[14]]. This approach circumvents many of the ethical and safety issues associated with cell transplantation and opens a new frontier in cardiac regenerative medicine.\n\n| Application Area | Method | Key Advantages | Key Challenges | Representative Studies/Trials |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Cell-Based Therapy** | Engineered Heart Muscle (EHM) Patch Implantation | Better cell retention, integration, and vascularization vs. cell injection [[13]]. | Arrhythmogenic risk, immune rejection, scalability [[10,13]]. | BioVAT-HF (NCT04396899); ESCORT (NCT02057900) [[11,12]]. |\n| **Cell-Based Therapy** | Dispersed Cell Injection | Simpler procedure. | Poor cell retention, survival, and engraftment [[12,13]]. | Liu et al. porcine model showing improved LVEF [[12]]. |\n| **Disease Modeling** | Matured hiPSC-CMs in Culture | Patient-specific disease modeling, drug screening [[10]]. | Immature phenotype can still limit utility, though better than standard PSC-CMs [[12]]. | Not specified in sources, but cited as a general application [[10]]. |\n| **Cell-Free Therapy** | Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) | Safer than live cells (no tumorigenesis/arrhythmias), easier to store and administer [[14]]. | Low cellular uptake, biodistribution to liver, scalable production [[14]]. | Case report of hiPSC-derived CPC-EV treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy [[14]]. |"

      "heading": "Critical Analysis of Current Capabilities and Persistent Challenges",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Despite remarkable progress in maturation technology, a critical analysis reveals a significant gap between the capabilities of current *in vitro* systems and the desired outcome of fully mature, adult-like cardiomyocytes. While modern protocols can successfully induce a degree of maturation, pushing PSC-CMs toward an intermediate, late-fetal or early-neonatal phenotype, they consistently fall short of achieving complete maturity [[3,9]]. This \"immaturity ceiling\" represents the single greatest challenge facing the field. The most advanced *in vitro* systems, such as paced EHTs, can improve structural organization, metabolic function, and contractile force, but they do not appear to surpass the late fetal stage of development [[3]]. This limitation fundamentally constrains their utility. For instance, even matured CMs retain a degree of pacemaker current and residual automaticity, posing a significant arrhythmogenic risk when transplanted into an adult heart [[1,10]]. Similarly, incomplete electromechanical coupling with the host myocardium remains a major obstacle to effective functional integration [[10]].\n\nA second major challenge is the inherent heterogeneity of PSC-derived populations. Differentiation protocols yield a mixed population of cardiomyocytes, including atrial, ventricular, and nodal-like cells, each with distinct maturation profiles. Isolating and maturing a pure population of adult-like ventricular CMs, the cell type most needed for contractile replacement, is a difficult task. Furthermore, maturation is not a uniform process across all cells in a given culture. There is significant variability in the degree of maturation among individual cells, making it difficult to obtain a homogenous and reliable cell product for research or therapy. This heterogeneity complicates data interpretation in disease modeling and poses safety risks in cell-based treatments.\n\nScalability and reproducibility are also persistent hurdles. Many of the advanced maturation protocols, especially those involving 3D constructs and co-cultures, are complex and difficult to standardize across different laboratories and cell lines. The reliance on xenogeneic materials, such as pig-derived decellularized ECM, raises concerns about batch-to-batch variability, immunogenicity, and the potential for zoonotic contamination, hindering clinical translation [[9]]. Developing defined, xeno-free, and scalable manufacturing processes that can produce a consistent, high-quality cell product remains a formidable engineering challenge. The cost and complexity of these advanced systems also pose a barrier to widespread adoption.\n\nFinally, there is a fundamental disconnect between our ability to manipulate cellular processes and our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. While we can induce maturation by activating certain pathways or applying specific stimuli, the precise causal relationships and crosstalk between different maturation pathways are not fully understood [[9,17]]. For example, while it is clear that metabolic maturation is linked to structural and electrophysiological changes, the exact molecular mechanisms that couple these processes remain undefined [[9]]. This lack of mechanistic clarity makes it difficult to design rational, targeted maturation strategies and instead relies on empirical optimization. Without a deeper understanding of how a cell \"knows\" it is mature, progress will likely remain incremental. Addressing these challenges will require a concerted effort from biologists, engineers, and clinicians to develop more sophisticated models, improve our mechanistic understanding, and establish robust, scalable, and clinically compliant manufacturing standards."

      "content": "The future of cardiomyocyte maturation research lies in moving beyond empirical optimization toward a more predictive, systems-level understanding of the maturation program. The next wave of innovation will be driven by interdisciplinary collaboration and the integration of advanced technologies to address the field's most pressing challenges. The ultimate goal is to develop scalable, reliable, and clinically viable methods for producing mature cardiomyocytes and harnessing their therapeutic potential in novel ways.\n\nOne of the most promising future directions is the development of *in silico* models and computational frameworks to guide maturation. By integrating multi-omics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) from cells at different stages of maturation, researchers can build detailed maps of the maturation trajectory [[8,15]]. These models can then be used to identify master regulators and key checkpoints in the maturation process, allowing for the rational design of combinatorial interventions. Computational simulations, such as those predicting mitochondrial maturation fidelity based on different combinations of stimuli, can help optimize protocols *before* conducting expensive and time-consuming wet-lab experiments [[17]]. This data-driven approach holds the potential to systematically close the gap between late-fetal and adult maturity.\n\nAnother key area for future research is the continued refinement of 3D bioengineering platforms. The next generation of engineered cardiac tissues will likely incorporate greater complexity, including perfusable vasculature, a more representative extracellular matrix, and co-cultures with a wider range of cell types found in the native heart, such as pericytes and macrophages [[9]]. Organ-on-a-chip systems that simulate hemodynamic flow and pressure could provide an even more physiologically relevant environment for driving maturation. Furthermore, advancements in bioprinting and materials science will enable the creation of patient-specific, anatomically shaped cardiac patches that could be tailored to the precise geometry of a patient's scar tissue.\n\nEmerging therapeutic paradigms are also shifting the focus away from cell transplantation. As discussed, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are gaining traction as a potent, cell-free therapeutic modality [[14]]. Future research will concentrate on scaling up the production and purification of EVs, identifying the most potent pro-regenerative EV subpopulations, and engineering EVs for enhanced targeting and cargo loading. Hypoxic preconditioning and genetic engineering of donor cells are already being used to enrich EVs with specific therapeutic cargos, such as miRNAs that promote angiogenesis or inhibit fibrosis [[14]]. The development of engineered EVs with surface modifications for cardiac-targeting peptides could dramatically improve their delivery to the injured heart [[14]].\n\nFinally, the integration of regenerative medicine with other fields, such as immunology and genetics, will open new avenues for treatment. Strategies to modulate the host immune response to allogeneic grafts, such as using thymosin β4 or co-transplanting immunomodulatory cells, could overcome the need for lifelong immunosuppression [[13]]. Gene editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 offer the possibility of correcting disease-causing mutations in patient-specific hiPSCs *before* differentiation, enabling the creation of genetically corrected, mature CMs for autologous transplantation [[10]]. Additionally, the discovery of novel pro-regenerative factors, such as primitive macrophage-conditioned medium, points to entirely new ways to stimulate endogenous cardiac repair [[16]]. In summary, the future of the field is bright, with maturation research poised to deliver not only better-engineered cells but also transformative, cell-free therapies and a deeper understanding of cardiac biology that will ultimately benefit patients with heart disease.\n\n---"
