      "content": "The residential property sector stands as a cornerstone of modern economies, serving dual functions as both a primary residence for households and a significant asset class for investors. The behavior of those who invest in this market—ranging from individual homeowners to vast institutional funds—is a critical determinant of housing affordability, market stability, and social equity. Understanding the motivations, actions, and impacts of these diverse investor types is therefore not merely an academic exercise but a prerequisite for effective urban planning, sound economic policy, and the mitigation of social harm. This review seeks to systematically examine the scholarly literature on residential property investor types, interrogating the complex question of whether they are \"one and the same\" or constitute a heterogeneous collection of actors with distinct characteristics and consequences. By synthesizing findings across disciplines and geographies, this paper aims to clarify the key distinctions that define different investor categories, analyze their collective impact on housing markets and communities, and chart a course for future research.\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from a growing body of evidence suggesting that the effects of investment in housing are far from uniform. While some forms of investment can lead to vibrant, stable neighborhoods, others are implicated in driving speculative bubbles, displacing long-term residents, and exacerbating social inequality [[5,6]]. For instance, in China's urban real estate market, speculative demand has become dominant since 2000, fueling rapid price inflation and creating conditions ripe for financial instability [[6]]. Similarly, the influx of overseas capital into global cities like Sydney and Vancouver has been linked to heightened housing costs and altered local dynamics, raising questions about foreign ownership and its societal implications [[1]]. These disparate outcomes underscore the necessity of moving beyond a monolithic view of the investor and toward a more granular understanding of the specific actors shaping the residential landscape. Policy interventions designed to curb speculation, promote affordable housing, or stabilize markets cannot succeed without a clear-eyed assessment of which investor types are being targeted and how effectively.\n\nThis review addresses a gap identified in previous systematic analyses: while the literature extensively documents the *effects* of investment, it often lacks a robust, integrated framework for defining and distinguishing the *actors* themselves [[1]]. A seminal 2020 review noted that only 117 out of 642 analyzed articles specified the type of investor under study, highlighting a pervasive ambiguity in the field [[1]]. This ambiguity complicates comparative analysis and hinders the development of nuanced policy responses. Furthermore, the literature exhibits disciplinary disparities; economics tends to dominate behavioral studies, while urban planning contributes significantly to discussions on investment objects and finance, indicating a need for greater interdisciplinary synthesis [[1]]. By systematically reviewing the definitions, classifications, behaviors, and impacts of various investor types—from mom-and-pop landlords and sophisticated flippers to institutional giants and international speculators—this paper provides a foundational resource for researchers and policymakers. It clarifies the key dimensions along which investors differ, such as their scale of operation, financing mechanisms, and strategic objectives, thereby fostering a more precise and impactful discourse on the role of investment in our cities. The ultimate objective is to move the conversation forward by identifying the most salient differences between investor types and illuminating the pathways through which these differences translate into tangible outcomes for housing markets and society."

      "level": 2,
      "content": "A foundational challenge in the study of residential property investors is the lack of a universally accepted definition of \"investor.\" The provided literature suggests that the term is used loosely and often interchangeably with other roles, such as landlord, owner, or speculator, obscuring important distinctions. A productive approach is to conceptualize an investor not by a single attribute but by a set of characteristics that define their relationship to the property and their goals within the market. An investor, in this context, is an individual or entity that acquires residential property primarily to generate a financial return, rather than for personal or family occupancy. This definition immediately separates them from owner-occupiers and aligns them conceptually with other asset classes. However, this simple distinction belies a profound diversity of actors, each with unique strategies, risk appetites, and market impacts. The literature proposes several meta-categorization frameworks to capture this complexity, moving beyond the simplistic dichotomy of \"investor vs. owner.\"\n\nOne of the most comprehensive frameworks was proposed in a 2020 systematic review, which suggested a four-part model for categorizing residential property investors [[1]]. The first dimension is **spatial scale of operation**, which distinguishes between actors operating at different geographical levels, including local, regional, national, international, or global scales. This dimension is particularly relevant in an era of increasing globalization, where flows of capital across borders have reshaped local housing markets [[1]]. The second dimension is **size and social composition**, which broadly classifies investors by their organizational form and social status. This includes individual or \"mom-and-pop\" landlords, larger private owners, institutional investors managing pooled capital, and the super-rich investing through opaque structures [[1]]. The third dimension focuses on the **investment object and finance**, which looks at the specific purpose of the investment (e.g., buy-to-rent, buy-to-live, buy-to-leave) and the financing mechanism used (e.g., debt vs. equity, private equity, Real Estate Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) investors) [[1]]. The fourth dimension addresses **investment and social behavior**, which examines how investors operate within the market, classifying them based on their decision-making processes (e.g., rational vs. irrational), sophistication (e.g., sophisticated vs. unsophisticated), or specific predatory tactics (e.g., \"predatory flippers,\" \"milker investors\") [[1]].\n\nAnother influential framework comes from a 2025 study focusing specifically on Residential Rental Property Owners (RRPOs) [[2]]. This model organizes investor types around three core dimensions: **Career**, **Strategy**, and **Operations**. The Career dimension encompasses demographic characteristics and the owner's professional or life-stage context. The Strategy dimension includes portfolio size, investment objectives (e.g., cash flow, capital growth), property class, and rent-setting strategy. Finally, the Operations dimension details the practicalities of management, such as property maintenance practices and the use of eviction procedures [[2]]. This framework provides a more granular look at the operational realities of owning rental properties, emphasizing the day-to-day decisions that shape tenant experiences and property value.\n\nThese frameworks highlight that investor typologies are not static but are constructed based on multiple intersecting variables. The choice of which variables to prioritize depends heavily on the research question. For a macroeconomic analysis of market stability, the scale of operation (local vs. international) and the financing mechanism (debt vs. equity) might be paramount. For a study focused on tenant welfare, the operational strategies related to rent setting and evictions would take precedence. The following table summarizes the key definitional approaches found in the literature.\n\n| Dimension | Description | Examples / Subtypes | Source(s) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Spatial Scale** | The geographical area over which the investor operates. | Local, Regional, International, Global, Foreign, Overseas Investors | [[1]] |\n| **Size & Social Composition** | The organizational and social profile of the investor. | Individual, Mom-and-Pop, Institutional, Super-Rich, Middle-Class Investors | [[1]] |\n| **Investment Object & Finance** | The purpose of the investment and how it is funded. | Buy-to-Rent, Buy-to-Live, Buy-to-Leave, Debt vs. Equity, Private Equity, RMBS Investors | [[1]] |\n| **Behavioral & Operational** | The strategic and tactical methods used in investment. | Rational vs. Irrational, Sophisticated vs. Unsophisticated, Predatory Flippers, Milker Investors | [[1]] |\n| **Career, Strategy, Operations** | The owner's background, investment goals, and management practices. | Demographics, Portfolio Size, Rent Setting, Eviction Practices, Property Management | [[2]] |\n\nBy adopting these multi-dimensional frameworks, researchers can avoid the analytical trap of treating all investors as a homogenous group. Instead, they can explore how combinations of these characteristics produce different market behaviors and social outcomes. For example, a \"short-term flipper\" defined by a high turnover rate is a distinct actor from a \"long-term milker\" focused on maximizing rental income, even though both are classified as investors [[1,4]]. The former's activity may contribute to price volatility, while the latter's may lead to deteriorating housing stock and poor tenant relations. Recognizing these distinctions is the first step toward developing targeted and effective policies to manage the multifaceted role of investment in the residential sector."

      "heading": "Historical Development and Milestones",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The landscape of residential property investment has evolved dramatically over the past few decades, shaped by landmark economic events, technological advancements, and shifts in regulatory regimes. Understanding this historical trajectory is crucial for contextualizing current market dynamics and investor behaviors. The literature points to several key milestones that have fundamentally altered how property is bought, financed, and owned.\n\nA pivotal event in many markets was the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008. In its aftermath, there was a significant increase in the literature discussing the financialization of housing [[1]]. This period saw the rise of sophisticated institutional investors, including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), entering residential markets, attracted by the relative stability of housing compared to other asset classes. The GFC also led to a re-evaluation of leverage and risk, influencing the strategies of both new and existing investors. In Australia, for example, the crisis prompted the introduction of new regulations for foreign investment, such as the Foreign Resident Capital Gains Withholding (FRCGW) tax, which requires a 12.5% withholding on the sale of property valued at $750,000 or more, effective until 2024 when it will increase to 15% [[7]]. This policy represents a direct response to the perceived risks of foreign capital flows destabilizing the domestic market.\n\nIn the United States, a foundational legislative milestone occurred much earlier with the enactment of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (FIRPTA) on June 18, 1980 [[8]]. FIRPTA subjects foreign persons disposing of U.S. real property interests (USRPIs) to U.S. income tax as if the gain were connected to a U.S. trade or business. To enforce this, IRC 1445, effective January 1, 1985, mandates that the transferee (the buyer) withhold 15% of the amount realized from the transaction and remit it to the IRS [[8]]. This legislation established a precedent for taxing foreign real estate transactions and created a formal administrative framework managed by the IRS, using databases like INTLWebApps and verification tools like Accurint [[8]]. FIRPTA's influence extends to the classification of entities; for example, REITs are generally treated as U.S. real property holding companies (USRPHCs) unless they meet specific domestic control requirements, making their shares a USRPI subject to the act [[8]]. These regulations demonstrate an early and persistent effort by governments to regulate and tax foreign participation in their domestic property markets.\n\nMore recently, the evolution of technology and data availability has been a major driver of change. The proliferation of digital platforms and big data sources has transformed market analysis and investment strategies. Studies now leverage data from sources like Craigslist, CoStar Group, and Chinese portals like 58.com for rental market forecasting and spatial dynamics analysis [[3]]. This shift towards data-driven analysis allows for more granular and timely insights into market trends, enabling investors to make more informed decisions. For instance, a study on Hong Kong's private housing market utilized transaction-level data from the Land Registry to precisely measure the impact of investor entry on price dispersion, demonstrating the power of detailed datasets [[4]]. This reliance on data-intensive methods represents a significant departure from earlier periods when analysis was often constrained by less frequent and less detailed official statistics.\n\nFurthermore, the nature of investment itself has changed. The literature highlights a trend towards specialization among investors. For example, short-term \"flippers\" have become a recognized category, whose behavior is influenced by specific policy instruments like Hong Kong's Special Stamp Duty (SSD), which taxes resales within six to thirty-six months at rates up to 20% [[4]]. Similarly, the concept of the \"milker investor,\" who holds a property for long-term rental income, is distinguished from the flipper based on holding duration and strategic objectives [[1,2]]. These specialized roles did not exist to the same degree in the past, reflecting a maturation of the market into a more complex ecosystem of actors with diverse strategies. The historical progression from relatively simple forms of ownership to this modern, highly stratified, data-informed, and globally interconnected system of investment underscores the dynamic nature of the residential property sector and the constant adaptation required by both investors and regulators."

      "heading": "Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The study of residential property investor types has matured significantly, incorporating a diverse array of methodological approaches to capture the complexity of this field. The literature reflects a healthy tension and growing integration between quantitative and qualitative techniques, each offering unique strengths for understanding investor behavior and its consequences. A prominent theme is the call for mixed-method approaches that combine the statistical power of quantitative data with the rich contextual detail provided by qualitative inquiry, a recommendation made explicitly by authors of a 2020 systematic review [[1]].\n\nQuantitative methods are the bedrock of much contemporary research, particularly for analyzing large-scale market trends and testing hypotheses. The most common techniques include regression modeling, correlation analysis, and hedonic modeling [[3]]. Hedonic modeling, for instance, is frequently used to estimate the implicit price of specific property attributes, allowing researchers to isolate the effect of an investment strategy from other factors influencing price. A 2025 study on Hong Kong's private housing market employed a combined hedonic-repeat sales model to measure quality-adjusted price dispersion, finding that one percent of new investor entry was associated with a 0.58 percent decrease in price variation [[4]]. This demonstrates how sophisticated quantitative models can disentangle the specific impact of investor activity on market stability. Other advanced techniques include the use of panel data models to analyze changes over time and geographic information systems (GIS) to map the spatial distribution and spillover effects of investor activities [[3,4]]. The reliance on big data from sources like real estate listing platforms (e.g., CoStar, Lianjia), government registries (e.g., Hong Kong Land Registry), and even social media is a hallmark of the state-of-the-art, enabling more granular and real-time analysis than ever before [[3,4]].\n\nDespite the power of quantitative methods, they often fall short in explaining the \"why\" behind the observed patterns. This is where qualitative methods become indispensable. In-depth interviews, ethnographic observation, and case studies allow researchers to access the subjective experiences, motivations, and reasoning of investors and tenants alike. For example, a study conducted in Shenzhen, China, used 30 in-depth interviews with both landlords and tenants to analyze power differentials in the rental market, providing a rich narrative that complements any statistical analysis [[5]]. This qualitative work revealed how wider power gaps enable landlords to extract class-monopoly rent, a dynamic that purely quantitative studies might miss [[5]]. Similarly, a 2025 study on RRPOs emphasized the importance of survey and qualitative data to understand operational practices and informal strategies, such as \"cash for keys\" arrangements to avoid formal evictions [[2]]. These methods provide the necessary depth to understand the human element of investment, revealing the nuances of landlord-tenant relationships and the practical application of investment strategies.\n\nThe most insightful research often lies at the intersection of these two worlds. A mixed-method approach allows for triangulation, where quantitative findings can be explored in greater depth through qualitative inquiry, and qualitative findings can be tested against broader statistical trends. The 2020 review by Badarinza et al. advocated strongly for this combination, arguing that linking quantitative financial data with qualitative behavioral insights is essential for a holistic understanding of investor types [[1]]. This integrative approach is particularly valuable for studying complex phenomena like speculative bubbles. For instance, a researcher could use quantitative data to identify periods of speculative activity in a city like Shenzhen, where commercial housing sales grew immensely after 2000 [[6]], and then use qualitative methods to understand the psychological drivers and belief systems that sustained the bubble. This kind of integrated analysis is critical for developing effective policy, as it moves beyond simply observing correlations to understanding causal mechanisms. The table below outlines the primary methodological approaches and their applications in the field.\n\n| Methodological Approach | Key Techniques | Primary Application / Strength | Source(s) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Quantitative Analysis** | Regression Modeling, Correlation Analysis, Hedonic Modelling, Time-Series/Panel Data Models | Identifying statistical relationships, measuring market-wide impacts, forecasting trends. | [[3,4]] |\n| **Qualitative Analysis** | In-depth Interviews, Ethnography, Case Studies, Content Analysis | Exploring motivations, understanding subjective experiences, capturing informal practices. | [[2,5]] |\n| **Mixed-Methods** | Triangulation of Quantitative and Qualitative Data | Integrating statistical evidence with contextual narratives to explain *how* and *why*. | [[1]] |\n| **Big Data Analytics** | Machine Learning, Text Mining, GIS Mapping | Analyzing large, unstructured datasets (e.g., listings, social media) for real-time insights. | [[3,4]] |\n| **Policy Evaluation** | Cost-Benefit Analysis, Simulation Models | Assessing the effectiveness of specific interventions like resale taxes or CGT. | [[6,7]] |\n\nUltimately, the current state-of-the-art recognizes that no single method is sufficient. The most robust conclusions about investor types emerge from a thoughtful combination of techniques that leverage the breadth of quantitative data and the depth of qualitative insight. As the field continues to evolve, the development and application of these hybrid methodologies will be central to advancing our understanding of this critical aspect of the modern economy."

      "heading": "Applications and Case Studies",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The theoretical and empirical work on residential property investor types finds its most compelling expression in real-world applications and case studies, which ground abstract concepts in specific economic, social, and political contexts. These studies reveal how investor behavior translates into tangible outcomes, from affecting housing prices and market volatility to shaping community dynamics and triggering policy responses. The provided sources offer a range of illustrative examples from diverse global settings, highlighting both the universal principles and the localized specifics of investment activity.\n\nOne of the most well-documented applications is the impact of investor activity on housing price dynamics. A study of Hong Kong's private housing market from 1994 to 2019 provides a powerful quantitative example. It found that the entry of new investors has a statistically significant dampening effect on housing price dispersion—the degree to which prices deviate from a mean level [[4]]. Specifically, a one percent increase in new investor entry turnover was associated with a 0.58 percent decrease in price dispersion, an effect that was particularly pronounced during market downturns [[4]]. This suggests that investors can act as stabilizers, absorbing shocks and preventing extreme price swings. However, the same study also showed that a one percent increase in investment property purchase turnover was linked to a stronger 1.07 percent reduction in price dispersion, indicating that the act of buying itself has a more potent stabilizing effect than just the presence of new investors [[4]]. This nuanced finding demonstrates that the *type* of investor activity—new entrants versus active buyers—matters for market outcomes.\n\nAnother critical application is the analysis of policy design and its impact on investor behavior. The experience of Hong Kong with its Special Stamp Duty (SSD) serves as a prime example. Introduced on November 20, 2010, the SSD taxes the sale of residential properties within six to thirty-six months of purchase at progressively higher rates (up to 20%) [[4]]. This policy directly influences investor strategy, encouraging longer holding periods and discouraging short-term flipping. The very definition of a \"flipper\"—a property resold within two years—is shaped by this fiscal instrument [[4]]. This illustrates a symbiotic relationship where policy creates new investor categories and shapes their behavior. Similarly, in Australia, the introduction of the Foreign Resident Capital Gains Withholding (FRCGW) tax on property valued at $750,000 or more demonstrates a targeted policy aimed at regulating a specific segment of investors—foreign residents—whose capital flows are seen as potentially destabilizing [[7]]. These cases show that investor types are not just passive economic actors but are actively responding to the incentive structures created by governments.\n\nCase studies also illuminate the social consequences of different investor strategies. A study in Shenzhen, China, applied Marxist theories of class-monopoly rent to analyze the power imbalance between landlords and tenants in the private rental market [[5]]. It found that landlords with greater power (often due to their position as property owners) employ various strategies to extract surplus value from tenants, negatively impacting their housing experience [[5]]. This work moves beyond price to consider the qualitative aspects of housing, such as security of tenure and living conditions, which are profoundly affected by the landlord's strategy. Another study in the United States, referencing the 2008 financial crisis, points to the collapse of Bangkok’s housing market in 1997 as a historical parallel, showing how speculative investor activity can lead to severe market crashes [[1]]. These examples underscore that the type of investor is directly linked to the social fabric of a community, influencing everything from housing affordability to neighborhood stability.\n\nFinally, the literature includes studies on the potential for alternative policy designs to mitigate negative investor impacts. A numerical model analyzing China's housing market explored two policy options to combat speculative demand [[6]]. Option 1 involved a resale tax modeled on second-degree price discrimination, which would tax high-end buyers more heavily. Option 2 proposed subsidizing low-end housing for purchase and imposing heavy taxes on luxury units [[6]]. The analysis concluded that a pro-poor subsidy/tax combination was more effective than a pro-rich tax-only policy [[6]]. This type of application-oriented research uses investor typologies as a basis for simulation and cost-benefit analysis, providing policymakers with evidence-based tools to design interventions that target specific investor behaviors to achieve desired social outcomes like increased housing affordability. Together, these diverse case studies demonstrate that understanding investor types is essential for diagnosing market problems, designing appropriate solutions, and ultimately shaping more equitable and stable housing systems."

      "heading": "Challenges and Open Problems",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Despite significant progress, the study of residential property investor types is beset by a series of interconnected challenges and open problems that limit the scope and impact of current research. These issues span from fundamental definitional ambiguities to data limitations and the difficulty of establishing causality, hindering the development of a coherent and actionable body of knowledge. Addressing these challenges is paramount for the field's continued advancement.\n\nThe foremost challenge is definitional ambiguity. As previously noted, the term \"investor\" is often used imprecisely, conflating it with other roles like landlords or owners [[1]]. This lack of a standardized definition makes cross-study comparisons difficult and can lead to misleading conclusions. For example, a study might report on the impact of \"investors\" without specifying whether they are individuals, institutions, domestic, or foreign entities, thus aggregating vastly different groups with potentially divergent effects. A 2020 systematic review highlighted this issue starkly, noting that only 117 of 642 analyzed articles explicitly specified the type of investor being studied [[1]]. Without a shared lexicon, it becomes nearly impossible to build upon prior findings or synthesize results into a comprehensive understanding. This problem is compounded by disciplinary silos, where economists, sociologists, and planners may use the same terminology to mean different things, further fragmenting the literature [[1]].\n\nA second major hurdle is the scarcity of high-quality, granular data. Many studies rely on official statistics, which can be infrequent, aggregated, and lacking in the specific variables needed to distinguish between investor types [[3]]. While the use of big data and administrative records (like the Hong Kong Land Registry data used in one study [[4]]) is a promising development, these sources are not universally available and can be costly to acquire or access. Moreover, they may suffer from their own biases or limitations. For instance, non-arm's-length transactions, which are often excluded from analyses, can be significant in certain investor networks and their exclusion may skew results [[4]]. The underuse of emerging data sources, such as social media data, for studying informal housing markets is another noted gap, suggesting that our understanding of certain segments of the market is particularly weak [[3]]. This data scarcity forces many researchers to rely on proxies, which may not accurately capture the full complexity of investor behavior.\n\nA third challenge is the difficulty of establishing causality. Much of the research relies on observational data and correlation analysis, which can identify associations but cannot definitively prove that investor activity causes a particular outcome, such as rising house prices or declining tenancy quality. For instance, a study might find a strong correlation between foreign investment and housing price increases in Sydney or Vancouver [[1]], but it cannot, on its own, rule out other confounding factors, such as local population growth or interest rate changes. Establishing a causal link requires more sophisticated methods, such as natural experiments or quasi-experimental designs, which are often difficult to implement in the real world. This ambiguity between correlation and causation is a recurring theme in the literature and limits the strength of policy recommendations derived from correlational studies alone.\n\nFinally, there is a pressing need for more interdisciplinary collaboration. The literature suffers from a lack of integration between fields like economics, sociology, geography, and urban planning [[1]]. Economic models may excel at predicting market behavior but fail to capture the social context, while sociological studies may richly describe landlord-tenant interactions but overlook the macroeconomic incentives driving them. The call for mixed-method approaches combining quantitative and qualitative insights is a recognition of this deficit [[1]]. Yet, achieving this integration remains difficult. Bridging these disciplinary divides is essential for developing a holistic understanding of investor types—one that accounts for their financial motivations, social positioning, and operational practices simultaneously. Overcoming these challenges of definition, data, causality, and discipline will be the central task for future research if we are to move beyond fragmented snapshots and develop a truly comprehensive theory of residential property investment."

      "heading": "Future Research Directions",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "To overcome the existing challenges and deepen our understanding of residential property investor types, the literature suggests several promising avenues for future research. These directions aim to refine definitions, enhance methodologies, broaden geographical and thematic scope, and foster greater interdisciplinary collaboration. By pursuing these paths, researchers can build a more robust and actionable body of knowledge to inform policy and practice.\n\nFirst and foremost, future research must prioritize the development of more precise and standardized **definitional frameworks**. The field's current reliance on ambiguous terms is a significant barrier to progress. A critical next step is to move beyond general labels like \"institutional investor\" or \"foreigner\" and develop more granular typologies based on observable characteristics. Drawing inspiration from the multi-dimensional frameworks already proposed [[1,2]], future work should focus on empirically validating and refining these classifications. For example, longitudinal studies could track investors over time to see if they transition between categories (e.g., from a mom-and-pop landlord to an institutional fund manager). This would help determine whether these are truly distinct categories or points along a continuum. Furthermore, research should explicitly test the boundaries between different actor types, such as the line between an \"owner-occupier who happens to rent out a room\" and a \"buy-to-let landlord.\" Developing a validated, multi-item scale to classify investors would be a significant contribution, allowing for more meaningful comparisons across studies.\n\nSecond, there is a clear need for the adoption and development of more sophisticated **methodological approaches**. Building on the call for mixed-methods research [[1]], future studies should integrate quantitative and qualitative data more deeply. This could involve embedding qualitative interviews within large-scale quantitative surveys of landlords or pairing econometric analysis of market data with ethnographic case studies of specific neighborhoods. The use of novel data sources should also be expanded. For instance, leveraging data from online rental platforms, crowdfunding sites, or blockchain-based property registries could provide unprecedented granularity on investor activities, especially in sub-national or informal markets. Additionally, machine learning and artificial intelligence offer new opportunities for pattern recognition in large datasets, potentially uncovering hidden investor strategies or predicting market movements with greater accuracy. The goal should be to create models that are not just predictive but also explanatory, capable of simulating the effects of different investor behaviors under various policy scenarios.\n\nThird, the geographical and thematic scope of research needs expansion. While much of the existing literature focuses on developed economies like the US, UK, and Australia, there is a significant gap in our understanding of investor types in rapidly urbanizing regions, particularly in Asia, Africa, and Latin America [[3]]. Studying investor behavior in places like China, India, Nigeria, or Kenya is crucial for developing a truly global perspective [[3,6]]. These markets present unique conditions, such as the dominance of speculative demand in China [[6]] or the prevalence of informal rental housing in India [[3]]. Thematically, future research should delve deeper into the social and ethical dimensions of investment. This includes exploring the tenant experience in greater detail, investigating how different landlord strategies affect housing quality, mental health, and social cohesion. It also involves examining the role of gender, ethnicity, and other social identities in shaping investment patterns and outcomes—a topic largely absent from the provided sources but critically important for understanding housing inequality [[3]].\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, future research must break down disciplinary silos and foster genuine **interdisciplinary collaboration**. The challenges facing the housing sector—affordability, inequality, climate resilience—are too complex to be solved by any single discipline. Economists, urban planners, sociologists, geographers, and legal scholars must work together to build a holistic picture. This means co-authoring papers, participating in joint research grants, and creating forums for dialogue. A truly interdisciplinary project might combine economic modeling of investment flows with a sociological analysis of landlord-tenant power dynamics and a legal examination of the regulatory frameworks governing these activities. By integrating these diverse perspectives, researchers can move beyond partial explanations and develop a richer, more nuanced, and ultimately more useful understanding of the complex world of residential property investment.\n\n---"
