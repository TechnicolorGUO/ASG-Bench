## Introduction and Background

The practice of qualitative research has been profoundly reshaped by technological advancements, particularly in the realm of data collection. The traditional face-to-face interview, long considered the gold standard for generating rich, nuanced data on lived experiences and behavioral patterns, now exists alongside a diverse ecosystem of digital alternatives [[1]]. This review focuses on the systematic literature concerning digital interviews—the use of technology to conduct one-on-one qualitative conversations between a researcher and a participant. These methods encompass telephone calls, video conferencing platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams, and text-based formats such as chat or messaging apps like WhatsApp [[3,6,7]]. While these technologies have existed for decades, their adoption and methodological validation within academic research have been uneven, often lagging behind their widespread use in other sectors. The global COVID-19 pandemic served as a powerful catalyst, forcing a rapid and large-scale shift from planned in-person interactions to remote modes of data collection, thereby thrusting these methods into the mainstream of qualitative inquiry [[3]].

The motivation for this review stems from the need to critically assess the current state of knowledge regarding digital interviewing. As researchers increasingly turn to these methods out of necessity or convenience, it is imperative to understand not only their technical feasibility but also their profound impact on the research process—from participant rapport and data quality to ethical considerations and analytical rigour. This review aims to provide a comprehensive synthesis of existing literature to answer key questions: How do different digital modalities compare in terms of data richness and participant experience? What are the primary challenges associated with their use, and how can they be mitigated? And crucially, what does this evolving landscape mean for the future of qualitative methodology? By systematically examining the evidence, this paper seeks to illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of digital interviewing, identify critical research gaps, and chart a course for responsible and effective implementation in future studies.

This systematic review synthesizes findings from a range of peer-reviewed articles and reports published between 2000 and 2024 to address its central query. The sources were identified through a search of major academic databases, including MEDLINE, CINHAL, Web of Science, Scopus, and ASSIA [[7]]. The inclusion criteria focused on empirical studies that compared digital interview methods (video, telephone, text) with in-person interviews or discussed the specific applications and challenges of these methods. The review covers a wide array of geographical contexts, including studies from North America (USA, Canada, Australia), Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Africa, reflecting the global nature of this research trend [[7]]. The analysis focuses specifically on one-on-one interviews, though many of the insights are relevant to other forms of group interaction, such as virtual focus groups, which share similar technological foundations and challenges [[4]]. The objective is to produce a rigorous, insightful report that serves as a foundational resource for qualitative researchers navigating the complexities of conducting interviews in a digitally mediated world.

## Key Concepts and Definitions

To navigate the literature on digital interviews, it is essential to establish clear definitions and conceptual frameworks. The term "digital interview" broadly encompasses any qualitative interview conducted remotely using information and communication technologies. However, this umbrella term conceals significant methodological distinctions between various modalities, each with unique affordances and constraints. These modalities can be categorized primarily by the presence or absence of synchronous audiovisual contact.

The most fundamental distinction is between voice-only interviews and video-mediated interviews. Voice-only interviews, commonly known as telephone interviews, rely solely on auditory communication. This mode has been used for decades in market research and health surveys but has historically faced a degree of methodological skepticism within academic qualitative research [[5]]. Video-mediated interviews, facilitated by platforms such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Skype, reintroduce visual cues, allowing for a more direct simulation of the face-to-face encounter [[6,7]]. Text-based interviews represent another distinct category, utilizing asynchronous or synchronous messaging systems like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or Reddit PMs [[3,4,7]]. This format offers flexibility and anonymity but removes both auditory and visual channels of communication.

The literature reveals a notable hierarchy in the perception of these modalities. Early reviews framed Internet-based electronic interviews as "cutting edge," while telephone methods were often neglected or dismissed as inferior, despite their potential to generate high-quality data [[5]]. This perception gap persists, where newer technologies are imbued with a sense of novelty and innovation, whereas established methods like telephone calling are sometimes viewed merely as a temporary substitute for an idealized face-to-face interaction [[3,5]]. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that these technologies should be recognized not as poor imitations, but as autonomous and valid methods in their own right, each suited to different research questions, populations, and contexts [[3]].

Several key concepts emerge from the literature that help explain the dynamics of digital interviews. One such concept is **participant rapport**, which refers to the trust and connection built between the researcher and the participant. In face-to-face interviews, rapport is often cultivated through shared physical space and the interpretation of non-verbal cues like eye contact, facial expressions, and posture. The loss of these visual cues in telephone interviews raises concerns about the ability to build deep rapport [[5,6]]. Some studies suggest this can lead to less elaborative data and increased researcher dominance as the interviewer works harder to maintain engagement without visual feedback [[8]]. Conversely, other research indicates that the lack of visual pressure can create a safer psychological space, leading to greater openness and disclosure, particularly when discussing sensitive topics [[5,7]]. Participants may feel more relaxed and candid during a phone interview than they would in person, suggesting that rapport can be built differently in a voice-only context [[3]].

Another critical concept is **data richness and quality**. Researchers have long debated whether the data collected via digital means can match the depth and nuance of in-person data. The consensus from recent comparative studies appears to be that themes generated from remote interviews are largely comparable to those from face-to-face encounters [[7]]. However, there are important differences. Data from remote settings may be more concise, possibly due to environmental distractions or the structured nature of the digital platform [[7]]. The quality of data is highly dependent on the technology itself; unstable internet connections can disrupt conversation flow and compromise data depth [[7]], while features like automatic transcription and captioning in video conferencing tools can enhance data capture [[6]]. Furthermore, the medium can influence the type of data produced. For example, text-based interviews allow participants time to reflect before responding, potentially yielding more considered answers, while the immediacy of voice or video can capture more spontaneous reactions [[7]]. Ultimately, the concept of data quality in digital interviews moves beyond simply comparing modes to assessing the validity and relevance of the data produced *within* a given digital context, applying established criteria for rigor such as credibility, dependability, and transferability [[9]].

## Historical Development and Milestones

The evolution of digital interviewing is a story of gradual adaptation rather than revolutionary invention. While the modern proliferation of these methods is often dated to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, their roots extend much further back, marked by periods of cautious experimentation, incremental adoption, and persistent methodological debate. Understanding this history is crucial for contextualizing their current status and for appreciating the journey from niche application to mainstream research tool.

The earliest documented uses of telephone technology for social research can be traced back to the late 20th century. Seminal work in this area was conducted by Tausig and Freeman (1988) and Sturges & Hanrahan (2004), who performed some of the first systematic comparisons between telephone and face-to-face interviews [[5]]. Their research demonstrated that telephone interviews could yield rich, high-quality data and offered distinct advantages, such as increased participant privacy and reduced social desirability bias, which encouraged the disclosure of sensitive information [[5]]. Despite these promising findings, telephone interviewing failed to gain widespread acceptance in academic qualitative circles. It was often relegated to practical applications like market research and public opinion polling, while being largely ignored or dismissed in textbooks and scholarly discourse on qualitative methods [[5]]. Authors like Patton (2002) and Denzin & Lincoln (2005) gave the topic minimal attention, reflecting a broader methodological bias that privileged the face-to-face encounter as the purer form of qualitative inquiry [[5]]. This created a significant gap in the literature, leaving early pioneers to validate a method that was simultaneously innovative and under-theorized [[5]].

The advent of the internet and personal computing brought a new wave of possibilities. Platforms like Skype began to facilitate video conferencing, offering a potential bridge between the physical and digital worlds. Studies soon emerged exploring the use of video calls for qualitative data collection. Krouwel et al. (2019) noted that technical disruptions during Skype interviews could negatively affect conversation flow and data depth, highlighting the nascent stage of the technology [[7]]. Similarly, Vogl (2013) and Deakin & Wakefield (2014) contributed to the growing body of literature suggesting that digital interviews could produce data of comparable quality to in-person methods, laying the groundwork for future acceptance [[3]]. During this period, researchers began to articulate the unique benefits of video-mediated interviews, such as the preservation of visual cues for rapport-building and the ability to conduct cross-border research efficiently [[3]]. However, the adoption remained relatively slow, constrained by factors like limited bandwidth, the cost of hardware, and the general inertia of established research practices.

The true inflection point came with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The global lockdowns and travel restrictions made in-person data collection impossible or unethical for many fields, compelling a mass migration to digital platforms [[3]]. This crisis acted as a powerful accelerant, transforming previously optional or experimental technologies into essential research infrastructure. Studies conducted during this period, such as the three telephone-based projects in rural Bihar, India, demonstrated the urgent need for remote methods to continue vital research even under extreme duress [[2]]. The pandemic forced a pragmatic shift, where researchers had little choice but to adopt digital tools out of necessity. This widespread, albeit involuntary, adoption led to a massive expansion of real-world data on the effectiveness and challenges of digital interviews across diverse disciplines and global contexts. The result was a flood of new research documenting successful implementations, such as the use of WhatsApp audio calls in Ghana to study education technology, which proved cost-effective and accessible [[3]]. This sudden scale of application provided a wealth of empirical evidence that challenged long-held assumptions about the limitations of remote interviewing. The historical development, therefore, can be seen as a progression from peripheral use, to cautious exploration, to a sudden and decisive mainstreaming driven by external forces, setting the stage for a new era of qualitative inquiry defined by digital mediation.

## Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

The contemporary landscape of digital interviewing is characterized by a sophisticated array of methods and techniques that leverage advanced technologies to enhance every stage of the research process, from recruitment to analysis. Researchers today are no longer limited to basic telephony or simple video calls; instead, they operate within a complex ecosystem of specialized software and platforms designed to support the nuances of qualitative inquiry. This evolution has enabled new approaches to data collection and analysis, though it has also introduced new layers of complexity and reliance on technology.

A key technique involves the strategic selection of digital platforms based on the specific needs of the study and the context of the participants. For instance, in a study of teachers in Ghana, researchers chose WhatsApp audio calls over more common video conferencing tools because WhatsApp was widely available, cost-effective, and required lower bandwidth, making it accessible in areas with less stable internet connectivity [[3]]. This highlights a crucial principle: the "best" technology is not always the most feature-rich, but the most appropriate for the local conditions. Other platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Skype are frequently used for video interviews, offering features such as automatic recording, screen sharing, and real-time closed captioning, which can significantly aid the data collection and transcription processes [[6,11]]. For group discussions, platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams are adapted for virtual focus group discussions (FGDs), while dedicated online communities like Reddit and Facebook are used for asynchronous text-based FGDs [[4]]. This demonstrates a move towards hybrid methods, combining synchronous video sessions with asynchronous online discussions to maximize participant engagement and accessibility [[4]].

Beyond platform choice, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) represents a frontier in digital interviewing techniques. AI-driven tools are increasingly used to automate labor-intensive tasks like transcription, freeing up researchers to focus on analysis [[4]]. In one study, the software Otter.ai was used to transcribe expert interviews conducted via Zoom, streamlining the initial stages of data preparation [[11]]. Beyond transcription, NLP techniques are being applied to perform automated thematic analysis and sentiment analysis [[4]]. These tools can process large volumes of text to identify recurring themes and detect emotional tones, offering a quantitative lens through which to view qualitative data. This fusion of qualitative depth with computational power promises to enhance efficiency and uncover patterns that might be missed by manual review. However, it also introduces new methodological questions around algorithmic bias and the interpretive role of the human analyst.

The table below summarizes the key methods and techniques discussed in the provided literature, illustrating the diversity of approaches researchers are employing.

| Technique Category | Specific Method/Tool | Key Features and Applications | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interview Platform Selection** | WhatsApp Audio Calls | Cost-effective, low-bandwidth, widely used in Ghana for teacher interviews. | `[[3]]` |

| | Gamification | Emerging techniques like role-playing and digital storytelling used in virtual FGDs to enhance participant engagement. | `[[4]]` |

These techniques collectively signify a maturation of the field. Researchers are moving beyond simply replicating the in-person interview in a digital space and are beginning to experiment with novel methods tailored to the unique affordances of the technology. The use of visual mapping in virtual team meetings, for example, represents a creative adaptation of collaborative analysis that leverages the digital environment [[9]]. Similarly, the integration of gamification in virtual focus groups points towards a future where digital spaces are not just conduits for conversation but active environments for co-creation of knowledge [[4]]. However, this sophistication comes with a price. The reliance on specific software and algorithms requires new technical competencies from researchers and introduces vulnerabilities related to data security and platform dependency. The current state-of-the-art is thus a double-edged sword: it offers unprecedented capabilities for innovation and efficiency but demands a higher level of technical literacy and a more critical approach to the tools themselves.

## Comparative Analysis of Interview Modes

A central question in the literature on digital interviewing is how different modes—specifically, face-to-face, telephone, and video-conferenced interviews—compare in terms of their impact on the research process and outcomes. The evidence suggests that while all modes can successfully collect qualitative data, they do so in qualitatively different ways, influencing everything from participant talk patterns to the very nature of the relationship between researcher and participant. A comparative analysis reveals a trade-off between the richness of sensory information and the psychological safety afforded by different levels of anonymity.

One of the most significant points of comparison is **data volume and structure**. Several studies have found that remote interviews tend to produce more concise data. A scoping review analyzing 58 articles concluded that themes from remote methods are often more concise than those from in-person data [[7]]. This may be due to environmental distractions or the more structured nature of a mediated conversation [[7]]. A more granular study by MIWHQX (2008) provides specific metrics, finding that telephone interviews yielded less elaborative data than face-to-face interviews. In their subsample, telephone participants contributed 25 fewer minutes of talk overall, with shorter participant turn durations (31 seconds vs. 47 seconds) and more frequent questioning from the researcher, indicating a higher degree of researcher dominance [[8]]. This suggests that the absence of visual cues can make it harder for the researcher to read conversational flow, potentially leading to more probing and interrupting. In contrast, video interviews offer the potential for richer data capture through automatic recording and transcription, but can be hindered by technical issues like poor bandwidth, which disrupt conversation flow [[6,7]].

The second major axis of comparison is **participant rapport and comfort**. Here, the findings are more complex and often contradictory. On one hand, the physical distance inherent in telephone and video interviews can reduce social pressure and increase participant anonymity, creating a safer space for discussing sensitive topics [[5]]. Multiple sources report that participants feel more relaxed and open during remote interviews [[3,7]]. One participant, Chris, explicitly stated he felt safer sharing risky information remotely due to the physical distance [[7]]. This perceived safety can lead to greater disclosure of sensitive information, a key advantage of remote methods [[7]]. On the other hand, the lack of non-verbal cues in telephone interviews can impede the natural building of rapport. MIWHQX's (2008) study found that telephone interviews had fewer vocal acknowledgements (e.g., 'mm hm'), which are crucial for signaling engagement and encouraging elaboration [[8]]. This can make the researcher work harder to maintain rapport, sometimes resulting in a more formal, question-and-answer dynamic [[8]]. Video interviews attempt to mitigate this by preserving visual cues, but they can introduce their own anxieties, such as the feeling of being constantly watched, which may inhibit some participants [[6]].

The third dimension of comparison relates to **technical and logistical factors**. Face-to-face interviews are constrained by geography and require significant travel costs and time. Remote methods shatter these barriers, enabling wider geographic reach and greater scheduling flexibility [[3,6]]. This is particularly valuable in cross-border research or when working with geographically dispersed populations [[3]]. However, this expanded reach comes at a cost. Remote methods require reliable technology, including smartphones, computers, and stable internet connections, which introduces the risk of technical failures like dropped calls or frozen screens [[6,7]]. These disruptions can fragment the interview and affect data quality [[7]]. Furthermore, the digital divide—a participant's access to and proficiency with technology—can introduce significant selection bias, excluding those who are older, have lower incomes, or live in rural areas [[6]]. This makes careful consideration of technology requirements and potential biases a critical part of the design process for any remote study.

In summary, the choice of interview mode is not a neutral technical decision but a deliberate methodological one with profound implications. Face-to-face remains a powerful method for building deep rapport and capturing subtle non-verbal cues, but at a high logistical cost. Telephone interviews offer unparalleled accessibility and psychological safety for sensitive topics, but may sacrifice data elaboration. Video interviews promise a middle ground, combining accessibility with visual engagement, but are vulnerable to technical instability and may not be suitable for all personality types. The optimal choice depends entirely on the research goals, the topic, the population, and the resources available. The literature strongly suggests that a mixed-methods approach, using different modes strategically for different parts of a study, may offer the greatest flexibility and validity.

## Challenges and Open Problems

Despite the proven utility and increasing prevalence of digital interviews, their implementation is fraught with significant challenges that span ethical, technical, and methodological domains. These issues are not merely technical glitches but fundamental problems that can compromise the integrity of the research, the well-being of participants, and the validity of the findings. Addressing these open problems is paramount for the responsible advancement of digital qualitative inquiry.

Ethical challenges are perhaps the most extensively documented area of concern. The very nature of digital data collection amplifies risks related to privacy and confidentiality. The use of digital platforms for recording interviews necessitates robust strategies for data storage and security [[10]]. Researchers must grapple with the complexities of ensuring informed consent in a virtual environment, where verbal consent may be used for telephone interviews, and electronic means for video calls [[2,6]]. A critical issue highlighted in the literature is the difficulty of managing data after the study's completion. Research data protection officers note that researchers often struggle with defining retention timelines and locating all copies of distributed data across cloud services and backups, leading to prolonged storage of identifiable information [[10]]. This problem is compounded by institutional pressures to publish and a lack of formal processes for secure data deletion [[10]]. The legal landscape adds another layer of complexity, with stringent regulations like the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposing strict requirements on the handling of personal data [[10]]. Failure to comply can have severe legal and reputational consequences. Institutional support for navigating these legal and ethical complexities varies widely, with many researchers lacking access to formal training or Data Management Plans (DMPs), placing the entire burden of compliance on the individual researcher [[10]].

Technical challenges present a parallel set of obstacles. The most immediate and frequently cited problem is the unreliability of technology itself. Unstable internet connectivity, particularly a major issue in peri-urban and rural regions, can cause call drops, audio-video desynchronization, and overall poor call quality, severely disrupting the flow of the interview and compromising data depth [[3,7]]. Even with stable connections, researchers face challenges in moderating the virtual environment. In video conferences, it can be difficult to manage turn-taking and ensure all participants are heard, especially in larger groups [[6]]. The moderator must actively compensate for the lack of natural non-verbal cues for turn-taking, requiring a more deliberate and forceful style of facilitation. Furthermore, the technology itself can become a barrier to rapport. The "on-screen" presence in video calls can be anxiety-inducing for some participants, hindering their ability to speak freely, while the flatness of a telephone line can make it difficult for a researcher to pick up on vocal cues of distress or discomfort, making it harder to provide timely support [[6]].

Methodological challenges are more subtle but equally important. Perhaps the most significant is the issue of **selection bias**. The requirement for participants to have access to a smartphone, computer, and stable internet connection creates a digital divide that systematically excludes certain populations [[6]]. Factors such as older age, lower income, and rural location are correlated with reduced participation in video interviews, meaning the resulting sample may not be representative of the target population [[6]]. This is a critical threat to the generalizability of findings and must be acknowledged and addressed through sampling strategies like snowball sampling or by acknowledging the limitations in reporting [[3]]. Another methodological concern is the potential for data distortion. While remote settings can encourage honesty, they can also be prone to environmental distractions, such as background noise or interruptions from family members, which can fragment responses and affect data quality [[6,7]]. Finally, there is a challenge related to the researcher's own reflexivity and skill set. Conducting an effective digital interview requires a different set of skills than in-person interviewing, including technical troubleshooting, managing a virtual room, and adapting conversational styles to the medium. Without adequate training and experience, the quality of the data can suffer.

## Future Research Directions

As the field of digital interviewing matures, a series of clear and pressing research gaps remain, pointing toward several promising future directions. The current body of literature, while extensive, is often descriptive and comparative, focusing on *what* has been observed rather than *why* it occurs or *how* to best intervene. To fully realize the potential of these methods and mitigate their inherent challenges, future research must adopt a more sophisticated, interdisciplinary, and solution-oriented approach.

First and foremost, there is a critical need for more **longitudinal studies and experimental designs**. The majority of existing research consists of single-point-in-time comparisons between modes, which cannot account for the learning curve involved in digital interviewing or the cumulative effects of repeated interactions in a virtual space. Future research should employ longitudinal designs to track changes in data quality, rapport, and participant comfort over multiple interviews. Experimental designs could systematically test interventions aimed at overcoming known challenges, such as comparing different rapport-building techniques in video versus telephone interviews or testing the efficacy of specific technologies for mitigating the negative impacts of poor internet connectivity.

Second, future research must move beyond a simplistic binary comparison of modes and instead focus on **contextualized, multimodal approaches**. The future of qualitative research likely lies not in choosing one perfect mode, but in strategically combining them. Research is needed to develop and evaluate hybrid methodologies that integrate face-to-face, telephone, and video elements to optimize data collection. For example, a study could begin with an in-person session to build initial rapport, followed by telephone interviews for sensitive topics, and conclude with a video meeting for data validation. Future research should also explore the use of emerging technologies, such as virtual reality (VR) for immersive data collection or advanced AI for real-time analysis of conversational dynamics, to push the boundaries of what is possible.

Third, a significant research gap exists in the area of **methodological guidelines and training**. The current literature highlights a lack of formal training and standardized protocols for digital interviewing [[10]]. Future work should focus on developing comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines that cover the entire research lifecycle—from designing the study and selecting the appropriate technology, to obtaining ethical approval, conducting the interview, analyzing the data, and securely archiving it. This includes creating standardized checklists for data management plans (DMPs) and establishing best practices for reflexive journaling when using digital tools. Developing curricula and training modules for graduate students and early-career researchers would be a vital contribution to the field, helping to professionalize the practice of digital interviewing.

Fourth, the intersection of digital methods and ethics requires deeper investigation. While existing research has identified key ethical challenges, there is a need for more work on **developing and validating ethical tools and frameworks**. This includes creating validated instruments for assessing the psychological impact of participating in remote versus in-person interviews. Research is needed to develop practical, user-friendly consent forms and privacy notices for different digital platforms. Furthermore, the application of legal frameworks like GDPR to specific research scenarios needs to be explored in greater depth, with a focus on clarifying the responsibilities of researchers versus institutions and data protection officers [[10]]. This work is essential for building a more robust ethical foundation for the field.

Finally, future research must prioritize **addressing the digital divide**. The exclusion of marginalized populations due to unequal access to technology is a fundamental threat to the validity of digital qualitative research [[6]]. More research is needed to develop and test innovative sampling and recruitment strategies to reach these hard-to-reach groups. This could involve partnerships with community organizations, providing technology and training to participants, or using modes that are intentionally designed for low-resource settings. Additionally, research should investigate the long-term societal impacts of relying on digital methods, considering how they might shape access to research and representation in the broader academic discourse. By tackling these challenges head-on, the research community can work towards a future where digital interviewing is not only a convenient alternative but a truly equitable, valid, and transformative method for understanding the human experience.
