## Introduction: The Enduring Relevance of Qualitative Inquiry

Qualitative research represents a fundamental pillar of inquiry across numerous academic disciplines, from the social sciences and humanities to health care, education, and business. Its primary objective is to explore and understand complex human phenomena in their natural settings, seeking to uncover the depth and richness of lived experience rather than merely quantifying it [[9]]. Within this broad field, focus group discussion (FGD) has emerged as one of the most widely used and influential data collection methods. First developed in the 1940s, FGDs are defined as a qualitative technique that involves guided discussions with a small group of participants to collect data on a specific topic under the direction of a trained moderator [[1,3,8]]. This method capitalizes on the dynamic interplay of group interaction, which can generate insights into how individuals co-construct meaning, negotiate opinions, and influence one another—a dimension that individual interviews cannot capture [[3,5]]. The enduring relevance of FGDs lies in their ability to provide nuanced, contextualized data that can reveal underlying beliefs, values, and social dynamics related to a given subject.

The motivation for employing qualitative methods like FGDs often arises when little prior empirical data exists on a topic or when existing quantitative data requires deeper exploration to understand its context and meaning [[1]]. In health research, for example, FGDs are indispensable tools for understanding patient perspectives on treatments, exploring barriers to medication adherence, assessing healthcare needs, and evaluating program effectiveness [[2,5,9]]. Similarly, they are employed extensively in marketing to gauge consumer preferences, in political science to study public opinion and trust, and in education to evaluate curriculum implementation [[3,4]]. The versatility of FGDs allows them to be applied to an extraordinarily wide range of topics, including COPD care bundle implementation, post-Brexit political trust, technology use, and climate communication, demonstrating their utility across diverse fields [[4]].

This review paper aims to systematically synthesize the current state of knowledge regarding qualitative research and FGD methodology. It is structured to move from foundational principles to contemporary applications and challenges, providing a comprehensive overview for researchers and practitioners. The objectives of this review are threefold: first, to establish a clear definition and conceptual framework for FGDs by examining their core components and distinguishing features; second, to trace the historical development of the method from its origins to its modern-day applications; and third, to critically analyze the current state-of-the-art techniques, major applications, and associated ethical considerations. By synthesizing findings from recent literature, this review will identify key strengths, weaknesses, and open problems in the field, ultimately charting future research directions. The ultimate goal is to present a rigorous and insightful analysis that not only informs but also stimulates further innovation in qualitative inquiry.

## Key Concepts and Foundational Principles of Focus Group Methodology

At its core, a focus group discussion is a qualitative research technique designed to elicit rich, interactive data through a facilitated conversation [[1]]. It is characterized by several key elements that distinguish it from other forms of data collection. A typical FGD consists of a small number of participants, usually between six and ten, who share experiential knowledge relevant to a pre-determined topic [[2,3]]. The session is led by a skilled facilitator, known as a moderator, whose role is to guide the discussion using an open-ended discussion guide while simultaneously managing the group's social dynamics [[3,5]]. Data is primarily collected through audiotaping or videotaping of the session, followed by verbatim transcription, allowing for detailed thematic analysis [[2]]. The defining feature of the FGD is the interactive dialogue among participants, which generates data not only from individual perspectives but also from the emergent group dynamics and the interactions between them [[1,9]].

The purpose of an FGD is to delve beyond surface-level responses to understand the substance of what people say, think, and, crucially, why they hold those views [[1]]. This is achieved by creating an environment where participants can build upon each other's ideas, a phenomenon termed 'piggybacking' [[2]]. This process can lead to the emergence of new insights and a deeper understanding of complex issues than would be possible in separate interviews. Jennifer Cyr highlights three distinct sources of data within an FGD: the individual perspectives of each participant, the collective or group perspective that emerges from the interaction, and the dynamic relationship between these two levels [[1]]. This tripartite view underscores the unique value of the group setting. The research question serves as the central guiding force for the entire process, dictating the study design, participant selection criteria, the structure of the discussion guide, and the analytical approach [[1]].

Despite its power, the FGD method is not without significant challenges. The "human factor" is arguably the most critical challenge, encompassing a range of potential issues that can compromise data quality if not managed properly [[1]]. These include groupthink, where the desire for consensus leads participants to suppress dissenting opinions; hostility or conflict among participants; and passivity, where some members remain silent throughout the discussion [[1]]. Another common issue is the emergence of dominant individuals who steer the conversation, potentially marginalizing quieter voices [[2]]. Furthermore, the unstructured nature of group interaction can lead to a drift away from the topic, making careful moderation essential [[5]]. Logistical challenges also abound, including the time-consuming processes of recruitment, scheduling, and analysis, as well as the high costs associated with venue rental and transcription services [[6]]. Finally, the self-selected nature of the sample limits the generalizability of findings, a limitation inherent to all non-probability sampling methods [[2]]. Addressing these challenges requires meticulous planning, highly skilled moderators, and robust methodological strategies to ensure the validity and reliability of the research outcomes.

## Historical Development and Milestones in Focus Group Research

The history of the focus group discussion is deeply intertwined with the development of American sociology and social psychology in the mid-twentieth century. The method's origins can be traced back to the early 1940s at Columbia University's Bureau of Applied Social Research (BASR) [[8]]. It was here that the sociologist Robert K. Merton and his colleague, Patricia Kendall, developed what they called the "focused interview" as part of a broader effort to develop middle-range theory—empirically-grounded theories that bridge abstract concepts and observable phenomena [[8]]. The immediate impetus for this work came from the Lazarsfeld-Stanton Program Analyzer ("Little Annie"), a device used during World War II to measure audience reactions to radio propaganda broadcasts [[8]]. While "Little Annie" could quantify emotional responses, it could not explain the reasons behind them. To address this gap, Merton and Kendall pioneered follow-up group discussions to probe the "why" behind the initial reactions, thus laying the groundwork for the modern FGD [[8]].

In their seminal 1946 paper published in the *American Journal of Sociology*, Merton and Kendall outlined four novel features of their focused interview method, which distinguished it from traditional one-on-one interviews and survey techniques [[8]]. These features were: (1) the assumption that participants possess direct, experiential knowledge about a specific social situation; (2) the interviewer's possession of pre-analyzed hypotheses about the situation; (3) the preparation of questions in advance based on these hypotheses; and (4) the dual goal of both testing existing theories and generating new ones through the data collected [[8]]. This formulation established the FGD as a powerful tool for exploratory and theory-generating research. However, a significant milestone in the method's history was also its greatest threat: Merton's lamentation over the "obliteration by incorporation" [[8]]. He feared that the sophisticated theoretical intent of his original method would be lost as it was adopted and adapted for more commercial purposes.

Indeed, the FGD was quickly appropriated by market research firms for use in product concept testing and advertising evaluation [[5,6]]. While this adoption led to widespread popularity and methodological refinement in applied settings, it also distanced the practice from its academic roots. Merton's vision of using group discussions for rigorous social science inquiry was largely supplanted by a focus on efficiency and predictive validity for corporate clients. The publication of Merton and Kendall's influential book, *The Focused Interview*, was delayed until 1956, by which time simplified photocopied versions of their work were already circulating widely, contributing to the dilution of its original intent [[8]]. Despite this shift, the method continued to evolve within the academy. In the 1990s, scholars like Jaber F. M. Gaskell and Myra J. Strober began to formally theorize the dynamics of group interaction, providing a more robust foundation for analyzing FGD data [[2]]. More recently, the method has seen a resurgence in its original theoretical capacity, particularly through its application in realist evaluation, a methodology that uses FGDs not just for description but for causal reasoning and theory development [[8]]. This historical trajectory—from its genesis in academic theory-building to its commercialization and subsequent re-embrace by the social sciences—highlights the remarkable adaptability and enduring power of the focus group discussion as a research tool.

## State-of-the-Art Methods and Innovations in Practice

The landscape of focus group methodology has evolved significantly since its inception, moving beyond the traditional face-to-face format to incorporate digital technologies and specialized designs tailored to specific research contexts. One of the most prominent innovations is the rise of online video focus groups (VFGs), which gained substantial traction due to the logistical constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic [[10]]. Research comparing VFGs to their face-to-face counterparts reveals both similarities and distinct differences in interaction patterns. For instance, a 2024 study found that while both formats reached consensus on most topics, face-to-face groups exhibited higher levels of spontaneous interaction and support, whereas online groups conversed more sequentially, often relying on moderator-controlled electronic "hand raise" functions to manage turn-taking [[10]]. The same study noted that dominance by a single participant was observed in a face-to-face group but not in any of the three online groups, suggesting that the virtual environment may alter power dynamics [[10]]. Further adaptations have included asynchronous online focus groups (AOFGs), which allow participants to contribute to a discussion over an extended period, proving useful for investigating community attitudes toward sensitive topics like biotechnology in food production [[11]]. The increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into daily life has also influenced online group dynamics, with one study observing participants in online focus groups opting to respond via chat boxes, likely influenced by their interactions with AI assistants [[11]].

Beyond technological shifts, there has been a push towards more sophisticated and longitudinal designs. Christian Baden and colleagues introduced the concept of "Serial Focus Groups," a design involving repeated sessions with the same participants over time, allowing researchers to track changes in perspectives and attitudes [[4]]. This approach offers a way to overcome the limitations of cross-sectional data and provides a richer understanding of processes of change. In addition to evolving formats, the specialization of FGDs for particular populations and contexts has become increasingly important. A landmark study conducted in Germany on the development of electronic personal health records (EPHRs) highlighted the need for highly tailored approaches in health-related research [[5]]. The study found that standard social science guidelines for group size (8–20) were too large for patient groups, who preferred smaller sizes of 4–7 participants to facilitate trust and sharing [[5]]. Furthermore, moderator characteristics were found to be critical; moderators deeply immersed in the technical topic enhanced credibility and elicited more concrete requirements for EPHR development [[5]]. The study also emphasized practical considerations, such as the importance of recruiting patients through face-to-face contact rather than written invitations and the need for longer introduction rounds to build rapport with patient groups compared to clinicians [[5]].

Perhaps the most profound innovation lies in the philosophical and theoretical application of the method. As previously noted, the revival of realist evaluation has shifted the purpose of FGDs from simple data collection to theory development [[8]]. This approach uses group deliberations not just to describe a phenomenon but to test and refine CMO (Context-Mechanism-Outcome) configurations, thereby explaining *how*, *for whom*, and *in what circumstances* an intervention works [[8]]. This represents a move up the evidence ladder, transforming the FGD from a descriptive tool into a mechanism for causal inference. Concurrently, a growing body of literature has emerged that critiques the universal applicability of mainstream FGDs and advocates for culturally congruent alternatives. Sista Circle Methodology (SCM), developed by Dr. Latoya Johnson, is a prime example of this trend [[16]]. Designed specifically for Black women, SCM is rooted in their epistemologies and emphasizes non-verbal communication, empowerment, and the researcher-as-participant to create a safe and affirming space for dialogue [[16,17]]. These innovations—from digital formats and longitudinal designs to specialized health applications and culturally-specific methodologies—demonstrate that FGDs are not a static method but a dynamic and adaptable toolkit capable of addressing a wide array of contemporary research questions.

## Applications Across Diverse Fields and Contexts

The versatility of focus group discussion methodology has led to its widespread adoption across a multitude of disciplines and sectors. Its ability to generate rich, contextual data makes it particularly valuable for exploratory research, program evaluation, and understanding complex social behaviors. In the realm of health and medical research, FGDs are a cornerstone method. They are routinely used to explore patient experiences with chronic illnesses like colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes, gather perspectives from healthcare professionals on new technologies such as electronic personal health records, and assess the implementation of clinical care bundles [[2,5,9]]. A notable German study exemplifies this application, conducting 21 FGDs with various stakeholder groups—including patients, physicians, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals—to co-develop requirements for an EPHR system [[5]]. Beyond direct patient care, FGDs are instrumental in public health, helping to understand factors influencing medication adherence, inform the design of mental health interventions, and evaluate community health programs [[3,11]].

In the social sciences, FGDs have proven invaluable for studying public opinion, social cohesion, and policy impacts. Political scientists have used them to investigate political trust in the aftermath of major events like Brexit, exploring the nuances of public sentiment that might be missed by quantitative surveys [[4]]. In urban planning and community development, FGDs are employed for needs assessment and program improvement, allowing researchers to engage directly with community members to identify priorities and co-create solutions [[2,12]]. A special issue of the *International Journal of Qualitative Methods* dedicated to accessibility and inclusion highlights the use of FGDs in community-based participatory research (CBPR) with marginalized pediatric populations in the United States, focusing on racial and ethnic minority youth [[12]]. In this context, FGDs are often combined with other methods like photovoice and advisory boards to gather diverse community perspectives and facilitate structured discussions [[12]].

The business and technology sectors have long leveraged FGDs for market research and user-centered design. Originally popularized by pioneers in market research, FGDs are used to explore customer preferences, test concepts for new products or services, and understand consumer behavior [[3,6]]. In the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), FGDs are used to study technology use and usability, as demonstrated by research presented in the *Canadian Journal of Political Science* on technology's role in political engagement [[4]]. More recently, FGDs have been applied to cutting-edge topics like climate communication and biotechnology, where they help researchers understand public attitudes and perceptions of risk and benefit [[4,11]]. The table below provides a summary of FGD applications across several key domains.

| **Research Domain** | **Specific Application Example** | **Target Population** | **Methodological Approach** | **Source Citation** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Healthcare** | Co-design of an Electronic Personal Health Record (EPHR) | Patients, Physicians, Pharmacists, Other Healthcare Professionals | Tailored FGDs with co-moderation and prioritization exercises | `[[5]]` |
| **Political Science** | Study of political trust after Brexit | General Public | English FGDs to explore nuanced public sentiment | `[[4]]` |
| **Community Development** | Needs assessment for marginalized youth | Racial/Ethnic Minority Youth, Parents | CBPR combining FGDs with Photovoice and Advisory Boards | `[[12]]` |
| **Disability Studies** | Co-development of Wellbeing Checklist | Children with Disabilities, Parents | Multi-modal methods (drawing, role-playing) with peer researchers with disabilities | `[[15]]` |
| **Public Health** | Mental health challenges among university students | University Students | FGDs to examine situational factors in a post-pandemic era | `[[11]]` |
| **Market Research** | Technology use in focus group research | Political Scientists, Researchers | Exploration of digital tools and methodologies in HCI | `[[4]]` |

These examples illustrate that while the core mechanics of an FGD remain consistent, its application is highly malleable. The success of the method hinges on adapting its design, conduct, and analysis to fit the specific research question, target population, and theoretical framework, cementing its status as an indispensable tool in the modern researcher's arsenal.

## Critical Challenges, Ethical Considerations, and Open Problems

Despite its widespread use and adaptability, focus group methodology is fraught with significant challenges and ethical complexities that demand careful consideration. The most frequently cited challenge is the "human factor"—the unpredictable and powerful influence of group dynamics on the data generated [[1]]. Issues such as groupthink, where the pressure for harmony leads to conformity and the suppression of dissenting views, and the tendency for dominant individuals to monopolize the conversation, can distort the results and prevent a full range of perspectives from emerging [[1,2]]. Managing these dynamics requires a highly skilled moderator who can foster inclusivity, encourage quieter members to speak, and gently redirect the discussion when it veers off-topic [[5]]. Another practical challenge is recruitment and logistics. Recruiting a suitable mix of participants can be difficult and time-consuming, especially for studies targeting specific demographics or conditions [[3]]. This is compounded by the high organizational effort and cost associated with renting venues, transcribing lengthy recordings, and analyzing the resulting data [[5,6]].

Ethical considerations in FGDs are more complex than in one-to-one interviews due to the group setting. Consent is a primary concern. Because the interaction is inherently unpredictable, it is impossible to fully disclose all potential risks to participants before the session begins [[7]]. Participants may find it difficult to revoke consent once the discussion has started, and the line between giving blanket consent to participate and consenting to every specific utterance made by others becomes blurred [[7]]. Confidentiality presents an even greater challenge. While researchers can promise not to share identifying information, they have limited control over what participants choose to disclose about one another or about themselves, especially in small, tight-knit communities where rich narrative details can lead to deductive disclosure [[7]]. This internal confidentiality is particularly difficult to guarantee. The potential for harm is also heightened in a group setting. Discussing sensitive topics like trauma, illness, or political conflict can cause distress, embarrassment, or stigmatization [[7]]. However, the shared experience can also be therapeutic and validating, presenting a delicate balance for researchers who must avoid causing harm while not silencing marginalized voices [[7]]. Mitigation strategies include establishing clear ground rules at the outset, skilled moderation to manage the group's emotional tone, and conducting post-group debriefings to check in on participants [[7]].

A set of interconnected open problems remains a significant barrier to the field's progress. A persistent issue is the lack of standardized definitions and reporting standards for many qualitative methods, including FGDs. This variability makes it difficult to compare studies, replicate findings, and synthesize evidence systematically [[12]]. There is a pressing need for more rigorous evaluation of the methods themselves, particularly in terms of their impact on the final results. For instance, while the *RAMESES quality standards* exist for realist evaluation, they do not yet offer specific guidance on differentiating between the use of individual interviews and FGDs, nor do they provide stopping rules for data collection like theoretical saturation, which is rejected in favor of iterative mixed-methods triangulation in realist FGDs [[8]]. Finally, a critical area for future research is the development of more inclusive practices. People with disabilities, for example, are often excluded from research due to inaccessible venues, a lack of clear protocols for accommodations, and ableist assumptions about their capacity to participate meaningfully [[11,13]]. While innovative methods like the use of peer researchers with disabilities and multi-modal techniques show promise, there is still much work to be done to ensure that qualitative research is truly accessible and equitable for all participants [[14,15]].

## Future Directions and Synthesis of Key Findings

In conclusion, this review has provided a comprehensive overview of qualitative research and focus group discussion methodology, tracing its evolution from a niche academic tool to a ubiquitous method with diverse applications. The analysis reveals a field characterized by both remarkable resilience and ongoing transformation. The core strength of the FGD lies in its unique ability to capture the dynamics of social interaction, yielding data on how meanings are co-constructed and negotiated among participants—a dimension that individual interviews cannot replicate [[1,3]]. This strength has ensured its enduring relevance across disciplines, from health and medicine to politics and marketing, and has allowed it to be adapted to new contexts and technologies [[2,4,9]].

However, this review has also identified several key weaknesses and areas for future development. A primary weakness is the vulnerability of FGDs to unmanaged group dynamics, such as groupthink and dominance, which can skew results [[1,2]]. While skilled moderation can mitigate these issues, they highlight the subjective nature of the data collection process. A more fundamental challenge is the lack of standardized reporting and evaluation criteria, which impedes meta-research and systematic reviews [[12]]. Furthermore, the ethical landscape of FGDs, particularly concerning consent, confidentiality, and risk of harm in a group setting, remains complex and underdeveloped [[7]]. The open problem of ensuring the inclusion and accessibility of marginalized populations, such as people with disabilities, represents a critical frontier for the field, demanding not just procedural adjustments but a paradigm shift towards socially just and empowering research practices [[11,14]].

Looking forward, the future of FGD methodology appears to be heading in several promising directions. First, the integration of technology is likely to continue, with hybrid models blending face-to-face and online interaction becoming more common. This will necessitate further research into the differential effects of these formats on group dynamics, data quality, and participant comfort. Second, the field must move towards greater methodological pluralism and cultural specificity. The rise of alternatives like Sista Circle Methodology demonstrates a growing recognition that a one-size-fits-all approach to qualitative inquiry is inadequate [[16,17]]. Future research should focus on developing, validating, and disseminating a wider range of culturally congruent and context-specific methods that honor diverse epistemologies. Third, the emphasis on rigor must extend beyond procedural fidelity to include more robust evaluation of the actual impact of the research process itself on the outcomes. This includes adopting frameworks like realist evaluation to explain *how* and *why* interventions work, moving beyond mere description to causal explanation [[8]]. Finally, the imperative for inclusivity must be translated into tangible action. This involves actively dismantling barriers to participation for marginalized groups, supporting disabled researchers in leadership roles, and embedding principles of equity and justice into every stage of the research lifecycle [[14,15]].

To sum up, the focus group discussion remains a vital and evolving method in the qualitative researcher's toolkit. Its past is marked by a journey from academic theory to commercial application and back again, imbuing it with a unique blend of theoretical depth and practical utility. Its present is characterized by rapid innovation in digital formats, specialized designs, and alternative paradigms. And its future depends on our collective commitment to navigating its inherent challenges with greater rigor, ethical foresight, and a steadfast dedication to creating knowledge that is not only valid but also just and empowering for all participants.
