      "content": "The construction industry stands as one of the most hazardous sectors globally, consistently reporting high rates of fatal and non-fatal injuries [[9,14]]. In 2021, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that while construction accounts for only 6% of the nation's workforce, it was the site of 1 in every 5 workplace fatalities [[14]]. The rate of fatalities remains stubbornly high, with an estimated death occurring approximately every nine minutes on a global scale [[14]]. These alarming statistics are compounded by the significant economic burden of occupational injuries, which can account for up to 3% of total project costs and as much as 10% of labor expenses in the United States alone [[14]]. Despite advancements in safety protocols and technology, the industry has struggled to achieve sustained reductions in its fatality rate over decades, particularly in regions like China where stagnation persists [[14]]. This persistent danger is driven by a confluence of factors inherent to the nature of construction work: dynamic, unstructured environments; frequent changes in tasks and personnel; exposure to heavy machinery; and working at heights. The industry's employment growth, even through the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, underscores the urgent need for more effective and scalable safety solutions [[9]].\n\nIn response to these challenges, the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry is undergoing a profound digital transformation, moving towards Industry 4.0 paradigms that leverage advanced technologies to enhance efficiency, quality, and safety [[10,17]]. Within this context, computer vision (CV) has emerged as a powerful tool with the potential to revolutionize safety science and management. CV systems can process vast streams of visual data from cameras, drones, and wearable devices to provide real-time insights and automated monitoring capabilities that were previously unattainable [[14]]. By enabling continuous, objective surveillance of jobsites, these technologies can help identify hazards, enforce compliance with safety protocols, analyze worker behavior, and prevent accidents before they occur [[6,9]]. The integration of CV with other emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Building Information Modeling (BIM), and artificial intelligence (AI) promises a holistic approach to safety management that can augment human oversight and drive cultural shifts toward greater transparency and proactive risk mitigation [[10,21]].\n\nThis review paper provides a comprehensive systematic literature analysis of the application of computer vision technologies for safety science and management in the construction industry. It is designed to serve as a critical resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers by tracing the evolution of these technologies, analyzing their current state-of-the-art methods, evaluating their real-world applications and limitations, and identifying key gaps and future research directions. The motivation for this review stems from the fragmented nature of existing literature. While numerous studies have explored specific aspects of AI in construction, there is a notable lack of integrated reviews that synthesize findings across different safety domains, methodologies, and ethical considerations [[7,14]]. Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological advancement means that many foundational techniques have been superseded, yet their historical contributions remain crucial for understanding the field's trajectory. This review aims to fill that gap by offering a structured, critical examination of the entire landscape, from early image processing approaches to the latest deep learning architectures. Its objectives are threefold: first, to establish a chronological framework for the development of CV in construction safety; second, to critically assess the performance, strengths, and weaknesses of contemporary CV models and their practical implementation; and third, to synthesize the findings into actionable recommendations for future research and responsible deployment."

      "heading": "Historical Development and Methodological Evolution",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The journey of computer vision in construction safety has been characterized by a distinct methodological evolution, transitioning from simple, rule-based systems to complex, adaptive deep learning models. This progression reflects broader trends in artificial intelligence, but with unique adaptations required to address the challenging and uncontrolled nature of construction sites. The historical timeline reveals a clear shift from computationally efficient classical algorithms to powerful, albeit data-hungry, neural networks, each phase marked by distinct milestones and a corresponding expansion in what could be monitored and analyzed. Foundational studies from the early 2010s laid the groundwork for modern systems by introducing robust feature extraction techniques capable of handling the complexities of construction imagery [[1,17,22]].\n\nThe pre-deep learning era was dominated by classical computer vision techniques that relied on engineered features and traditional machine learning classifiers. One of the most influential methods was the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), often paired with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This approach proved highly effective for detecting humans and equipment. For instance, a seminal study by Park and Brilakis in 2012 demonstrated the use of HOG combined with Hue-Saturation (HS) color features to automatically detect workers and equipment from video streams, achieving impressive accuracies of 98.83% for standing workers, 82.10% for excavators, and 84.88% for dump trucks on a dataset collected from five real-world projects [[22]]. Similarly, cascade classifiers were found to be effective for the specific task of hardhat detection, providing accurate and rapid results in indoor environments [[3]]. These early systems, however, had significant limitations. Their performance was highly sensitive to environmental conditions such as uncontrolled illumination, occlusion, and cluttered backgrounds, which are ubiquitous on construction sites [[17,22]]. They also lacked the ability to generalize well to new scenarios not covered in their training data, necessitating extensive manual tuning and feature engineering for each new application.\n\nThe mid-2010s marked a pivotal turning point with the widespread adoption of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs offered a paradigm shift by automating the feature extraction process, allowing models to learn relevant representations directly from raw pixel data. This led to a dramatic increase in accuracy and robustness. A key milestone was the introduction of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) series of object detectors, which provided a new balance between speed and accuracy, making real-time applications feasible [[24]]. Studies began to emerge showcasing the power of CNNs for a variety of safety-critical tasks. For example, a 2018 study proposed a deep hybrid learning model integrating CNNs with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to detect unsafe behaviors, demonstrating the potential of combining spatial features from CNNs with temporal information from LSTMs [[1,17]]. Another study successfully used a CNN-based model for safety guardrail detection via transfer learning, highlighting the efficiency gains from leveraging pre-trained models [[17]]. During this period, research also began to explore multi-modal sensing, such as using depth imaging and 3D skeleton modeling with Kinect™ for more nuanced human behavior recognition [[1]].\n\nThe current state-of-the-art is defined by the dominance of deep learning, particularly large-scale transformer-based models and multi-task frameworks. Modern object detectors like YOLOv8 and its successors represent the cutting edge, offering superior performance and flexibility [[4,24]]. YOLOv8, for instance, introduced an anchor-free decoupled head and a C2f module, enhancing both accuracy and training efficiency [[24]]. This evolution is exemplified by a study that developed a multi-task intelligent monitoring system using YOLOv8 to simultaneously perform object detection, segmentation, and pose estimation, showcasing a move away from single-task models toward unified platforms [[4]]. Concurrently, there is a growing emphasis on generating synthetic data using game engines like Unity to overcome the scarcity of real-world examples for rare but critical events like worker falls, thereby improving model generalization and safety during validation [[5]]. This progression from handcrafted features to learned representations and now to multi-modal, synthetic-data-driven deep learning marks a continuous drive to build systems that are not only more accurate but also more adaptable and context-aware, bringing the promise of autonomous safety management closer to reality.\n\n| **Methodological Era** | **Key Techniques** | **Representative Studies / Models** | **Primary Strengths** | **Primary Weaknesses** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Pre-Deep Learning (c. 2010-2015)** | Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Cascade Classifiers, Color-Based Segmentation | Park & Brilakis (2012) [[22]], Seo et al.

      "heading": "Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Performance Benchmarks",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The current landscape of computer vision for construction safety is overwhelmingly dominated by deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are the most frequently cited model type in recent reviews [[21]]. Within the CNN family, object detection models have become the cornerstone of safety monitoring systems due to their ability to simultaneously identify and locate objects of interest within an image. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) series has emerged as a leading architecture for real-time applications, with each successive version pushing the boundaries of speed and accuracy [[24]]. Studies frequently employ YOLOv3, YOLOv5, and the more recent YOLOv8 for tasks ranging from personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance to fall detection [[16,21]]. The versatility of these models is evident in their successful adaptation for various sub-tasks. For example, a lightweight network based on GhostNet was shown to outperform heavier models like YOLOX-L and EfficientDet-D5 in helmet-wearing detection, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 93.5% at 42 frames per second (FPS) [[23]]. Other advanced models include those incorporating transformer components, such as the hybrid HCNN algorithm that combines HOG with CNNs for multi-camera tracking, and the development of novel backbones like Programmable Gradient Information (PGI) in YOLOv9 and Gather-and-Distribute mechanisms in Gold-YOLO [[15,24]].\n\nThe performance of these state-of-the-art models is rigorously benchmarked against a growing number of publicly available and custom-built datasets. Public datasets like SHEL5K, Roboflow Hard Hat Workers, CHV, MOCS, and SODA have become standard benchmarks, facilitating comparative analysis across different research groups [[4,11,21]]. However, a critical finding from the literature is that the choice of evaluation metric and the characteristics of the dataset significantly influence performance outcomes. While many studies report high mAP scores, often exceeding 90-95%, these figures can be misleading if not contextualized properly [[11,20]]. For example, a study using YOLOv8x for PPE detection on the CHV dataset achieved a high mAP@50 of 0.929, but a lower mAP@50-95 of 0.506, indicating poorer performance on more stringent IoU thresholds [[11]]. Furthermore, the quality and diversity of datasets are major concerns. A systematic cataloging effort identified 51 public datasets but highlighted significant gaps in coverage of real-world conditions, annotation quality, and representativeness, which can lead to biased or poorly performing models [[12]]. This is corroborated by studies showing that models trained on idealized or limited data often fail when deployed in the messy reality of a live construction site [[16]].\n\nPerformance varies dramatically depending on the specific safety task. Fall detection, for instance, remains a notoriously difficult problem. One study using a YOLOv8-based system reported a fall detection recall of only 0.45 and an overall accuracy of 0.62, far below the levels required for a reliable safety system [[16]]. The authors attributed this low performance to the reliance on a simple bounding box aspect ratio heuristic (width ≥ 2 × height), which is prone to failure under oblique camera angles and poor lighting [[16]]. In contrast, PPE detection has seen more consistent success. A multi-task system using YOLOv8 achieved near-perfect mAP for excavator pose estimation (0.995) and respectable scores for detection (0.732) and segmentation (0.615-0.637), though it noted issues with ID inconsistency during occlusions [[4]]. Another study using a lightweight GhostNet detector reported 93.5% mAP for helmet detection, but acknowledged limitations in detecting small or heavily obscured objects [[23]]. This disparity in performance highlights that while CV technology is maturing, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the specific application and the robustness of the underlying model. The table below summarizes performance metrics from several recent studies, illustrating both the successes and the persistent challenges.\n\n| **Study Focus** | **Model Used** | **Dataset(s)** | **Performance Metric(s)** | **Reported Performance** | **Citation** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| PPE Compliance | YOLOv8x | CHV Dataset | mAP@50: 0.929, mAP@50-95: 0.506, Precision: 0.945, Recall: 0.869 | Highest precision/recall among tested YOLOv8 models. | [[11]] |\n| Worker Detection & Fall Risk | ResNet-based Pose Estimation + LSTM | Custom (Real + Synthetic) | Precision: 93%, Recall: 73% (Worker Detection) | Demonstrates the use of synthetic data for rare events. | [[5]] |\n| Excavator Pose Estimation | Integrated Excavator Pose (IEP) Dataset with YOLOv8 | IEP, Open-source | mAP@0.5: 0.995 (Pose Estimation) | Near-perfect performance on a specialized task. | [[4]] |\n| Fall & Helmet Detection | YOLOv8s | Custom (200 images) | Accuracy: 0.62 (Fall Detection), Recall: 0.45 (Fall Detection) | Low recall indicates high miss rate, unsuitable for safety alerting. | [[16]] |\n| Lightweight Helmet Detection | GhostNet | Combined Dataset | mAP: 93.5%, FPS: 42 | Outperforms larger models in terms of efficiency. | [[23]] |\n| Multi-Task Monitoring | YOLOv8 | SODA, MOCS, IEP | mAP@0.5: 0.732 (Detection), 0.615 (Segmentation) | Shows trade-offs in a unified multi-task system. | [[4]] |\n\nThese benchmarks reveal a critical insight: a high mAP score does not automatically translate to a high-quality safety system. Factors such as false negatives (misses), false positives (alarms), and robustness to environmental variability are equally, if not more, important for real-world deployment. The challenge for the research community is to develop more holistic evaluation frameworks that go beyond simple classification accuracy to measure true utility and reliability in complex, dynamic environments."

      "heading": "Applications and Case Studies in Construction Safety",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The application of computer vision in construction safety has expanded rapidly, addressing a wide spectrum of risks and operational needs. The primary focus areas identified in the literature include Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) compliance monitoring, fall detection and prevention, general hazard identification, and the automation of safety-related workflows. These applications are being implemented through a variety of technologies, including fixed-site CCTV cameras, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or drones), and wearable devices, often integrated into broader digital ecosystems like BIM and IoT platforms. The following case studies and applications illustrate the breadth of current deployments and highlight the tangible benefits and challenges of integrating CV into safety management.\n\nOne of the most mature and widely researched applications is PPE compliance monitoring. Systems are routinely developed to automatically detect the absence of hard hats, vests, gloves, and safety goggles. Commercial platforms like viAct are already being deployed on major infrastructure projects in Saudi Arabia, such as NEOM and The Line, to detect missing PPE, unauthorized access to restricted zones, and unsafe machine operations, triggering real-time alerts to managers [[10]]. Academic research has produced similarly sophisticated systems. For example, a study by Alibek Barlybayev and Nurzada Amangeldy utilized two different YOLOv8 models to detect helmets and vests from the SHEL5K and CHV datasets, achieving high precision and recall [[11]]. Another study employed a combination of a YOLOv8 model for scaffolding poles and PaddleOCR for sign recognition to create an assistive navigation system for visually impaired individuals, demonstrating the versatility of CV models in creating safe pathways through construction zones [[2,13]]. The use of synthetic data generated in virtual environments has proven crucial for training these models, especially for simulating rare but critical events like worker falls, which are difficult and unsafe to capture in the real world [[5]].\n\nFall detection represents another critical and challenging application. Given that falls are a leading cause of construction fatalities, accounting for nearly 40% of deaths in the U.S. in 2021, automated fall detection is a high-priority goal [[14]]. Researchers have approached this problem from multiple angles. Some systems rely solely on object detection, using a heuristic like a bounding box aspect ratio (width ≥ 2 × height) to infer a fall, but this method has been shown to have extremely low recall and accuracy, with many misclassifications under poor lighting or oblique viewpoints [[16]]. More advanced approaches combine object detection with pose estimation. A system using a ResNet-based pose estimation model fed into an LSTM network analyzes skeletal data to detect anomalous movements indicative of a fall, offering a more robust solution [[5]]. Another innovative application involves UAVs. Researchers have developed remote proximity monitoring systems where drones equipped with CV are used to track workers and provide warnings when they get too close to hazardous areas, effectively acting as a mobile safety watchman [[17]].\n\nBeyond PPE and falls, CV is being applied to a host of other safety-related tasks. Excavator pose estimation, for instance, is crucial for preventing collisions and ensuring safe operation. A multi-task system using YOLOv8 was able to estimate the pose of an excavator with near-perfect accuracy (mAP of 0.995), showcasing the potential for detailed, real-time machinery monitoring [[4]]. Dynamic collision prewarning for tower cranes has also been addressed, with systems designed to monitor the crane's surroundings and issue alerts to prevent collisions with other structures or personnel [[6]]. In a more integrated approach, Saudi Arabia's deployment of AI-powered safety systems connects edge computing, IoT sensors, wearables, and smart helmets to a central platform. This system can recognize unsafe behaviors like workers being near an edge without a harness and feed all this data into a digital twin of the site for iterative safety improvements [[10]]. Finally, CV is being used to support broader safety management functions. Systems have been developed to integrate with BIM and web viewers via middleware like Robot Operating System (ROS), allowing for real-time inspection data to be overlaid onto digital models, as demonstrated in a simulation of UAV-based bolt counting [[18]]. These diverse applications collectively demonstrate that CV is evolving from a simple monitoring tool into a sophisticated, integrated component of a comprehensive safety ecosystem."

      "heading": "Critical Analysis of Challenges and Open Problems",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Despite the significant progress and promising applications, the widespread and reliable deployment of computer vision for construction safety faces a formidable array of technical, practical, and ethical challenges. A critical analysis of the literature reveals that while state-of-the-art models can achieve high accuracy in controlled settings, their performance degrades substantially in the complex, dynamic, and often hostile environment of a real construction site. These open problems span the entire lifecycle of a CV system, from data acquisition and model training to real-time inference and integration into existing workflows. Addressing these issues is paramount for translating laboratory successes into life-saving tools on the ground.\n\nThe most prominent technical challenge is the severe impact of environmental variability. Construction sites are characterized by unpredictable illumination, shadows, glare, adverse weather conditions, motion blur, and extreme viewing angles [[2,17]]. A model trained primarily on images captured under bright, sunny conditions will likely fail when deployed during a rainy, overcast day or at dusk. Motion blur, common in videos from moving cameras or fast-moving machinery, can render objects unrecognizable [[2]]. Similarly, the geometric ambiguity caused by oblique camera viewpoints is a major source of error, particularly for tasks like fall detection where the orientation of a bounding box is critical [[16]]. This environmental fragility necessitates the development of models that are not just accurate but also robust. While some research addresses this by using data augmentation techniques like brightness adjustment and Gaussian noise [[16]], a more fundamental solution lies in developing architectures inherently resilient to such variations.\n\nAnother critical challenge is occlusion and clutter. On a busy jobsite, workers and equipment are frequently partially or fully obscured by structures, materials, or other people [[2,17]]. This makes detection and tracking exceptionally difficult. Tracking algorithms, such as ByteTrack and BoT-SORT, can experience significant ID inconsistency issues when objects are temporarily lost from view, leading to incorrect associations and confusing alerts [[4]]. Even simple detection can fail, as occluded parts of a worker or equipment may cause the model to miss them entirely. This problem is compounded by the sheer density and complexity of the visual scene. Overcoming this requires not only better feature extractors but also more sophisticated multi-object tracking algorithms that can handle temporary losses gracefully and maintain correct identities.\n\nBeyond the technical hurdles, significant practical barriers hinder adoption. Many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) lack the financial resources and technical expertise to deploy and maintain complex CV systems [[16]]. The cost of hardware, software licenses, and ongoing maintenance can be prohibitive. Furthermore, there is often a lack of seamless integration with existing site workflows and management systems [[17]]. A standalone CV application that does not communicate effectively with project managers or update digital records is of limited value. The \"detection–alert–record–traceability\" loop proposed in one study is a step in the right direction, aiming to embed CV functionality into the fabric of safety management [[16]]. However, interoperability with established platforms like BIM remains a key challenge, with OS compatibility and data access issues needing to be resolved [[18]].\n\nFinally, the ethical dimension presents perhaps the most complex set of challenges. Continuous video surveillance of workers raises profound privacy concerns, especially under regulations like GDPR and the proposed EU AI Act [[9,20]]. The collection of biometric data (e.g., facial recognition) adds another layer of sensitivity. There is a real risk of misuse, such as penalizing workers for unavoidable actions or eroding their autonomy, as documented in the case of Amazon's driver monitoring system [[8]]. The fairness and accountability of these systems are also in question, with potential for algorithmic bias to disproportionately affect certain groups of workers [[8]]. The principle of beneficence requires that any technology deployed must demonstrably improve safety, not just enable surveillance. Achieving this requires a careful balancing of interests—a concept central to the proposed intent- and priority-based ethical framework, which suggests that principles like privacy can be relaxed in favor of safety in critical contexts [[8]]. Developing transparent, fair, and accountable systems that gain the trust of workers is essential for long-term acceptance and success."

      "heading": "Future Research Directions and Strategic Imperatives",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "To overcome the significant challenges and unlock the full potential of computer vision for construction safety, the research community must pursue a multi-pronged strategy focused on enhancing robustness, improving data practices, fostering multimodal integration, and embedding ethical considerations into the core of system design. The future of this field lies not in incremental improvements to existing models but in fundamentally rethinking how we train, deploy, and interact with these technologies in the unique context of the construction site.\n\nA primary research imperative is to move beyond the pursuit of higher accuracy metrics and toward building more robust and reliable systems. This requires a concerted effort to address environmental fragility. Future work should focus on developing novel network architectures and training methodologies that are explicitly designed to be invariant to lighting changes, motion blur, and partial occlusion. This could involve exploring self-supervised and unsupervised learning techniques that can learn meaningful representations from unlabeled, real-world data rather than relying solely on manually annotated, curated datasets. Furthermore, research should investigate context-aware models that can reason about the 3D spatial relationships between objects and the environment, rather than treating every input as a 2D image. This would make systems less susceptible to the geometric ambiguities that currently plague fall detection and pose estimation.\n\nSignificant investment is needed to solve the pervasive data problem. The creation of high-quality, large-scale, and diverse public datasets that accurately reflect the harsh realities of construction sites is a top priority [[12]]. Funding bodies and consortia should support collaborative efforts to collect and annotate such data, making it FAIR-aligned (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) to accelerate progress across the field [[12]]. Parallel to this, research into data-efficient learning and synthetic data generation must continue. Game engines like Unity and Unreal offer immense potential for creating photorealistic simulations of hazardous scenarios that are otherwise impossible to capture [[5,20]]. Future research should focus on closing the \"sim-to-real\" gap—the discrepancy between performance in a simulated environment and on a physical site—by developing domain adaptation and fine-tuning techniques that allow models to quickly adapt to new, unseen conditions.\n\nThe next frontier for construction safety CV is undoubtedly multimodal integration. The future is not a single camera, but a sensor fusion approach that combines vision with other modalities like thermal imaging, LiDAR, audio analysis, and IoT sensor data from wearables [[10,20]]. A truly intelligent system will correlate a visual cue of a worker near an edge with vibration data from nearby machinery, air quality readings, and the worker's own biometric data from a smart helmet to generate a truly context-aware risk assessment [[10]]. Integrating CV with BIM and digital twins will be crucial for situational awareness and predictive analytics, allowing safety managers to see real-time activity superimposed on the planned construction schedule and geometry [[10,18]]. This requires overcoming significant technical hurdles in data fusion, interoperability, and real-time processing, but it represents the path to a deeply integrated and proactive safety management system.\n\nFinally, the strategic imperative is to make these advanced technologies accessible and trustworthy. This involves a dual focus on edge-AI deployment and ethical-by-design principles. Developing lightweight models optimized for edge devices will reduce latency, lower infrastructure costs, and alleviate privacy concerns by keeping sensitive data on-site [[20]]. Simultaneously, a new generation of research must focus on explainable AI (XAI) to make model decisions transparent and understandable to human operators [[6]]. This is essential for building trust and ensuring accountability. Moreover, the development of comprehensive ethical frameworks, like the one proposed for CVWS, must be a collaborative effort involving developers, employers, regulators, and, most importantly, the workers themselves [[8]]. These frameworks must be flexible, adapting to the purpose of the surveillance, and must prioritize transparency, fairness, and human oversight [[8,10]]. By pursuing these strategic directions, the field can transition from simply detecting hazards to actively preventing them, ultimately saving lives and reducing the immense human and economic toll of construction accidents.\n\n---"
