## Introduction and Background

Computational Thinking (CT) has emerged as a cornerstone 21st-century skill, integrated into the curricula of compulsory education systems worldwide [[1]]. Its prominence is underscored by its inclusion in national standards across Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia, reflecting a global consensus on its importance for fostering problem-solving, logical reasoning, and digital literacy from an early age [[4,6]]. Despite this widespread adoption, the term "computational thinking" itself remains subject to varied interpretations and definitions, which can differ significantly between countries. For example, educational frameworks may use terminology such as 'ICT capability' in Australia or 'digital competence' in Sweden, complicating international comparisons and standardization efforts [[1]]. This definitional ambiguity highlights the need for a clear, actionable framework that can guide both instruction and assessment in diverse educational settings. Within this context, programming and coding have become central pedagogical tools for teaching CT, although they are not synonymous. While some sources use the terms interchangeably, a more nuanced view distinguishes programming as a comprehensive process encompassing problem understanding, design, implementation (coding), testing, and maintenance, whereas computer science provides the broader theoretical underpinnings [[1]].

The selection of an appropriate programming environment for primary school students is critical to the success of CT initiatives. The ideal platform must present a low entry barrier, be engaging for young learners, and effectively scaffold the development of complex abstract concepts. In this regard, Scratch has established itself as the most widely used visual block programming language, holding a top ranking on the TIOBE index as of January 2018 [[1]]. Developed at the MIT Media Lab, Scratch was explicitly designed to lower the cognitive load associated with traditional text-based programming languages by eliminating syntax errors and allowing users to build programs through intuitive drag-and-drop blocks [[10]]. This design philosophy makes it accessible to children as young as four years old, a demographic for whom other block-based languages like Alice or Greenfoot are often considered too advanced [[1]]. The platform's online community, which boasts over 21 million users, further enriches the learning experience by promoting a culture of sharing, remixing, and collaborative "computational participation," thereby extending learning beyond the classroom [[10]].

This systematic literature review focuses specifically on the use of Scratch for teaching programming and CT within K-9 education. This scope is deliberately chosen to address a significant gap in the existing research landscape. The foundational systematic review on this topic by Lye and Koh (2014) primarily included studies from higher education, leaving a substantial void in the literature concerning the experiences, challenges, and outcomes in primary and early secondary school contexts [[1]]. By narrowing the focus to K-9, this review aims to provide a targeted analysis of how Scratch functions as a pedagogical tool for younger learners. The overarching motivation for this research is to synthesize current knowledge, identify effective practices, and illuminate the persistent challenges that hinder the full potential of integrating CT through Scratch in primary education. The specific objectives of this review are to: (1) map the key conceptual frameworks and definitions of CT used in conjunction with Scratch; (2) analyze the prevailing pedagogical strategies and their reported impact on student learning outcomes; (3) critically examine the methods and instruments used for assessing CT in these environments; (4) identify the systemic and practical challenges faced by educators; and (5) chart future research directions necessary to advance the field.

## Key Concepts and Definitional Frameworks of Computational Thinking

The concept of Computational Thinking (CT) is multifaceted and has been defined in numerous ways, reflecting its interdisciplinary nature and broad applicability. These definitions cluster around two primary perspectives: a code-centric approach focused on programming skills and an interdisciplinary practices (IDP) approach that views CT as a universal problem-solving methodology applicable far beyond computer science [[11]]. Wing's seminal 2006 paper popularized the notion of CT as a fundamental skill for everyone, akin to reading, writing, and arithmetic, framing it as a universal thought process involving problem decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm design [[5,11]]. This perspective aligns closely with the IDP viewpoint, which emphasizes the transferable cognitive skills developed through computational activities. However, a contrasting definition posits CT simply as "the way of reasoning that allows people to tackle a problem on some data with the aim of having a computer solve it," highlighting three core pillars: algorithms, problem-solving, and data [[6]]. This definition critiques many existing frameworks for underemphasizing the centrality of data in modern computing, while also incorporating components such as parallelization, modeling, and simulation [[6]].

Within the body of literature concerning Scratch and primary education, Brennan and Resnick’s framework stands out as a particularly influential and comprehensive model [[1,4,10]]. Their framework is structured around three interconnected dimensions: computational concepts, computational practices, and computational perspectives. The **computational concepts** dimension includes the fundamental building blocks of programming logic, such as sequences, loops, conditionals, events, operators, and variables [[4,6]]. The **computational practices** dimension describes the behaviors and processes of programmers, including incremental and iterative development, debugging, and reusing/remixing code [[4,6]]. Finally, the **computational perspectives** dimension addresses the mindset and social aspects of creating with technology, such as expressing oneself creatively, connecting projects to personal interests, and questioning the role and impact of technology [[1,4]]. This holistic framework is especially well-suited for analyzing learning with block-based languages like Scratch, as it acknowledges the creative and participatory dimensions that are central to the platform's design and user engagement [[1]].

Other prominent frameworks contribute complementary insights. The International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) outlines a CT construct composed of two main strands: (1) Conceptualizing Problems, which involves understanding digital systems, formulating problems, and collecting and representing data; and (2) Operationalizing Solutions, which involves planning and evaluating solutions and developing algorithms and programs [[5]]. Similarly, Shute et al. proposed six facets of CT—decomposition, abstraction, algorithm design, debugging, iteration, and generalization—which builds upon earlier work by Selby & Woollard (2013) and is frequently cited in empirical studies [[4,5]]. Cansu & Cansu (2019) expanded this list to include automation alongside abstraction, problem decomposition, algorithmic thinking, and generalization [[5]]. The table below summarizes these key frameworks and their relevance to Scratch-based learning.

| Framework/Definition | Core Dimensions/Components | Relevance to Scratch-Based Learning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Brennan & Resnick (2012)** [[1,4]] | **Concepts:** Sequences, Loops, Events, etc. <br> **Practices:** Debugging, Iteration, Remixing <br> **Perspectives:** Expressing, Connecting, Questioning | Provides a comprehensive, multi-dimensional lens for assessing holistic CT development in a creative, block-based environment [[1,10]]. |
| **ICILS (2023) Framework** [[5]] | **Strand 1:** Conceptualizing Problems (Understanding Systems, Formulating Problems, Data Collection) <br> **Strand 2:** Operationalizing Solutions (Planning, Developing Algorithms) | Emphasizes the entire problem-solving cycle, from initial formulation to programmatic solution, aligning with project-based learning in Scratch [[5]]. |
| **Shute et al. (2017)** [[4,5]] | Decomposition, Abstraction, Algorithm Design, Debugging, Iteration, Generalization | Offers a highly practical set of facets that map directly to observable student behaviors during programming tasks and debugging in Scratch [[4]]. |
| **Wing (2006)** [[5]] | Problem Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, Algorithm Design | Serves as the foundational, high-level concept that popularized CT, providing the philosophical basis for why these skills are important [[5,11]]. |
| **CSTA (2011) / Barr & Stephenson (2011)** [[1,11]] | Code-Centric Skills: Algorithms, Abstraction, Modularization, Debugging, Loops, Conditionals | Represents a more traditional, CS-focused view of CT, which is often operationalized in classrooms using Scratch as the vehicle for learning these specific programming constructs [[11]]. |

The choice of framework significantly influences instructional design and assessment. An IDP-oriented framework might prioritize open-ended projects where students apply CT to solve real-world problems in other subjects, while a code-centric framework would likely lead to lessons focused on mastering specific Scratch blocks and debugging techniques. The diversity of these frameworks reflects the evolving nature of the field but also presents a challenge for researchers and educators seeking a unified approach. This review adopts Brennan and Resnick’s framework as a starting point because of its comprehensiveness and its explicit grounding in the context of constructionist learning with tools like Scratch, enabling a more nuanced analysis of the teachable and learnable CT skills that emerge when young learners engage in creative programming [[1]].

## Historical Development and Pedagogical Milestones

The integration of programming and computational thinking into primary education did not happen overnight; it is the culmination of decades of educational theory, technological innovation, and policy evolution. The intellectual roots of modern CT instruction can be traced back to Seymour Papert's pioneering work in the 1980s. His book *Mindstorms* introduced the Logo programming language and articulated a powerful constructionist philosophy [[5]]. Papert argued that children could learn complex concepts most effectively not by being told about them, but by actively constructing tangible artifacts—in his case, simple graphics drawn by a "turtle" on the screen. This approach emphasized learning through exploration and discovery, highlighted the social and affective dimensions of learning, and laid the groundwork for the hands-on, project-based pedagogy that characterizes much of contemporary CT education [[5]]. Papert's vision was one of empowering children as creators of technology rather than passive consumers.

The modern CT movement gained significant momentum with Jeannette Wing's 2006 article, "Computational Thinking," which framed CT as a universal analytical skill essential for everyone, not just computer scientists [[5,11]]. Wing argued that CT involves a set of problem-solving skills and techniques derived from computer science that can be used to enhance disciplines across the curriculum. Her articulation of core components like decomposition, pattern recognition, and abstraction resonated strongly with educators and policymakers, leading to its rapid adoption into formal curricula globally [[5]]. Between 2016 and 2021 alone, 18 of the 25 European countries that had already adopted CT revised their curricula to better incorporate it, demonstrating the profound influence of Wing's conceptualization [[4]].

A pivotal technological milestone in making CT accessible to primary schoolers was the introduction of block-based programming languages. Before platforms like Scratch, Logo, Alice, and others, learning to program typically required grappling with the complexities of syntax in text-based languages like BASIC or Pascal, a significant barrier for young learners [[10]]. Block-based languages revolutionized this landscape by allowing users to assemble programs by snapping together graphical blocks, each representing a specific command or function. Because the blocks only fit together if their shapes match, syntax errors were virtually eliminated, allowing students to focus on the underlying logic, algorithms, and problem-solving strategies without the frustration of correcting typos [[10]]. Scratch, first released in 2007, became the dominant platform in this space due to its intuitive interface, vibrant online community, and strong alignment with constructionist principles [[1,10]]. It was explicitly designed based on Brennan and Resnick's CT framework, which guided the development of features like costumes, backdrops, and sound, making it a holistic environment for creative expression [[1]].

This confluence of new educational theories and accessible technology created fertile ground for pedagogical experimentation. Researchers began to explore how these tools could be used to teach CT. Early work focused on whether programming itself could improve cognitive abilities, with mixed results. More recent research has shifted towards identifying specific pedagogical strategies that are effective within these environments. Inquiry-based methods, for instance, are noted as being effective for acquiring conceptual knowledge, though they require careful scaffolding and prior knowledge from the learner [[7]]. Other approaches include game-based learning, where students create games with Scratch to learn specific content, such as the IPAS learning media developed for fifth-grade students in Indonesia [[3]], and project-based learning, where students undertake extended projects that integrate CT with other subjects, as seen in studies linking Scratch programming to mathematical problem-solving [[9]]. These pedagogical milestones—from Papert's constructionism to Wing's advocacy, and from text-based languages to block-based visual programming—have collectively shaped the current landscape of CT education in primary schools, setting the stage for the rich and diverse body of research that now exists on platforms like Scratch.

## Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Pedagogical Strategies

The current state of practice in teaching Computational Thinking (CT) with Scratch in primary education is characterized by a dynamic and evolving array of pedagogical strategies, driven by the goal of balancing structured learning with creative freedom. Research indicates a trend away from purely direct instruction, toward more interactive and inquiry-based methods that leverage the unique capabilities of the Scratch platform. Inquiry-based learning is frequently highlighted as a potent method for helping students grasp conceptual knowledge, particularly when combined with carefully designed scaffolding [[7]]. This approach encourages students to explore, experiment, and discover principles on their own, which can foster deeper understanding. However, its effectiveness is highly dependent on contextual factors, including the learner's prior knowledge and the provision of timely guidance, which may come in the form of direct instruction at critical junctures [[7]]. This suggests that inquiry and direct instruction are not mutually exclusive but complementary strategies that skilled educators should deploy flexibly depending on the learning objective and student needs [[8]].

One of the most promising pedagogical models emerging from the literature is the combination of direct instruction and inquiry. While some meta-analyses have suggested the superiority of direct instruction based on effect size, critics argue that such comparisons are flawed because they fail to account for crucial variables like teacher expertise, student characteristics, and the specific definition of "achievement" [[8]]. A more balanced view, supported by multiple studies, is that a hybrid approach often yields the best results for conceptual knowledge [[7]]. For example, a teacher might begin a lesson with a brief direct instruction session to introduce a new Scratch block or concept, followed by an inquiry phase where students apply this knowledge to a creative project. This blended strategy ensures that students receive the necessary foundational knowledge while also being challenged to think critically and solve problems independently. This aligns with findings from a study on CT interventions, where programming was the most common practice (used in 81% of studies), but troubleshooting and debugging appeared in 46%, suggesting that practice and problem-solving are integral parts of the learning cycle [[11]].

Specific applications of these strategies reveal a growing sophistication in how CT is being taught. Project-based learning has proven particularly effective. A notable quasi-experimental study by Rodríguez-Martínez, González-Calero, and Sáez-López (2019) demonstrated this clearly. They divided sixth-grade students into an experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). After an initial phase of programming instruction in Scratch, the EG used Scratch to solve mathematical word problems, while the CG used traditional pen-and-paper methods [[9]]. The results were compelling: both groups showed significant improvement in CT, but only the EG showed a statistically significant improvement in mathematical performance [[9]]. This suggests that using Scratch as a tool for problem-solving in another domain (mathematics) can enhance learning in that domain, providing a powerful argument for interdisciplinary CT instruction. Similarly, game-based learning has been successfully implemented in various contexts, such as the development of a Scratch-based game for IPAS (Science) learning in Indonesia, which aimed to make the subject more engaging for fifth-grade students [[3]].

Another key aspect of modern pedagogy is the emphasis on creativity and collaboration. Scratch's online community is a central feature that supports this. With over 21 million registered users, it provides a platform for students to share their projects, remix the creations of others, and engage in a global community of "computational participation" [[10]]. This social dimension fosters collaboration, communication, and peer feedback, all of which are identified as valuable pedagogical tools. Studies show that peer feedback and observation are among the valid assessment methods used to evaluate CT, indicating their value extends beyond assessment into the learning process itself [[4]]. Furthermore, the ability to remix projects in the Scratch community allows students to see real-world examples of CT in action, providing inspiration and scaffolding for their own creations. This participatory culture is a defining feature of Scratch that sets it apart from more isolated programming environments and is a critical component of its success in primary education. The overall picture is one of a field moving towards more holistic, project-based, and socially embedded pedagogies that empower students as creators and problem-solvers.

## Applications, Case Studies, and Reported Outcomes

The application of Scratch in primary education has yielded a wealth of empirical evidence documenting its impact on student learning, engagement, and attitudes. A diverse range of case studies and research designs, from quasi-experiments to longitudinal analyses, have been employed to investigate these outcomes. One of the most consistent findings is that Scratch programming has a positive effect on the development of Computational Thinking skills. A two-year case study utilizing a pretest-posttest design found that students showed significant improvement in CT after the intervention (p < .001, r = .68), reinforcing the effectiveness of sustained exposure to the platform [[2,9]]. This growth in CT is not confined to the domain of computer science; several studies highlight its benefits for learning in other academic areas. The aforementioned study by Rodríguez-Martínez et al. (2019) provided strong evidence for this cross-curricular benefit, showing that while both Scratch-using and control groups improved in CT, only the Scratch group showed a significant gain in mathematical problem-solving proficiency [[9]]. This finding positions Scratch not merely as a tool for teaching computer science, but as a versatile cognitive tool that can support STEM education more broadly.

Beyond specific academic gains, Scratch has been shown to positively influence student engagement and motivation. Multiple studies report increased motivation and interest in learning when Scratch is used as a medium. For instance, a study by Luthfiyyah et al. (2023) specifically examined the effect of Scratch-based learning media on the motivation of fourth-grade students and found it to be a motivating factor [[3]]. This aligns with the platform's design, which prioritizes creativity and personal expression. The ability for students to create their own interactive stories, games, and animations taps into their intrinsic motivation and sense of agency. The social dimension of the Scratch community further enhances engagement by providing opportunities for public display and peer interaction, which can be powerful motivators for young learners [[10]]. The platform's low entry barrier, which eliminates syntax errors, also contributes to a less frustrating and more enjoyable learning experience compared to text-based languages, thereby sustaining student interest [[10]].

The table below summarizes key findings from selected case studies and research papers mentioned in the provided context, illustrating the breadth of documented outcomes.

These studies collectively demonstrate that Scratch is not just a theoretical tool but a practical and effective one with measurable impacts. It serves as a bridge to other subjects, boosts student motivation, and helps develop essential 21st-century skills like creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration [[10]]. The variety of applications—from enhancing mathematics and science learning to being used in extracurricular clubs—illustrates its versatility. However, it is crucial to note that while these outcomes are largely positive, the effectiveness of these interventions is highly dependent on the quality of instruction and the pedagogical context. The success stories are often those where Scratch is used as part of a well-designed, inquiry-based, and supportive learning environment, rather than as a standalone software package.

## Assessment, Challenges, and Open Problems

Despite the documented successes of Scratch in primary education, the field faces significant challenges related to assessment, teacher preparedness, and systemic integration. These issues represent critical open problems that must be addressed to ensure the continued growth and effectiveness of CT instruction. A primary challenge lies in the assessment of Computational Thinking itself. Teachers and researchers struggle to find valid and reliable methods to measure the complex, multidimensional nature of CT [[4]]. A study conducted in Norway and Finland found that while teachers perceive assessing core CT knowledge—such as debugging and the functionality of code—as relatively straightforward, assessing applied CT knowledge like problem decomposition, creativity, and collaboration is much more difficult [[4]]. This difficulty stems from a lack of clear criteria and the subjective nature of evaluating creative and transferable skills. Consequently, assessments often default to measuring final products or specific programming skills, potentially overlooking the development of deeper CT competencies.

To navigate this challenge, researchers and practitioners have explored a variety of assessment methods. Validated instruments include rubrics, portfolio assessments, analysis of student code, peer feedback, and direct observation [[4]]. For example, the Visual Blocks Creative Computing Test (VBCCT) was used in one study to assess computational concepts and practices, while another study utilized a validated test for CT concepts and a separate Mathematical Knowledge Test [[2,9]]. While these methods provide valuable data points, they often require significant time and expertise to implement effectively, posing a major hurdle for busy classroom teachers [[4]]. The misalignment between curriculum goals and high-stakes national exams further exacerbates the problem, as teachers may feel pressured to focus on easily testable content at the expense of more complex, applied CT skills [[4]].

Compounding the assessment challenge is the issue of teacher training and preparedness. Many teachers report low perceived readiness to teach CT, citing insufficient pedagogical knowledge and a lack of support [[4,6]]. Professional development programs are often criticized for focusing too heavily on technical skills (how to use Scratch) and not enough on pedagogy (how to teach with Scratch) [[6]]. This is evidenced by studies exploring the perceptions of preservice teachers, who also express uncertainty about their ability to teach coding and CT effectively [[3]]. Without adequate training, even the most well-designed curriculum and platform can fail. International initiatives like the VELA project in the U.S., which provided professional development for teachers on topics like variables and abstraction, are steps in the right direction but highlight the systemic need for sustained, high-quality support [[10]].

Finally, systemic and contextual factors present significant barriers to widespread and equitable implementation. The very definition of CT varies between countries, leading to inconsistent curricula and standards [[1,6]]. This creates challenges for international collaboration and for developing universally applicable teaching resources. Furthermore, there is a risk of publication bias and limited database scope in the existing literature, which may not fully represent the global landscape of practice [[10]]. The following table summarizes the key challenges and open problems identified in the literature.

| Challenge Category | Specific Issues | Supporting Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Assessment** | Difficulty assessing applied CT (creativity, collaboration); reliance on final products; lack of clear criteria; time-consuming methods. | [[4]] |
| | Misalignment between curriculum goals and summative exams, leading to a focus on testable skills over deep understanding. | [[4]] |
| **Teacher Preparedness** | Low perceived readiness among teachers; insufficient pedagogical focus in professional development; need for sustained support. | [[3,4,6]] |
| **Systemic Factors** | Vague or inconsistent curricular guidelines across regions/countries; varying definitions of CT impacting implementation. | [[1,4,6]] |
| | Potential for publication bias and limited scope of databases in existing reviews. | [[10]] |

Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach. For assessment, there is a need for the development and validation of more robust, authentic, and efficient assessment tools that capture the full spectrum of CT. For teachers, this means investing in high-quality, long-term professional development that balances technical skill-building with pedagogical strategies grounded in evidence-based practices. Systemically, clearer, more consistent national and international standards for CT are needed, along with greater investment in research that captures a more diverse and representative global picture of practice.

## Future Research Directions

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the current literature and the identification of key challenges, several distinct and critical avenues for future research emerge. These directions aim to deepen our understanding of how Scratch can be leveraged to its fullest potential in primary education and to overcome the persistent obstacles that currently limit its impact. The most pressing area for future investigation is the development and validation of more sophisticated and holistic assessment methodologies for Computational Thinking. Current assessment practices often fall short of capturing the full complexity of what students learn, particularly the creative, collaborative, and applied aspects of CT [[4]]. Future research should move beyond simple rubrics and code analysis to explore the use of learning analytics, automated feedback systems, and portfolio-based assessments that can track student progress over time. Such research should also focus on creating tools that are both valid and efficient enough for routine classroom use, thereby bridging the gap between research and practice. Additionally, comparative studies are needed to evaluate the relative effectiveness of different assessment methods, providing educators with evidence-based guidance on selecting the most appropriate tools for their specific goals.

A second critical research frontier is the investigation of pedagogical strategies that maximize the interdisciplinary potential of Scratch. While existing studies provide evidence for its benefits in mathematics and science, more research is needed to systematically explore its application across the entire K-9 curriculum. Future studies should employ rigorous quasi-experimental and experimental designs to compare the effectiveness of using Scratch for discipline-specific problem-solving versus using it as a general-purpose creative tool. For example, does using Scratch to create historical simulations improve social studies learning? Does programming musical compositions with Scratch enhance music education? Answering these questions will help build a stronger case for the cross-curricular integration of CT and provide teachers with a wider repertoire of effective strategies. Furthermore, research should delve deeper into the optimal balance between direct instruction and inquiry-based learning, perhaps using design-based research methodologies to iteratively develop and refine hybrid pedagogical models that are tailored to specific learning objectives and student populations.

Thirdly, there is an urgent need for research focused on teacher education and professional development. Future studies should move beyond documenting teachers' self-perceived needs and instead focus on designing, implementing, and rigorously evaluating professional development programs. These programs should be co-designed with practicing teachers and should emphasize not just technical skills but also pedagogical content knowledge for CT. Longitudinal studies tracking teachers' growth from novice to expert in teaching with Scratch would be invaluable. Research should also explore innovative delivery models for professional development, such as peer-led communities of practice, online micro-credentialing pathways, and partnerships with universities and industry, to determine which models are most effective at scale and in diverse contexts. Understanding how to create sustainable support ecosystems for teachers is paramount to the long-term success of any CT initiative.

Finally, future research must broaden its scope to address systemic issues and promote equity in access to CT education. This includes conducting more studies in non-Western contexts to understand how cultural factors influence the implementation and reception of CT. Comparative international studies are needed to analyze the impact of different curricular structures and policies on student outcomes [[1,6]]. Another vital area is research into the accessibility of Scratch and similar platforms for students with disabilities. How can Scratch be adapted to be more inclusive for visually or motor-impaired learners? How can we ensure that the benefits of CT education are available to all students, regardless of socioeconomic status or geographic location? Addressing these equity-focused questions is essential for ensuring that the promise of computational thinking is realized for every child. By pursuing these research directions, the field can build a more robust evidence base, develop more effective and equitable practices, and ultimately fulfill the transformative potential of teaching Computational Thinking with platforms like Scratch in primary education.
