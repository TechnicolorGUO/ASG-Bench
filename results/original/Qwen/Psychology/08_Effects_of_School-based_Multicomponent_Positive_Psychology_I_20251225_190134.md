This research aims to evaluate the impact of multicomponent positive psychology interventions implemented in school settings on adolescent well-being and psychological distress. The review will synthesize evidence from existing studies, assess methodological quality, identify effective components, explore contextual applications, and highlight gaps in current knowledge regarding intervention design, outcomes, and scalability within educational environments.# A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of School-Based Multicomponent Positive Psychology Interventions for Adolescent Well-being and Distress

## Introduction and Research Objectives

The global mental health landscape for adolescents is increasingly concerning, marked by rising rates of psychological distress and a persistent gap between need and access to care. In response, schools have emerged as a critical setting for the implementation of preventive interventions aimed at fostering well-being and mitigating distress. Within this context, school-based multicomponent positive psychology interventions (PPIs) have gained significant traction. Grounded in the scientific study of positive human functioning, these interventions seek to cultivate strengths, virtues, and positive emotions that can buffer against mental illness and promote flourishing. The rationale for targeting adolescents is compelling; this period is characterized by significant neurodevelopmental changes, increased academic and social pressures, and the formation of enduring patterns of thought and behavior. Consequently, intervening during adolescence presents a crucial opportunity to build resilience and establish pathways toward lifelong mental wellness.

Despite the proliferation of such programs, a systematic and rigorous evaluation of their collective impact on both well-being and distress is essential. While numerous studies report promising outcomes, there remains considerable heterogeneity in program design, theoretical underpinnings, and methodological quality. This review aims to address this gap by synthesizing current evidence through a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. It seeks to provide a comprehensive answer to the central research question: What are the effects of school-based multicomponent positive psychology interventions on adolescent well-being and distress? By focusing specifically on multicomponent interventions, which integrate various techniques rather than relying on a single approach, this review acknowledges the complex nature of adolescent development and mental health.

The primary objectives of this review are threefold. First, it seeks to quantify the overall effect sizes of these interventions on key outcomes, including subjective well-being, psychological well-being, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and stress. Second, it aims to analyze the specific components, frameworks, and delivery mechanisms that characterize effective PPIs. Third, it will critically evaluate the existing body of research to identify its strengths, weaknesses, and major limitations, thereby charting a course for future inquiry. This analysis is not merely an academic exercise but has profound implications for educators, policymakers, and clinicians who are tasked with allocating resources and designing programs that can make a tangible difference in the lives of young people. By clarifying what works, for whom, and under what conditions, this review contributes to the growing movement to embed evidence-based practices for positive youth development within educational systems worldwide.

## Key Concepts, Frameworks, and Methodologies

The field of positive psychology provides the foundational principles for the interventions under review, though its application within school settings is often integrated with other established frameworks. Central to positive psychology is the PERMA model developed by Martin Seligman, which posits five pillars of well-being: Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment [[25,26]]. Many school-based programs are explicitly designed to target these domains, for example, through gratitude exercises to foster positive emotion, mindfulness activities to enhance engagement, and community service projects to build meaning [[25]]. However, the practical implementation of these interventions frequently draws from a broader ecosystem of theories. Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) is a prominent parallel framework, emphasizing competencies such as self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making [[7]]. Indeed, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2019) identifies SEL and Positive Youth Development (PYD) as core components of effective adolescent health programs [[7]]. Another influential framework is the SEARCH model, which outlines six pathways to adolescent well-being: strengths, emotional management, attention and awareness, relationships, coping, and habits and goals [[20]].

A more recent conceptual advance is the Extended-Evolutionary Meta-Model (EEMM), which moves beyond fixed intervention packages toward a process-based approach [[23,26]]. The EEMM organizes positive psychology constructs across six psychological dimensions—such as affect, cognition, and motivation—and integrates them with theories like Self-Determination Theory and broaden-and-build theory [[23,26]]. This model advocates for tailoring interventions based on idiographic data, targeting specific processes of change like cognitive reappraisal or savoring to suit individual needs and contexts [[23]]. This represents a significant shift from a one-size-fits-all philosophy to a more personalized and adaptive strategy. Other models mentioned include Fordyce's happiness program and the Protective Possibilities Framework, which grounds interventions in ecological systems theory [[9,26]].

In terms of methodologies, the implementation of these interventions varies widely. Delivery agents range from trained school staff and external facilitators to researchers and digital platforms [[21,24]]. The duration and format also differ, with group sessions being the most common mode of delivery, typically held weekly for 60-minute sessions over a period of around 10 weeks [[24]]. However, there is a growing trend toward digital delivery, with web-based and smartphone applications becoming increasingly prevalent [[22]]. For instance, the Thrive program was delivered via Zoom, while others utilize dedicated apps for homework assignments like gratitude journaling [[19]]. Cultural adaptation is another critical methodology, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where interventions are modified to incorporate local languages, spiritual values, and delivery methods to ensure relevance and engagement [[24]]. The table below summarizes several prominent school-based PPI frameworks.

| Framework Name | Developer(s)/Origin | Core Components | Target Outcomes | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PERMA** | Martin Seligman | Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment | Subjective & Psychological Well-being | `[[25,26]]` |
| **SEARCH** | Waters & Loton | Strengths, Emotional Management, Attention & Awareness, Relationships, Coping, Habits & Goals | Well-being, Distress, Academic Outcomes | `[[20]]` |
| **Maytiv Program** | Israel | Gratitude, Compassion, Flow, Mindfulness, Hope, Perseverance, Character Strengths | Distress, Self-Esteem, Optimism, School Engagement | `[[25]]` |
| **Get to Know Me+** | Catalonia, Spain | Present Positive Emotions, Past Gratitude, Future Optimism & Goal Setting | Time Attitude, Well-being, Distress | `[[6,27]]` |
| **Thrive Program** | U.S. | Positive Psychology, CBT, Mindfulness, Gratitude, Character Strengths | Depression, Anxiety, Quality of Life | `[[19]]` |
| **EEMM** | Not specified | Process-based approach integrating PERMA, SDT, etc. | Personalized improvement in well-being and reduction of distress | `[[23,26]]` |

This diversity in conceptualization and implementation highlights the dynamic and evolving nature of the field. While a clear theoretical foundation is a hallmark of effective programs, the successful translation of these theories into practice requires careful consideration of the delivery context, the capabilities of the facilitators, and the cultural milieu of the adolescent participants.

## Effects on Adolescent Well-being and Distress: A Meta-analytic Synthesis

A quantitative synthesis of the available evidence reveals that school-based multicomponent positive psychology interventions have a demonstrable, albeit modest, positive impact on adolescent mental health. A seminal meta-analysis by Tejada-Gallardo et al. (2020), which included nine studies with a total of nearly 4,900 participants, found small but statistically significant effects for multiple outcomes. Specifically, the interventions were associated with improvements in subjective well-being (Effect size g = 0.24), psychological well-being (g = 0.25), and reductions in depression symptoms (g = 0.28) [[5]]. These findings suggest that when implemented effectively, PPIs can contribute meaningfully to the promotion of well-being and the prevention of depressive difficulties in adolescents.

However, the magnitude of these effects can be influenced by the quality of the underlying studies. When the meta-analysis by Tejada-Gallardo et al. excluded lower-quality studies, the effect size for subjective well-being decreased slightly, but the effect sizes for psychological well-being and depression symptoms actually increased [[5]]. This counterintuitive finding suggests that some poorly designed studies may have overestimated the benefits, while the core intervention components remain robustly effective. Further evidence comes from a 2025 meta-analysis by Lekamge et al., which evaluated whole-school interventions based on the World Health Organization’s Health-Promoting Schools Framework. While this framework is broader than a purely positive psychology approach, it includes many overlapping components. This analysis found significant reductions in negative behaviors such as cyber-bullying (OR 0.75) and regular smoking (OR 0.69) [[3]]. Critically for this review, however, no significant effects were detected for anxiety, depression, alcohol use, or positive mental health, highlighting the potential limitations of broad, less-targeted approaches [[3]].

The impact of these interventions extends to digital formats, with a meta-analysis of 35 controlled trials showing that digital PPIs are effective, particularly when compared to waitlist controls [[22]]. These interventions demonstrated large effect sizes for improving well-being constructs like hope (Hedges' g = 0.555) and compassion (g = 0.447), and moderate to large effects for reducing ill-being factors like cognitive biases (g = –0.637) and stress levels (g = –0.342) [[22]]. The effectiveness of digital interventions underscores the potential for scalability and reach, especially in contexts where traditional face-to-face delivery is challenging. Similarly, a systematic review focusing on school-based mental health literacy (MHL) interventions found a moderate to large significant effect on MHL improvement (g = 0.595), with even larger effects on knowledge outcomes (g = 0.893) [[12]]. This indicates that interventions do not just improve well-being but also empower adolescents with the knowledge to understand and seek help for their own mental health.

The timing of the intervention's effect is also a critical variable. Several studies report sustained benefits up to eight months post-intervention, particularly for techniques related to gratitude, character strengths, and growth mindset [[24]]. For example, the long-term Maytiv Program in Israel showed improvements in well-being and school engagement measured over 21 months [[25]]. In contrast, indicated school-based psychological interventions for adolescents with elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety show strong immediate effects that tend to dissipate over time. One meta-analysis found that while these interventions produced a medium effect on anxiety and a small effect on depression immediately post-intervention, these benefits were not maintained at follow-up periods longer than six months [[13]]. This suggests that for students already experiencing clinical-level distress, ongoing booster sessions or a different intensity of support may be necessary to sustain gains. Furthermore, network analysis from the 'Get to Know Me+' study revealed that the intervention induced temporary reconfigurations in the interplay between well-being and distress, a pattern that disappeared at follow-up, indicating short-term structural changes in mental health networks [[27]]. This points to a need for more longitudinal research to understand the durability of these effects.

## Applications, Case Studies, and Implementation Factors

The practical application of positive psychology in schools takes diverse forms, from comprehensive, multi-year curricula to brief, stand-alone classroom exercises. These programs are implemented across a wide range of geographical locations and educational contexts, reflecting their global appeal. A scoping review identified multi-component interventions in 12 LMICs, with a majority in upper-middle-income countries like China and Brazil [[24]]. In high-income countries, notable programs include the Maytiv Program in Israel, which has served over 50,000 children, and the 'Get to Know Me+' program in Spain [[6,25]]. Digital platforms have also enabled widespread dissemination, with programs like SPARX originating in New Zealand and programs like Thrive adapting to remote delivery via Zoom [[19,21]].

Several case studies provide detailed insights into the structure and outcomes of specific interventions. The **Maytiv Program**, implemented in Israeli middle schools, consists of 15, 90-minute sessions delivered bi-weekly by trained teachers [[25]]. Its curriculum is rich with content targeting gratitude, compassion, mindfulness, and character strengths, using a five-step teaching method involving stories, exercises, and writing [[25]]. Longitudinal data from this program show sustained improvements in subjective well-being, peer relations, and even academic outcomes like attendance and GPA over a period of 21 months [[25]].

The **'Get to Know Me+'** program, delivered in Spanish high schools, focused on shifting adolescents' "time attitudes" by encouraging reflection on past positive experiences (gratitude), present positive emotions (character strengths), and future aspirations (optimism) [[6]]. Using latent profile analysis, the study identified distinct profiles of time attitude among students, and found that the intervention significantly increased the likelihood of transitioning from a negative or present/future negative profile to a more optimistic one [[6]]. This demonstrates a nuanced application of positive psychology that targets not just general well-being but specific cognitive-affective structures.

More recently, digital and hybrid models have become prominent. The **Thrive program** is a 6-week online intervention that successfully integrated positive psychology, CBT, and mindfulness for U.S. adolescents [[19]]. Delivered via Zoom by paraprofessional facilitators, it achieved high completion rates (75%) and significant improvements in depression, anxiety, and quality of life [[19]]. The inclusion of weekly homework via a dedicated app reinforced the skills learned in session [[19]]. Similarly, the **Coming Up for AIR** program uses a 60-minute PowerPoint and video presentation format, enhanced with interactive discussion and the presence of therapy dogs, to deliver mental health education to middle and high school students, resulting in significant gains in mental health literacy [[14]].

Implementation factors play a crucial role in determining success. The SAFE framework—Sequenced, Active, Focused, Explicit—is consistently cited as a set of characteristics for effective programs [[7]]. Furthermore, the identity of the facilitator appears to be a key determinant of outcome. A meta-analysis by Zink et al. found that interventions delivered by mental health professionals had a significant effect on reducing depression symptoms at 12-month follow-up, whereas interventions delivered by internal school staff did not [[13,21]]. This suggests a critical trade-off between accessibility and expert-led delivery. While involving school staff is essential for sustainability, it may compromise efficacy unless they receive intensive, professional-level training. Indeed, one study highlighted that targeted, professionally led training in positive education was significantly associated with greater implementation of well-being practices among educators [[16]]. Finally, cultural adaptation is vital for global applicability. Successful interventions in LMICs often involve adapting delivery methods, language, and content to integrate local spirituality and traditions, which enhances engagement and relevance [[24]]. High participant retention rates (>90% in 75% of reviewed studies) further indicate that adolescents are generally engaged and willing to participate in these programs [[24]].

## Critical Analysis of the Field's Strengths and Weaknesses

The field of school-based positive psychology interventions has made significant strides, yet a critical appraisal reveals a complex picture of both notable strengths and serious methodological weaknesses. The primary strength lies in the consistent demonstration of a small but statistically significant positive effect on adolescent well-being and distress. Multiple meta-analyses confirm that these interventions work, particularly in enhancing well-being and reducing depression symptoms [[5,22]]. The breadth of the field is another strength, with a vast array of theoretical frameworks, program designs, and delivery modes being explored globally [[20,24,25]]. This diversity allows for flexibility in implementation and adaptation to different school cultures and student needs. Furthermore, the increasing focus on digital interventions offers a promising pathway toward scaling up these beneficial practices to reach larger numbers of adolescents efficiently and cost-effectively [[22]].

Another significant strength is the growing emphasis on identifying active ingredients. Researchers are moving beyond simply evaluating entire programs to dissecting them into component parts to understand which elements are most effective. The identification of 64 brief, evidence-based PPIs categorized by the ACTIONS framework is a prime example of this trend [[28]]. This granular approach allows for more strategic program design, enabling educators and psychologists to select specific, potent exercises rather than implementing a rigid, pre-packaged curriculum. The development of sophisticated models like the EEMM also signals a move towards a more nuanced, personalized understanding of how positive psychology works [[23,26]].

However, the field is severely constrained by significant weaknesses, primarily centered on the poor methodological quality of much of the existing research. A pervasive issue is the high risk of bias. A systematic review of universal mental health interventions in primary schools found that only one of 39 included studies was at low risk of bias, while the majority were at high risk, largely due to issues like lack of blinding and reliance on self-report measures [[1]]. This problem is echoed in reviews of SBIs for resilience and indicated interventions for adolescents, where the vast majority of studies were rated as having a high risk of bias according to the RoB 2 assessment tool [[9,21]]. This undermines confidence in the reported effect sizes, as they may be inflated by methodological artifacts. The certainty of evidence for many outcomes is rated as very low, indicating that true effects could be substantially different from those reported [[9]].

A second major weakness is the challenge of sustaining effects over time. As noted, indicated interventions often fail to maintain their benefits at long-term follow-up, and network-level changes observed in some studies vanish after the intervention ends [[13,27]]. This raises questions about whether the interventions produce lasting change or simply temporary boosts in mood. Without long-term follow-up data, it is difficult to assess the true public health impact of these programs. High heterogeneity across studies is another significant problem, making it difficult to conduct meaningful meta-analyses and synthesize results. This variability stems from differences in intervention design, theoretical basis, duration, delivery agent, and measurement tools [[9,21]]. The lack of standardized outcome measures exacerbates this issue; while instruments like the SDQ and MHC-SF are used, there is no consensus, leading to fragmented and sometimes conflicting evidence [[1,4]]. Finally, the field is still grappling with the challenge of equity. While interventions are being rolled out globally, ensuring they are culturally sensitive, accessible, and effective for diverse populations—including those from different socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnicities, and geographic regions—remains a critical and unresolved task [[11,24]].

## Identification of Research Gaps and Future Directions

While the field of school-based positive psychology has established a proof of concept, significant gaps in the evidence base point to clear directions for future research. The most pressing need is to improve the methodological rigor of studies. Future investigations must prioritize randomized controlled trials with adequate allocation concealment, blinding of assessors, and long-term follow-up periods (at least 12 months) to accurately measure the durability of effects [[21]]. Reducing the high risk of bias inherent in many current studies is non-negotiable if we are to build a credible body of evidence. Additionally, there is a critical need for more research conducted in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 90% of the world's youth reside but where the evidence base is currently weak [[10,11]]. Much of the existing research is concentrated in Western, high-income nations, raising questions about the generalizability of findings to other cultural contexts [[17,25]].

A second major research gap concerns the optimization of intervention design. The field is ripe for comparative effectiveness research that pits different theoretical frameworks against each other (e.g., PERMA vs. SEARCH) and compares different delivery modes (digital vs. in-person). More importantly, future work should systematically test the active ingredients of interventions. Rather than treating programs as monolithic entities, researchers should employ experimental designs to isolate and compare the effects of specific components, such as gratitude exercises versus mindfulness practices, to determine which elements are most potent for which outcomes [[28]]. The development of a core set of recommended outcome measures would also be invaluable for facilitating cross-study comparisons and meta-analyses [[4]]. Future research should also explore the optimal dosage and frequency of interventions. While 10- to 15-session programs are common, it is unclear whether longer, more intensive programs yield better or more durable results.

The third area for future exploration is implementation science. We need to understand the precise mechanisms through which positive psychology translates into practice. This includes investigating the ideal level of training and support required for school staff to implement programs effectively without the need for external experts, balancing accessibility with fidelity and efficacy [[16,21]]. Research should also examine the role of school climate and leadership in supporting or hindering the successful integration of these programs into the school day. Moreover, there is a need to move beyond simply assessing outcomes to understanding the *processes* of change. Adopting a process-based approach, as advocated by the EEMM, means tracking not just end-of-program scores but also the intermediate steps, such as shifts in cognitive styles or increases in specific behaviors, that lead to improved well-being [[23,26]].

Finally, a crucial future direction is the explicit examination of potential harms and inequities. While most studies report positive outcomes, emerging evidence from large-scale trials like MYRIAD and AWARE has flagged potential risks, including increased emotional difficulties for some participants in certain programs [[28]]. Future research must proactively monitor for adverse events and explore why some individuals might be harmed. This includes investigating differential effects based on baseline risk factors, gender, and ethnicity. Furthermore, research should continue to focus on developing and testing culturally adapted interventions that are truly responsive to the needs of diverse communities, ensuring that the benefits of positive psychology are distributed equitably.

## Conclusion

In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysis finds that school-based multicomponent positive psychology interventions possess a modest but significant capacity to enhance well-being and reduce depression symptoms among adolescents. The evidence base is strengthened by multiple independent meta-analyses and a wide array of applied programs demonstrating positive effects. However, the field is simultaneously hampered by severe methodological weaknesses, including a high prevalence of bias, poor reporting standards, and a lack of long-term follow-up data. The most effective programs are often theory-driven, sequenced, and delivered by trained facilitators, yet their effects can be fragile and may not persist over time. The future of this field depends on addressing these critical gaps through higher-quality research, a deeper investigation into program components and implementation strategies, and a more nuanced understanding of both the potential benefits and the possible risks. Ultimately, translating the promise of positive psychology into a reliable public health strategy for youth requires a concerted effort to build a more rigorous, equitable, and sustainable evidence base.
