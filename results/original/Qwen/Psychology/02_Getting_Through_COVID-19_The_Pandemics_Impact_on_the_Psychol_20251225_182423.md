## Introduction: The Confluence of Crises

The COVID-19 pandemic emerged not as an isolated event but as a systemic shock that reverberated through every facet of human society, fundamentally altering the trajectory of global progress. Its impact transcended public health, creating a confluence of interconnected crises that challenged prevailing paradigms in sustainability, quality of life, and economic stability [[5]]. Framed by the influential concept of the "anthropause"—a period of reduced human mobility and activity—the pandemic provided an unprecedented natural experiment, revealing deep-seated vulnerabilities while simultaneously offering glimpses of potential pathways toward transformation [[5]]. This review synthesizes existing literature to systematically analyze the multifaceted impacts of the pandemic across these three critical domains. By examining the psychological shifts in pro-sustainability behaviors, the profound degradation of quality of life for vulnerable populations, and the staggering disruption of the global economy, this paper seeks to illuminate the complex legacy of the pandemic. The analysis reveals a world profoundly altered, where the pre-pandemic normal has been irrevocably changed, leaving behind significant challenges and opening new avenues for research and policy innovation. Understanding these intertwined consequences is paramount for navigating the post-pandemic era and building a more resilient and sustainable future.

The primary motivation for this review stems from the need to synthesize fragmented findings into a coherent understanding of the pandemic's holistic impact. While extensive research has been conducted within each domain—public health, environmental science, economics, and psychology—few studies have undertaken a comprehensive synthesis that connects these disparate threads. This gap represents a significant weakness in the collective knowledge base, hindering the development of integrated policies that could address the root causes of societal vulnerability. For instance, economic recovery strategies that ignore their impact on mental health or environmental sustainability are likely to be short-lived and inequitable. This review aims to bridge these silos by systematically mapping the interdependencies between changes in psychological well-being, shifts in sustainable practices, and economic outcomes. Furthermore, it addresses the limitations of much pandemic-related research, such as its heavy reliance on quantitative methods and self-reports, which can overlook nuanced lived experiences and contextual factors [[13,22]]. By incorporating insights from qualitative studies and focusing on the perspectives of marginalized groups, this review provides a more balanced and inclusive account of the pandemic's effects [[3]].

The objectives of this systematic review are threefold. First, it aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the key concepts and definitions related to the psychology of sustainability, quality of life, and the global economy, establishing a common language for interdisciplinary discourse. Second, it will critically analyze the evidence regarding the specific impacts of the pandemic on these domains, identifying both negative consequences and unexpected positive side effects. Third, and most importantly, it will move beyond description to offer a critical analysis of the field's strengths and weaknesses, identify crucial research gaps, and propose future directions for research and policy. This includes highlighting the tensions between research output, capacity building, and societal impact, particularly in the context of international collaborations [[10]]. Ultimately, this review aspires to serve as a foundational resource for academics, policymakers, and practitioners seeking to understand the enduring legacies of the COVID-19 pandemic and to leverage its lessons for fostering a more just, healthy, and sustainable world.

## The Psychology of Sustainability in the Time of Crisis

The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a powerful catalyst for re-examining the intricate relationship between human psychology and environmental sustainability. The enforced reduction in human activity, termed the "anthropause," created a unique laboratory for observing how sudden, large-scale behavioral changes affect both individual mindsets and collective action towards sustainability [[5]]. Research in this area has moved beyond traditional frameworks, exploring novel psychological constructs and integrating insights from positive psychology to understand what truly fosters sustainable behavior. The emerging field of the "Psychology of Sustainability" itself has evolved, shifting from prevention-focused models centered on risk avoidance to promotion-oriented approaches that emphasize enrichment, growth, and flourishing across personal, social, and ecological environments [[2]]. This shift suggests that sustainable action may be more powerfully motivated by aspirations for a better life than by fear of a worse one.

A central theme in this research is the exploration of new psychological drivers for pro-environmental behavior (PEB). One study involving university students found that belief in a connection between COVID-19 and climate change was widespread, with a majority agreeing that lockdowns had demonstrated that habit changes could improve climate conditions [[21]]. However, this awareness did not automatically translate into prioritization; a significant portion of respondents still viewed climate change as less urgent than the immediate threat of the pandemic [[21]]. This highlights a critical challenge: while crises can create teachable moments, they do not guarantee a lasting shift in values or priorities. Another innovative line of inquiry focuses on the role of coping mechanisms. Research with Finnish adolescents revealed a complex dynamic where increased climate distress was associated with higher PEB over time, but only when mediated by meaning-focused coping strategies [[23]]. This suggests that psychological resilience and the ability to find purpose in difficult situations are crucial for translating concern into sustained action. Furthermore, studies show that intrinsic motivations, such as perceived competence and relatedness, are strong predictors of sustainability-oriented entrepreneurial intentions [[25]], while external factors like social norms can effectively moderate the intention-behavior gap, particularly for individuals with low initial motivation [[20]].

Despite these promising developments, the field faces significant theoretical and methodological challenges. There is no dominant framework for categorizing pro-environmental behaviors, and researchers often balance ease of measurement against the perceived conservation impact, potentially skewing the focus of studies [[22]]. Methodologically, the field is characterized by a sampling bias toward the Global North and a reliance on quantitative designs and self-report measures, which can obscure the rich, contextualized realities of sustainability practices in diverse settings [[22]]. The very definition of sustainability is also evolving. Traditional models focused on the "three Es" (economy, equity, ecology) are giving way to more integrated approaches. For example, workplace social sustainability now incorporates dimensions of decent work, gender equality, and organizational culture under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [[4]]. Decent work is defined as a balance between personal fulfillment and human protection, encompassing fair wages, safe conditions, and social protection [[4]]. In a striking finding, one study concluded that societal happiness variance was explained 94% by sustainability indicators, with environmental and social dimensions showing a positive link to happiness, contrary to economic factors [[4]]. This points towards a paradigm where economic success is seen as a means to an end, rather than the end itself. The integration of qualitative methods, such as photovoice and ethnography, is increasingly recognized as essential for uncovering lived experiences and community-level responses that quantitative data alone cannot capture [[3]].

## The Shifting Landscape of Quality of Life and Well-being

The COVID-19 pandemic inflicted a severe and lasting blow to the quality of life and psychological well-being of populations worldwide, exposing deep fractures in social safety nets and exacerbating pre-existing inequalities. The crisis manifested in a dual burden: a direct health emergency compounded by a parallel mental health crisis, fueled by fear, isolation, economic precarity, and loss. Longitudinal studies reveal that while many individuals demonstrated remarkable resilience, a significant portion experienced persistent psychological distress. A Swiss study following adults over two years identified three distinct trajectories: a group with consistently good well-being (73%), a group whose well-being steadily declined (21%), and a small but highly vulnerable group with consistently low well-being (5%) [[7]]. Factors strongly associated with poor outcomes included younger age, lack of social support, caregiving responsibilities, and heightened stress from disrupted routines [[7]]. Similarly, a Swedish study documented significant psychological distress that peaked during the first wave and remained elevated throughout the subsequent waves, with women and young adults reporting the highest levels of distress and life dissatisfaction [[17]]. These findings underscore that the pandemic's psychological toll was not uniform, hitting the most vulnerable the hardest.

The pandemic also laid bare and intensified structural inequalities, disproportionately affecting women, youth, and marginalized communities. Women bore a heavier burden due to their overrepresentation in sectors hit hardest by lockdowns, such as accommodation and food services, and because they shoulder a greater share of unpaid care work as schools and childcare facilities closed [[12,24]]. Young adults, facing job insecurity and disrupted education, reported higher rates of anxiety and depression [[11,17]]. The impact was even more acute for those already facing marginalization; studies highlighted the disproportionate suffering of Black, Indigenous, and Latinx communities [[3]]. Even professionals providing essential psychological support were not immune. A survey of New Zealand psychologists found that 70% reported increased work stress and 60% saw a rise in caseload intensity, with high levels of burnout and secondary traumatic stress being common [[24]]. Despite this immense strain, over 90% of the surveyed psychologists had no intention of leaving the profession, suggesting a combination of dedication and a lack of viable alternatives in a constrained labor market [[24]].

In response to these immense pressures, research has begun to explore the psychological resources that foster resilience and adaptation. Coping mechanisms have emerged as a critical area of study. For instance, among adolescents, meaning-focused coping was found to buffer the negative effects of climate distress on pro-environmental behavior, suggesting that finding purpose can be a protective factor during periods of societal stress [[23]]. Similarly, in the tourism sector, employee resilience was shown to moderate the negative impact of job insecurity on mental health [[11]]. Organizational resilience, supported by corporate social responsibility initiatives, positively influenced business performance and helped sustain operations during the crisis [[11]]. The concept of "psychological capital"—encompassing hope, efficacy, resilience, and optimism—is gaining traction as a framework for understanding how individuals and organizations can thrive amidst adversity. For example, satisfaction with an organization's pandemic response was linked to enhanced employee psychological capital [[11]]. The pandemic has thus shifted the focus of well-being research from simply measuring deficits to understanding the active processes of adaptation, resilience, and thriving in the face of systemic disruption. This requires moving beyond individual-level interventions to consider broader social, economic, and environmental factors that shape people's lives and capacities for well-being.

## Economic Disruption and the Path to Recovery

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the most severe global economic crisis in over a century, inflicting damage on a scale not seen since the Great Depression [[12]]. The crisis was transmitted primarily through global supply chains and a collapse in consumer demand, leading to historic contractions in production, trade, and employment. Global GDP contracted by 3.0% in 2020 after a modest 2.8% increase in 2019, marking a dramatic reversal of fortune [[8]]. The severity of the downturn was directly linked to government-imposed lockdowns, with panel data for 90 countries showing a significant negative correlation between the stringency of restrictions and GDP growth [[8]]. The economic contagion spread rapidly through global trade networks, with the collapse in export demand contributing substantially to the GDP declines, particularly in poorer nations dependent on commodity exports [[8]]. The strain on the global economy was quantifiable through indices like the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, which peaked twice during the pandemic—in April 2020 and December 2021—indicating extreme disruptions to logistics and manufacturing [[18]].

The pandemic's impact was starkly differentiated across economies and industries. Manufacturing- and export-oriented economies fared relatively better, whereas service- and tourism-dependent ones suffered immensely [[8]]. The United Nations World Tourism Organization declared 2020 the worst year in history for tourism, with international arrivals plummeting by 87% compared to the previous year and tourism receipts falling by 64% [[11]]. The localized impact could be devastating; Shanghai’s four-month lockdown in 2022 led to a 61.5% year-on-year drop in industrial output, with sectors like transport equipment manufacturing and residential services suffering massive value-added losses that rippled out to other provinces like Zhejiang and Guangdong [[19]]. At the micro level, businesses faced existential threats. Small firms had cash reserves for only 53 days on average, while larger enterprises had slightly more at 65 days, a precarious situation given the prolonged nature of the disruptions [[12]]. This led to a surge in temporary unemployment, which was significantly higher in 70% of countries for workers with only a primary education, widening the chasm of inequality [[12]].

In response, governments implemented unprecedented fiscal and monetary policies. High-income countries launched large stimulus measures proportional to their GDP, such as the U.S. CARES Act, which provided direct payments of up to $1,200 per adult to mitigate income shocks [[12,18]]. Low-income countries, however, had minimal or no fiscal responses due to debt constraints and limited access to credit [[12]]. Central banks engaged in asset purchases to stabilize financial markets [[12]]. While necessary to prevent a complete economic meltdown, these emergency policies came at a steep price, dramatically increasing public and private debt, which poses long-term risks to equitable recovery [[12]]. Looking forward, the path to recovery is fraught with challenges. A critical issue is the potential for a rebound in emissions. Economists warned that a mere one-year delay in investments in renewable energy would completely negate the emission reductions seen in the spring of 2020, highlighting the urgent need to integrate climate policy into all economic stimulus packages [[5]]. The pandemic has forced a reckoning with the fragility of globalized systems, prompting discussions around reshoring critical manufacturing, such as semiconductors and batteries, to enhance national security and reduce unemployment [[18]]. Initiatives like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) signal a global push towards building more resilient and secure supply chains, acknowledging that economic stability in the future will depend on strategic diversification and domestic investment [[18]].

## Interconnections and Feedback Loops: An Integrated Analysis

The true complexity of the COVID-19 pandemic lies not in its singular impact on any one domain, but in the intricate web of interconnections and feedback loops that linked the psychological, economic, and environmental spheres. The crisis was not a series of isolated events but a cascade of mutually reinforcing pressures that amplified one another, creating a system-wide challenge that defied simple solutions. The most profound of these connections is the bidirectional relationship between economic hardship and psychological well-being. On one hand, economic shocks precipitated a surge in psychological distress. Job insecurity was a powerful predictor of increased psychological distress in the early stages of the pandemic [[17]], and the closure of businesses and loss of income left millions of households unable to sustain basic consumption [[12]]. On the other hand, the psychological toll of the pandemic, including widespread anxiety and depression, diminished economic productivity and placed immense strain on healthcare and social support systems [[7,24]]. This creates a vicious cycle where economic instability fuels mental illness, which in turn undermines the capacity of individuals and societies to recover economically.

This psychological-economic nexus had significant spillover effects on environmental consciousness and behavior. As individuals grappled with immediate survival concerns, longer-term environmental issues like climate change receded in importance. A study of Italian university students found that despite widespread agreement that the pandemic demonstrated humanity's capacity for change, the vast majority considered climate change to be a less urgent problem than the virus itself [[21]]. This suggests that acute crises can temporarily crowd out attention and resources from chronic ones. However, the reverse loop is also present. Pro-environmental behaviors, such as reducing travel and consumption, were often driven by pandemic-era restrictions, which paradoxically improved air quality and contributed to avoided deaths from pollution [[5]]. This experience may have served as a powerful, albeit unintended, lesson in the co-benefits of sustainable action. Yet, the same study noted that atmospheric chemistry is nonlinear, and reductions in some pollutants like NOx could lead to increases in others like ozone, complicating the net environmental effect [[5]].

The global nature of the pandemic further exposed and exacerbated deep-seated inequalities, creating feedback loops that perpetuated disadvantage. The economic crisis disproportionately harmed women, youth, and informal sector workers, who were least able to cope with income loss and job insecurity [[12]]. This economic precarity, in turn, had a direct and severe impact on their quality of life and mental health [[13,17]]. Simultaneously, the environmental crisis unfolded along similar lines of injustice. Ecological harms, such as increased Amazon deforestation and poaching due to reduced tourism patrols, fell heaviest on regions and communities with the least capacity to respond [[3]]. This demonstrates how a single shock can trigger multiple forms of harm that reinforce each other. The pandemic also accelerated the adoption of digital technologies, which created new opportunities for remote work and education but also widened the digital divide, creating new vectors of inequality. The failure of the U.S. to source critical components like semiconductors domestically, relying on foreign suppliers instead, became a major economic vulnerability during the crisis, forcing a re-evaluation of global supply chain dependencies and highlighting a critical point of failure in the modern economy [[18]]. These interconnected failures—from public health to economic security and environmental protection—demand a holistic approach to recovery that recognizes and actively works to break these negative feedback loops.

## Future Directions: Addressing Gaps and Charting a New Course

As the world transitions from crisis management to long-term recovery and reconstruction, the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic must inform a new research agenda and a more integrated approach to policy-making. The pandemic has conclusively demonstrated that the old siloed approach, where health, environment, and economy are treated as separate domains, is insufficient for addressing today's complex challenges. A critical next step is to move beyond documenting the impacts and begin designing solutions that build genuine resilience across all three pillars. This requires a fundamental reframing of sustainability, not as a distant goal to be achieved, but as an adaptive process of managing uncertainty and building robust systems capable of withstanding future shocks. The research must therefore shift towards studying not just the consequences of disruption, but the mechanisms of recovery, adaptation, and transformation.

One of the most pressing research gaps lies in understanding the long-term psychological and behavioral consequences of the pandemic. While we have snapshots of distress and behavior during the crisis, longitudinal studies are needed to track these trends over decades. Key questions remain unanswered: How will the trauma and economic scars of the pandemic shape the values and aspirations of a generation? Will the experience of shared crisis foster a greater sense of social solidarity and collective responsibility, or will it deepen cynicism and individualism? Furthermore, research must delve deeper into the nuances of sustainability. The finding that environmental and social sustainability indicators are strongly linked to happiness, while economic factors are not, warrants far more investigation [[4]]. Future studies should explore how to operationalize this insight, developing metrics and policies that prioritize well-being and equity over pure economic growth. There is also a need for more cross-cultural research to understand how different societies have coped and adapted, moving beyond the current bias towards the Global North [[22]].

Methodologically, the field must embrace more interdisciplinary and mixed-methods approaches. The successful integration of qualitative methods like ethnography and photovoice can help capture the lived realities of people in diverse contexts, providing the depth that quantitative data often lacks [[3]]. This is particularly important for understanding the experiences of marginalized groups who were disproportionately affected by the pandemic [[3,12]]. Additionally, there is a need to close the gap between research practice and recommended norms, such as by increasing the use of open science practices and replication studies to enhance the credibility and generalizability of findings [[22]]. The concept of "habit architecture" offers a promising new direction, suggesting that urban design and infrastructure can be leveraged to foster sustainable habits on a large scale [[26]]. Research should investigate how this concept can be applied in different cultural and economic contexts to create systemic change. Finally, academic institutions and funding bodies must recognize and reward research that contributes to long-term capacity building and societal impact, rather than prioritizing short-term publication outputs [[10]]. By fostering equitable partnerships, supporting early-career researchers, and valuing non-traditional contributions, the scientific community can better align its work with the urgent needs of society. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic serves as a brutal but clear-sighted teacher. It has shown us our vulnerabilities and offered a glimpse of alternative futures. The challenge for the coming decade is to learn from this painful lesson and build a world that is not only more resilient in the face of future crises but also more just, sustainable, and humane.
