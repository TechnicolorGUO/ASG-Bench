      "content": "The environmental sciences, encompassing fields from ecology and conservation biology to climate change research and pollution studies, are characterized by a vast and growing body of primary research. This proliferation of data, while promising, presents a significant challenge: synthesizing disparate findings to generate robust, generalizable conclusions. In this context, meta-analysis has emerged as an indispensable quantitative tool for evidence-based practice and scientific inquiry [[12]]. First introduced in the 1970s, it was conceived as a rigorous method to synthesize research results, resolve conflicting findings, and build cumulative knowledge [[12]]. The discipline celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2017, marking four decades of profound methodological evolution and interdisciplinary application [[12]]. The core principle of meta-analysis is to systematically identify, appraise, and statistically combine the results of multiple independent studies to arrive at a more precise and powerful conclusion than could be derived from any single study alone. Foundational works by Glass (1976) and Smith & Glass (1977) laid the groundwork for modern meta-analytic techniques, establishing effect sizes and pooling methods that remain central to the field today [[4]].\n\nHowever, the increasing reliance on meta-analysis has also brought to light a series of critical challenges that can compromise the validity of its conclusions. Among these, publication bias stands out as one of the most pernicious threats. Publication bias refers to a systemic preference for publishing studies with statistically significant or positive results, leading to the underrepresentation of negative or nonsignificant findings in the scientific literature [[1]]. This phenomenon creates a distorted view of reality, where the available evidence appears stronger and more consistent than it truly is. The issue was first formally recognized in 1956 by the editor of the *Journal of Abnormal Social Psychology* and was later quantified by Rosenthal's influential 'file-drawer problem,' which suggested that for every published study, there might be as many as 95 unpublished, nonsignificant ones [[1]]. The consequences of this bias are severe; one analysis estimated that up to 45% of an observed association could be attributable to publication bias [[1]]. The drivers of this bias are multifaceted, stemming from researcher behavior—such as a reluctance to submit negative results (with positive studies being up to ten times more likely to be submitted)—and journal policies, where editors may deem negative results as \"unriveting reading\" [[1]]. Furthermore, sponsorship and funding sources, such as pharmaceutical companies suppressing unfavorable trial results, have been shown to exert a significant influence on what gets published [[1]].\n\nThe high degree of heterogeneity inherent in ecological and environmental data compounds the challenges of conducting a valid meta-analysis. Unlike clinical trials where populations can often be homogenized, environmental systems are complex, with immense variation across biological traits, geographical locations, temporal scales, and methodologies. It is widely acknowledged that ecological meta-analyses exhibit extreme levels of heterogeneity, with average *I²* values often approaching 90% [[3,8]]. This substantial unexplained variance means that simply averaging effect sizes without accounting for their sources can lead to meaningless or misleading conclusions. Compounding this is the pervasive issue of non-independence, where multiple effect sizes may be drawn from a single primary study (e.g., due to shared controls), or where species are phylogenetically related [[3,7]]. Ignoring these dependencies violates the standard statistical assumptions of independence, leading to deflated standard errors, artificially narrow confidence intervals, and an inflated risk of Type I errors [[6]]. Despite the recognition of these problems, their resolution remains an active area of intense research.\n\nThis review provides a comprehensive systematic literature review on the quantitative methods of meta-analysis, meta-regression, and publication bias tests within the context of environmental sciences. Its objectives are threefold: first, to map the historical development and current state-of-the-art methods for addressing publication bias and other key challenges; second, to critically evaluate the execution and reporting quality of meta-analyses in the field; and third, to synthesize emerging advanced techniques and chart future research directions. By integrating findings from diverse subfields, including ecology, evolutionary biology, and environmental health, this paper aims to serve as a practical guide for researchers seeking to conduct and interpret more rigorous and reliable meta-analytic syntheses."

      "content": "A thorough understanding of meta-analysis requires familiarity with a suite of foundational concepts and statistical methods. These tools form the bedrock upon which all subsequent analyses are built, from calculating effect sizes to modeling heterogeneity and correcting for bias. The process begins with the calculation of an effect size, a standardized metric that allows for the comparison and combination of results from different studies, even when they used different measurement scales or designs. Common effect size metrics in environmental science include Cohen’s *d*, Hedges’ *g* for standardized mean differences, the log response ratio (lnRR) for comparing means, and correlation coefficients [[3,14]]. For example, a meta-analysis on the impact of COVID-19 confinement policies on noise levels utilized averaged noise-level change samples from individual studies to quantify the overall effect [[17]]. The choice of effect size is critical, as it dictates the appropriate weighting scheme and subsequent analytical models. More specialized metrics have also been developed, such as the natural logarithm of the coefficient of variation ratio (lnCVR), proposed specifically for comparing variability between groups in ecological and evolutionary contexts [[9]].\n\nOnce effect sizes are calculated, the next step is to pool them into a single, summary estimate. This is not a simple arithmetic mean but rather a weighted average, where each study's contribution is weighted by the precision of its estimate. Typically, this involves weighting by the inverse of the sampling variance, giving more weight to larger, more precise studies [[7,10]]. This process of pooling yields two main types of models: fixed-effect and random-effects. A fixed-effect model assumes that there is one true effect size underlying all the studies and that any observed differences are due only to sampling error. In contrast, a random-effects model, which is almost universally more appropriate in environmental sciences, assumes that the true effect sizes vary from study to study and seeks to estimate the average of these true effects [[5]]. This model incorporates both within-study sampling error and between-study heterogeneity, providing a more conservative and realistic summary of the evidence.\n\nTo assess the amount of heterogeneity present, several statistics are used. The most common is the *I²* statistic, which quantifies the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. As noted, *I²* values in ecology can be exceptionally high, often exceeding 90%, underscoring the near-universal need for random-effects models [[3,8]]. However, a survey of 96 meta-analyses found that only 28% reported any measure of heterogeneity, indicating a significant gap in best-practice implementation [[10]].\n\nPublication bias detection relies on a set of distinct graphical and statistical methods. Graphical methods like funnel plots provide a visual assessment of asymmetry, which can indicate missing small studies with null or negative results [[2,3]]. Statistically, Egger's regression test is a widely used method that formally tests for this funnel plot asymmetry by regressing the effect size against its precision [[2,3]]. Other classic methods include Begg's rank correlation test and Duval & Tweedie's trim-and-fill procedure, which imputes the likely number of missing studies on the funnel plot and recalculates the pooled effect [[2,3]]. Fail-safe N calculations, such as the Orwin method, estimate how many additional nonsignificant studies would be needed to nullify the observed effect [[2,3]]. For a detailed overview of the prevalence of these methods in recent ecological and evolutionary meta-analyses, see Table 1.\n\n| Publication Bias Test | Prevalence in Ecological/Evolutionary Meta-Analyses (%) | Source |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Funnel Plots | ~50% | [[3]] |\n| Egger's Regression / Rank Correlation | ~10% | [[3]] |\n| Fail-Safe N (Rosenthal/Orwin) | 14.1% | [[3]] |\n| Trim-and-Fill | 7.5% | [[3]] |\n| Selection Models / p-uniform | Rarely used (0% - 1.4%) | [[3]] |\n\nThese foundational methods represent the starting point for any credible meta-analysis. However, their application must be carefully considered, especially in the face of the complex data structures and biases endemic to the environmental sciences."

      "heading": "Historical Development and Current Challenges in Execution",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The history of meta-analysis in the environmental sciences is one of gradual adoption and evolving standards, marked by a persistent gap between its potential and its actual execution. While the formal methodology was established in the 1970s [[4]], its application in ecology and related fields gained momentum later. A pivotal moment was the establishment of the Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems (EOLSS) and the subsequent push for evidence-based conservation. This led to the development of reporting guidelines to improve transparency and quality. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement provided a general template, which was then adapted specifically for ecology and evolution as PRISMA-EcoEvo [[7,14]]. These guidelines mandate the transparent reporting of search strategies, inclusion criteria, data extraction processes, and risk of bias assessments, serving as a crucial framework for improving methodological rigor.\n\nDespite the availability of these guidelines and foundational methodological texts [[10]]<URLHigginsGreen2011>, the execution of meta-analyses in the environmental sciences has historically lagged. A stark illustration of this gap comes from a 2013 evaluation of 133 articles published between 1992 and 2011, which found that only 45% (60 articles) fulfilled all technical requirements for a proper meta-analysis. These requirements included correct calculation of effect sizes, weighting by precision, pooling of effect sizes, and the presentation of confidence intervals [[10]]. Even more concerning, only one article met both the technical and qualitative standards, which would include assessing heterogeneity and presenting a forest plot [[10]]. This study also revealed a troubling trend: a positive correlation between the journal's impact factor and the technical rating of the meta-analysis, suggesting that higher-profile journals may prioritize novelty over methodological rigor [[10]]. Another survey confirmed this weakness, finding that only 28% of evaluated meta-analyses quantified heterogeneity and a mere 4% presented a forest plot [[10]].\n\nThe contemporary landscape shows some improvement but also highlights new, more sophisticated challenges. A 2022 review of 18 papers assessing ecological meta-analysis quality found that while reporting quality had improved, execution quality remained poor [[7]]. Only 66% of meta-analyses acknowledged the presence of non-independence in their data, and among those, the solutions were often inadequate. The most common approach was to select or average effect sizes to create a single data point per primary study, a method that leads to a significant loss of information and statistical power [[7]]. A more fundamental issue is the failure to account for the complex hierarchical structure of ecological data. A survey cited in a 2025 study found that a mere 9% of environmental meta-analyses accounted for dependence in sampling errors, a critical flaw given its prevalence [[6]]. This lack of rigorous modeling extends to the very foundation of the analysis, with less than half of reviews testing for publication bias [[7]].\n\nThese execution failures are compounded by a range of biases that can contaminate meta-analytic results. Beyond publication bias, other issues include database bias (missing studies indexed in certain databases), language bias (excluding non-English studies), location bias (focusing on specific geographic regions), and taxonomic chauvinism (over-researching popular taxa at the expense of others) [[4,14]]. A simulation study demonstrated the severity of these issues, showing a significant positive linear relationship between the proportion of studies missed by a search and the deviation in the resulting mean effect sizes [[4]]. In 35% of the meta-analyses studied, there were significant differences between the effect sizes of indexed versus non-indexed studies, highlighting a high risk of bias from restricted searches [[4]]. Even with exhaustive efforts to find grey literature, a 2025 re-extraction of 5,703 effect sizes from 41 meta-analyses on sexual signals found that at least 10% of relevant primary studies were undetected, and that qualitative differences existed in 15.4% of cases [[11]]. This persistent challenge underscores that achieving a truly unbiased synthesis of the literature remains a formidable task, requiring not just better methods but also greater investment in comprehensive and transparent data collection and reporting practices."

      "level": 2,
      "content": "In response to the well-documented challenges of heterogeneity and non-independence, the field of meta-analysis has seen the development of a new generation of sophisticated statistical techniques. These advanced methods move beyond the limitations of traditional approaches, offering more accurate and nuanced ways to model complex data structures and extract meaningful insights. The most significant of these advancements is the adoption of multilevel (or mixed-effects) meta-analysis models. These models are designed to explicitly handle the hierarchical nature of data commonly found in environmental research, where multiple effect sizes may be nested within the same primary study or, in comparative analyses, where species are related through a shared evolutionary history [[3,13]]. By incorporating random effects for different levels of the hierarchy (e.g., species, primary study, author), multilevel models can partition the total variance into its constituent parts, providing more accurate estimates of both the overall effect and the degree of heterogeneity at each level. Simulation studies have shown that multilevel models produce unbiased regression coefficient estimates and accurate variance component estimates when a sampling error variance–covariance (VCV) matrix is properly incorporated to account for within-study correlations [[6]].\n\nAnother groundbreaking advancement is the development of location-scale meta-analysis and meta-regression [[8]]. This framework represents a paradigm shift by moving beyond the simple modeling of the average effect (the \"location\") to also model the variance of effect sizes (the \"scale\"). This is particularly important because heteroscedasticity—the variation in effect size variability—is a hallmark of ecological data. Location-scale models allow researchers to use moderators to explain not only why the average effect differs across conditions but also why the consistency of that effect varies. For instance, one could test whether a particular experimental manipulation increases the mean effect size (a location effect) or decreases the variability around that effect (a scale effect). This dual modeling capability allows for the detection of novel forms of publication bias. A \"small-study effect\" (where smaller studies show larger effects) can be modeled as a location effect, while a \"small-study divergence\" (where smaller studies show more variable effects) is a scale effect [[8]]. This framework can also integrate phylogenetic structures using correlation matrices, allowing for the simultaneous modeling of biological and methodological variation [[8,13]].\n\nFurther extending these capabilities is the concept of phylogenetic multivariate meta-analysis (PMMA). This technique adapts the principles of phylogenetic comparative methods to the meta-analytic framework, enabling the joint analysis of multiple, correlated outcomes (function-valued traits) while accounting for the non-independence due to shared ancestry [[14]]. This is a critical advance, as many ecological questions involve multiple traits or responses that evolve in concert. PMMA allows for the investigation of complex adaptive landscapes and trait correlations across a phylogeny, providing a much richer understanding of macroevolutionary patterns than could be achieved by analyzing traits in isolation [[14]]. The statistical identity of phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models (PGLMMs) and phylogenetic multilevel meta-analyses further solidifies the integration of these two powerful analytical traditions [[13,14]].\n\nFinally, advanced methods for handling dependent effect sizes are becoming more prevalent. Cluster-robust variance estimation (CRVE) is a technique designed to provide valid statistical inference (i.e., correct Type I error rates) even when the assumption of independence is violated. CRVE methods adjust the standard errors of the model coefficients to account for clustering, making them useful when the cluster structure is known but difficult to model directly [[6]]. However, current implementations of CRVE have been shown to fail in certain complex scenarios, such as crossed-random-effects designs common in ecological data involving both species and spatial locations, where they can inflate Type I error rates [[6]]. This highlights the ongoing need for careful methodological consideration and the importance of validating assumptions when applying these advanced techniques. The table below summarizes the key features of these modern methods.\n\n| Technique | Core Purpose | How It Works | Key Strengths | Limitations | Source(s) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Multilevel Models** | Account for data hierarchies (e.g., ESs within studies, species within phylogeny). | Incorporate multiple levels of random effects. Can use a VCV matrix for sampling errors. | Provides unbiased estimates for hierarchical data; partitions variance accurately. | Computationally intensive; requires a good understanding of the data structure. | [[3,6,13]] |\n| **Location-Scale Models** | Model both the mean (\"location\") and variance (\"scale\") of effect sizes. | Extends random-effects models to include moderators for the scale component. | Detects novel forms of bias (divergence, Proteus); explains heteroscedasticity. | More complex to implement and interpret; software can be demanding. | [[8]] |\n| **Phylogenetic Multivariate Meta-Analysis (PMMA)** | Jointly analyze multiple correlated traits while accounting for phylogeny. | Combines phylogenetic comparative methods with multivariate meta-analysis. | Handles function-valued traits; accounts for complex evolutionary relationships. | Requires complete phylogenetic information; computationally challenging. | [[14]] |\n| **Cluster-Robust Variance Estimation (CRVE)** | Provide valid inference when effect sizes are dependent. | Adjusts standard errors to account for clustering, without needing to model the dependency directly. | Robust to misspecification of the correlation structure; flexible. | Can inflate Type I errors in complex designs (e.g., crossed random effects); may be less efficient. | [[6]] |\n\nThese state-of-the-art techniques are transforming meta-analysis from a simple averaging exercise into a powerful tool for complex systems analysis. Their adoption is essential for producing credible and insightful syntheses in the environmental sciences."

      "content": "Meta-analysis has become an integral part of the environmental scientist's toolkit, applied to a wide array of topics to synthesize evidence, inform policy, and generate novel hypotheses. The applications span multiple scales, from molecular mechanisms to ecosystem-level impacts, demonstrating the versatility of the methodology. One prominent area is agricultural science, where meta-analyses are used to evaluate the efficacy of sustainable farming practices. The iMAP-FP dataset, for example, was created through a systematic review of existing meta-analyses to develop a harmonized evidence base for 34 different farming practice categories relevant to the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy [[16]]. This involved developing specific search equations for each practice, screening thousands of records against strict PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) criteria, and extracting quantitative results to compare the agronomical, environmental, and climatic impacts of practices like organic farming versus conventional agriculture [[16]]. Such large-scale syntheses provide policymakers with a direct, evidence-based comparison of management options.\n\nAnother critical application is in pollution studies, where meta-analysis helps quantify the impact of human activities on ecosystems. A notable case study examined the effect of COVID-19 confinement policies on environmental noise levels [[17]]. Researchers synthesized 148 averaged noise-level change samples from 31 studies to show a significant reduction in ambient noise. A meta-regression analysis further revealed that the magnitude of this reduction was significantly related to the stringency of government lockdown measures, with continuous sound pressure levels showing a particularly strong negative relationship (β = −0.55) [[17]]. Subgroup analyses also identified that the effect was strongest in quiet areas compared to traffic-dominated ones, providing granular insights for urban planning and environmental regulation [[17]].\n\nIn the realm of toxicology and human health, meta-analysis is increasingly used to integrate big data from various sources to establish causal links between environmental exposures and adverse outcomes. A review on the use of meta-analysis in environmental health highlighted the integration of toxicogenomics (TGx) data with classical epidemiological data within the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework [[15]]. Here, TGx data can be used to validate molecular initiating events (MIEs), which are the first key event in a pathway leading to an adverse outcome. By combining this mechanistic data with population-level health data, meta-analysis serves as a robust tool for building and validating causal chains from pollutant exposure to disease [[15]].\n\nEven highly specialized ecological questions are addressed through meta-analysis. A re-examination of meta-analyses on sexual signals in ecology and evolution involved the painstaking re-extraction of 5,703 effect sizes from 246 primary studies to test for reproducibility and quantify discrepancies [[11]]. This work not only assessed the reliability of previous syntheses but also served as a case study on the challenges of data extraction itself, finding that even with adherence to PRISMA guidelines, at least 10% of relevant studies were initially undetected [[11]]. Similarly, meta-analysis of host-parasite interactions has been used to investigate the hypothesis that parasites manipulate host behavior, with one analysis focusing on changes in behavioral variability as a potential mechanism [[9]]. This demonstrates how meta-analysis can be used to test nuanced predictions about biological phenomena. Phylogenetic comparative meta-analyses have also been applied to study avian longevity across thousands of communities, modeling community-level effects while accounting for spatial dependence and phylogenetic relationships [[14]]. These diverse applications illustrate that meta-analysis is no longer a niche statistical exercise but a mainstream scientific method capable of tackling some of the most pressing questions in environmental science."

      "heading": "Advanced Methodologies for Publication Bias and Data Dependence",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Addressing publication bias and data dependence are arguably the most critical tasks in modern meta-analysis, particularly in the environmental sciences where these issues are deeply entrenched. The field has moved beyond simplistic solutions towards a suite of more robust and sophisticated methodologies designed to detect, model, and adjust for these biases. For publication bias, the focus has shifted from relying on a single test to employing a multi-faceted sensitivity analysis strategy [[3]]. While classic methods like funnel plots and Egger's regression remain common, their limitations are well understood, especially their low statistical power to detect bias and their susceptibility to being confounded by true heterogeneity [[3]]. Consequently, researchers are increasingly turning to more advanced adjustment methods. A 2025 simulation study by Almalik evaluated five such methods—the Copas selection model, p-uniform, PET-PEESE, Trim and Fill, and Limit Meta-Analysis—and found significant differences in performance [[5]]. The Copas selection model consistently showed lower mean squared error and higher coverage probability, making it a more reliable choice for adjusting effect sizes under equal variance conditions [[5]]. In contrast, methods like Trim and Fill were found to offer moderate bias correction but suboptimal coverage, while PET-PEESE exhibited high bias and variable performance [[5]]. This study underscores the necessity of not relying on a single method but instead running multiple adjustments and comparing their results.\n\nPerhaps the most significant innovation in this domain is the development of location-scale meta-analysis, which reframes publication bias not just as a problem of missing small studies but as a pattern in the data itself [[8]]. This framework introduces distinct tests for different forms of bias. A \"small-study effect,\" where smaller studies report larger effects, is tested as a location effect. However, a \"small-study divergence,\" where smaller studies show more variable effects, is a scale effect [[8]]. This distinction is crucial, as it allows for a more precise diagnosis of the type of bias present. Furthermore, it enables the testing of the \"Proteus effect,\" where the sign of the effect reverses in smaller studies, another subtle form of bias that traditional methods might miss [[8]]. This approach, implemented in R packages like `brms` and `metafor`, provides a far more comprehensive toolbox for investigating and correcting for publication-related distortions [[8]].\n\nSimultaneously, the challenge of data dependence, driven by multiple effect sizes per study or phylogenetic relationships, is being tackled with equally sophisticated modeling techniques. As previously discussed, multilevel models are now the standard for handling this complexity [[3,6]]. These models can explicitly incorporate a variance-covariance matrix of sampling errors, which captures the dependencies arising from shared controls or other design features within a primary study [[6]]. This is a significant improvement over ad-hoc methods like selecting or averaging effect sizes, which discard valuable information [[7]]. An alternative and complementary approach is cluster-robust variance estimation (CRVE), which adjusts the standard errors of the model coefficients to be robust to arbitrary forms of clustering, without needing to specify the exact correlation structure [[6]]. While powerful, CRVE is not a panacea. Recent research has shown that current implementations can fail to control Type I error rates in complex phylogenetic models with crossed random effects, cautioning against its uncritical application [[6]]. This highlights a critical open problem: the need for CRVE methods that can adequately handle the complex, crossed-random-effects structures typical of ecological data [[6]]. The combination of these advanced bias detection and data-dependence modeling techniques represents the frontier of meta-analytic methodology, offering a path toward more credible and defensible syntheses in the environmental sciences."

      "content": "In conclusion, this review has traced the evolution of meta-analysis from a nascent quantitative technique to a cornerstone of evidence-based environmental science. The journey has been marked by significant progress in methodological sophistication, with the development of powerful tools to address long-standing challenges of heterogeneity and non-independence. The advent of multilevel models, location-scale frameworks, and phylogenetic meta-analysis has transformed the discipline, enabling researchers to move beyond simple averaging and engage in complex systems-level analyses that respect the intricate structure of ecological data [[6,8,14]]. Similarly, the development of advanced publication bias detection and correction methods, such as the Copas selection model and location-scale models, provides a more nuanced and robust arsenal for ensuring the integrity of meta-analytic conclusions [[5,8]].\n\nHowever, this progress exists in a paradoxical context. While the methods to conduct rigorous meta-analyses are more advanced than ever before, the execution of these methods in practice lags significantly behind. The persistent findings of poor execution quality in the environmental literature—a lack of heterogeneity assessment, the use of ad-hoc methods to deal with non-independence, and insufficient testing for publication bias—indicate a deep-seated disconnect between available knowledge and real-world application [[7,10]]. This gap is not merely a matter of oversight; it reflects deeper challenges, including the complexity of the required analyses, the time-consuming nature of comprehensive data collection, and a historical culture that has prioritized novel discovery over methodological rigor.\n\nLooking forward, several key gaps and future directions emerge. The most pressing challenge is bridging the gap between advanced methodology and routine practice. This requires a concerted effort from educators, journal editors, and the research community to champion and enforce higher standards of reporting and execution, leveraging guidelines like PRISMA-EcoEvo [[14]]. Training programs and accessible tutorials are essential to equip the next generation of environmental scientists with the skills to apply these complex models correctly [[7]].\n\nSecond, the field must continue to innovate in the face of new data types and research questions. The integration of meta-analysis with other complex data streams, such as toxicogenomics and functional genomics within the AOP framework, opens exciting new avenues for mechanistic understanding [[15]]. Developing methods to handle these high-dimensional and heterogeneous data types will be a major focus of future research.\n\nThird, there is a need for further validation and refinement of the current state-of-the-art techniques. While methods like multilevel models are superior to older ones, their performance can still be affected by factors like small numbers of studies or specific types of dependency structures [[3]]. Continued simulation studies are needed to understand the operating characteristics of these models under a wider range of realistic conditions. Similarly, the limitations of CRVE in phylogenetic contexts highlight the urgent need to develop variance estimation techniques that are robust to the complex, crossed-random-effects structures common in ecology [[6]].\n\nFinally, the ultimate goal of meta-analysis is to inform decision-making and policy. Future research should focus on enhancing the translational capacity of meta-analytic findings. This includes developing methods for dynamic syntheses that can rapidly update evidence bases (like the iMAP-FP project) and creating user-friendly platforms that make high-quality evidence accessible to policymakers, conservation managers, and other stakeholders [[16]]. To summarize, the future of meta-analysis in the environmental sciences lies in a synergistic combination of continued methodological innovation, rigorous implementation of existing best practices, and a steadfast commitment to using synthesized evidence to solve real-world environmental problems.\n\n---"
