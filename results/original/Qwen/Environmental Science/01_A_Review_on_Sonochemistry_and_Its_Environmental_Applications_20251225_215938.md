## Introduction and Research Objectives

Sonochemistry, the chemistry driven by ultrasound, represents a powerful and versatile field that harnesses acoustic energy to induce or accelerate chemical transformations. The fundamental principle lies in the phenomenon of acoustic cavitation, where ultrasonic waves (typically at frequencies above 20 kHz) propagate through a liquid medium, creating regions of low pressure that lead to the formation of microbubbles [[3,12]]. These bubbles grow and subsequently collapse violently under high-pressure cycles, generating localized extreme conditions within them: temperatures can soar to several thousand Kelvin, pressures can exceed 1000 atmospheres, and cooling rates can reach millions of degrees per second [[3,12,15]]. This process creates transient "hot spots" that serve as unique reaction vessels, enabling chemical reactions that are otherwise inaccessible under conventional thermal or photochemical conditions. The emitted light from this process, known as sonoluminescence, was first observed in 1934 by Hermann Frenzel and his colleagues, who witnessed light-emitting bubbles in an ultrasonic water bath during their research on sonar technology [[2,5]]. This seminal observation marked one of the earliest experimental recognitions of the profound physical and chemical effects of ultrasound in liquids.

The motivation for this review stems from the dual nature of sonochemistry's impact on environmental science and engineering. On one hand, sonochemical processes have been developed into highly effective methods for treating hazardous waste and remediating contaminated environments. As a member of the Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) family, sonochemistry is particularly adept at degrading persistent organic pollutants, such as endocrine-disrupting compounds, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and dyes, which pose significant threats to ecosystems and human health [[4,8]]. The mechanism relies on the generation of highly reactive radicals, primarily hydroxyl (•OH), which non-selectively attack and mineralize these recalcitrant molecules into harmless small molecules like carbon dioxide and water [[6,7]]. This capability positions sonochemistry as a critical tool in the global effort to manage industrial effluents and improve water quality. In China alone, where sewage discharge reached 64.6 billion cubic meters in 2023, the need for advanced treatment technologies is acute [[14]].

On the other hand, the widespread industrial application of sonochemistry has been severely constrained by its inherent challenges, most notably its high energy consumption and difficulties in scale-up [[4,6,8]]. While laboratory experiments consistently demonstrate high removal efficiencies, translating these results into economically viable and energy-efficient industrial-scale operations remains a formidable hurdle. This dichotomy between proven efficacy and practical limitations presents a rich landscape for research and innovation. Consequently, this review paper aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic analysis of sonochemistry, with a specific focus on its environmental applications. The primary objectives are to dissect the fundamental mechanisms governing sonochemical reactions, to document the evolution of the field from its historical roots to current state-of-the-art techniques, and to critically evaluate its performance in various environmental remediation scenarios. Furthermore, this review seeks to identify the key challenges and open problems that impede its broader adoption and to explore emerging trends and future research directions that hold promise for overcoming these barriers. By synthesizing existing knowledge and highlighting critical gaps, this work intends to offer a valuable resource for researchers and engineers working to advance sonochemistry toward sustainable and scalable environmental solutions.

## Key Concepts and Fundamental Mechanisms

At the heart of sonochemistry lies the intricate interplay of physics and chemistry initiated by acoustic cavitation. Understanding this foundational mechanism is paramount to comprehending both the potential and the limitations of the technology. Acoustic cavitation is the process by which standing or traveling sound waves create voids or microbubbles in a liquid medium [[3]]. The cycle begins with the negative half-cycle of the sound wave, which creates a region of low pressure that can overcome the liquid's tensile strength, leading to the formation of a bubble nucleus, often in microscopic crevices or around suspended particles [[8]]. This initial stage is followed by the growth phase, where the bubble expands due to rectified diffusion—the net inward flow of vapor and dissolved gas into the bubble from the surrounding liquid—and inertial effects driven by the continued low-pressure phase [[6,8]]. Finally, during the high-pressure half-cycle of the wave, the external pressure overwhelms the internal pressure of the bubble, triggering its rapid and violent implosive collapse [[15]].

It is during this collapse that the true power of sonochemistry is unleashed. The collapse is so rapid that it is nearly adiabatic, meaning there is minimal heat exchange with the surroundings. This leads to the compression of the gas inside the bubble, generating immense localized energy. Theoretical calculations and experimental measurements have estimated that the temperature within the collapsing bubble can reach several thousand Kelvin (e.g., ~5200 K) and the pressure can exceed 1000 atmospheres [[3,6,7,15]]. These extreme conditions are responsible for three distinct but interconnected reaction zones that govern sonochemical activity. The first zone is the interior of the bubble itself. Here, under conditions of extreme temperature and pressure, molecules undergo pyrolysis, or thermal decomposition [[8,12]]. For instance, water molecules can be broken down directly into hydrogen and oxygen radicals. This pyrolytic pathway is particularly effective for volatile and hydrophobic compounds that partition into the bubble phase [[8]]. The second zone is the interface between the collapsing bubble and the bulk liquid. This thin shell of liquid surrounding the hot gas core experiences intense heating and becomes a hotspot for radical generation [[7]]. The third zone encompasses the bulk solution, where the reactive species generated in the first two zones diffuse and react with hydrophilic, non-volatile pollutants [[8]].

The generation of these reactive species, especially hydroxyl radicals (•OH), is central to sonochemistry's utility in environmental applications. The primary source of •OH radicals is the sonolysis of water at the bubble-liquid interface: H₂O + ))) → •OH + •H [[8]]. These •OH radicals are among the most potent oxidizing agents known, capable of reacting with almost all organic compounds. Alongside •OH, other radicals such as hydrogen radicals (•H), superoxide radicals (•O₂⁻), and hydroperoxyl radicals (HO₂•) are also formed through complex reactions involving the dissolved gases in the liquid [[6,15]]. The composition of the gas phase within the bubble—whether it is argon, air, or another gas—is a critical parameter that dictates the efficiency of sonochemical reactions. Monoatomic gases like argon are ideal for maximizing the temperature of the hot spot and enhancing pyrolysis, while air-saturated solutions favor the production of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and nitrogenous radicals, which are important for different types of oxidation pathways [[6,8]]. For example, studies show that halogenated compounds degrade more efficiently under an argon atmosphere, whereas non-halogenated compounds may benefit more from the presence of air [[2]].

Beyond these purely chemical effects, sonochemistry also induces significant mechanical forces. The asymmetric collapse of bubbles can generate high-speed liquid microjets that strike nearby surfaces with considerable force, while the collective effect of many bubbles collapsing simultaneously produces powerful shockwaves [[2,15]]. These phenomena, which dominate at lower ultrasonic frequencies (typically below 100 kHz), are responsible for processes like sono-crystallization, sono-degradation of polymers, and the remarkable hydromechanical shear forces that are exploited for sludge disintegration in wastewater treatment [[2,8]]. The distinction between chemical and mechanical effects is crucial for tailoring sonochemical reactors to specific applications. Low-frequency/high-power systems are designed to maximize these mechanical impacts, while high-frequency/low-power systems are optimized to enhance the generation of reactive radicals in the bubble interface [[3,12]]. This dual-action nature makes sonochemistry a uniquely versatile tool, capable of influencing both the chemical structure of molecules and the physical properties of materials.

| **Temperature** | 20–50°C (Typical range) | Higher temperatures reduce cavitation intensity and can alter reaction pathways. | [[7,13]] |
| **Power Intensity** | 0.01–10 W/cm² | Increases reaction rate up to a point, after which a "cushion effect" reduces efficiency. | [[8,15]] |

| **Pollutant Concentration** | Typically mg/L | Lower concentrations can increase radical utilization efficiency. | [[8]] |

## Historical Development and Milestones

The history of sonochemistry is a chronicle of scientific curiosity and technological innovation, tracing a path from early observations of acoustic anomalies to the sophisticated understanding of plasma-like phenomena within collapsing bubbles. The journey began long before the term "sonochemistry" was coined, rooted in the exploration of the physical effects of high-frequency sound. One of the earliest documented observations related to cavitation was humorously attributed to physicist Kirk McDonald, who suggested that Alfred Nobel's breakthrough in manufacturing nitroglycerine in 1865 might have been facilitated by sonoluminescence, with the explosion being triggered by pressure waves inducing cavitation [[5]]. While speculative, this highlights the long-standing, albeit unrecognized, connection between acoustic energy and powerful chemical change.

The formal scientific study of what would become sonochemistry took a decisive turn in 1927 when Alfred L. Loomis and his colleagues reported the first observation of sonoluminescence using high-frequency transducers [[12]]. Just seven years later, in 1934, the pivotal moment occurred at the University of Cologne. During their work on sonar, Hermann Frenzel and his student Heinzi Schultes placed an ultrasound transducer into aental technology.

## Current State-of-the-Art Techniques and Reactor Design

The current state of sonochemistry is characterized by sophisticated reactor designs and a nuanced understanding of operational parameters, enabling both fundamental research and targeted applications. The effectiveness of any sonochemical process is intrinsically linked to the reactor configuration, which dictates the spatial distribution and intensity of the cavitational field. The three most common types of reactors are probe systems (also called horns), bath systems, and flow-through cells, each offering distinct advantages and limitations [[8,15]]. Probe systems involve a transducer connected to a horn that is directly immersed into the reaction mixture, delivering high-intensity ultrasound (>1 W cm⁻²) to a localized volume [[15]]. This design is ideal for small-scale, high-energy-demand applications like nanoparticle synthesis or mechanistic studies but suffers from erosion of the horn tip and potential sample contamination. Bath systems, where the reaction vessel is placed in a tank filled with a coupling liquid surrounding an external transducer, provide a more gentle and indirect form of irradiation with lower intensity [[15]]. They are widely used for cleaning, cell disruption, and preliminary screening due to their ease of use and ability to handle multiple samples, but the energy transfer is less efficient and highly dependent on the position of the vessel within the bath. Flow-through reactors represent a significant advancement towards industrial scalability, allowing for continuous processing of liquids [[6,12]]. These systems can be designed as cylindrical cells with transducers mounted on the walls, ensuring more reproducible and uniform treatment as the fluid passes through the cavitational zone [[15]]. Continuous-flow systems are emerging as a more energy-efficient alternative to traditional batch processing, a critical factor for large-scale deployment [[6]].

The optimization of sonochemical processes relies on the precise control and reporting of several key operating parameters. Ultrasonic frequency is arguably the most significant parameter, as it fundamentally alters the nature of the cavitational effects [[6,8]]. Low-frequency ultrasound, typically in the range of 18-100 kHz, generates larger bubbles that collapse more violently, producing stronger mechanical effects such as microjets (up to 100 m s⁻¹) and shockwaves (up to 2000 m s⁻¹) [[3,15]]. This makes low-frequency systems particularly effective for applications dominated by hydromechanical shear forces, such as the disintegration of waste activated sludge (WAS) or the cleaning of surfaces [[6,8]]. In contrast, high-frequency ultrasound, generally above 100 kHz and extending into the MHz range, produces a greater number of smaller bubbles. This results in a higher yield of reactive radicals, particularly hydroxyl (•OH) radicals, making high-frequency systems optimal for chemical degradation processes classified as Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) [[3,6,7]]. Research indicates that radical generation peaks within an intermediate frequency range of 200–600 kHz for chemical effects, with a study finding that 300 kHz yielded faster degradation rates than either 20 kHz or 446 kHz [[8,13]]. High-frequency systems are also being explored for specialized applications; for instance, surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices, which generate GHz-frequency waves on piezoelectric substrates like LiNbO₃, enable drop-scale synthesis and high-resolution imaging [[3,12]].

Ultrasonic power and intensity are other critical parameters. Increasing the power input generally increases the reaction rate by generating more cavitation events [[15]]. However, this relationship is not linear, and a trade-off exists. At very high power levels, the "cushion effect" becomes dominant, where the excessive vapor produced during bubble expansion absorbs the energy of the incoming sound waves, dampening the collapse intensity and reducing overall efficiency [[8,15]]. Therefore, there is an optimal power input for any given system. To ensure accurate comparison between different studies and reactors, it is essential to measure the actual acoustic energy delivered to the system. Calorimetric power measurement, which calculates the energy dissipation based on the temperature rise of the liquid, is the most common and reliable method [[3,8]]. Chemical dosimetry, such as the Weissler reaction, provides a measure of the resulting chemical activity rather than the input energy [[3]]. Other important parameters include the temperature of the bulk liquid, which inversely affects cavitation intensity; the pH of the solution, which can influence the charge and stability of pollutants and intermediates; and the nature of the saturating gas, with monatomic gases like argon significantly enhancing radical yields compared to air [[2,8,13]]. The addition of solid particles, such as glass beads or catalysts, can also enhance cavitation by providing nucleation sites, although excessive solids can scatter the ultrasound and reduce efficiency [[8]]. Despite these advancements, a persistent challenge highlighted in the literature is the poor reproducibility of results due to inconsistent reporting of these fundamental parameters, such as calorimetric power, creating a significant knowledge gap [[7,15]].

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **Bath** | 35 - 45 kHz (typical) | Low to Medium | Easy to use, handles multiple samples, good for screening | Poor energy transfer, non-uniform field, position-dependent | Cleaning, cell lysis, preliminary degradation studies |

## Environmental Applications: Degradation of Pollutants and Hybrid Systems

Sonochemistry has emerged as a powerful tool for environmental remediation, primarily applied in the treatment of water and wastewater to degrade a wide array of persistent organic pollutants. The core principle leverages the generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), especially hydroxyl radicals (•OH), through the sonolysis of water, classifying it as an Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) [[6,8]]. This capability allows for the effective breakdown of micropollutants that are resistant to conventional biological treatment, including endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and azo dyes [[8,14]]. The degradation occurs through a combination of mechanisms: pyrolysis of volatile compounds within the hot bubble, radical attack at the gas-liquid interface, and oxidation by diffusing radicals in the bulk solution [[15]]. For example, high-frequency ultrasound (400 kHz) has demonstrated enhanced •OH generation and superior degradation efficiency for contaminants like Bisphenol A (BPA) [[7]]. The effectiveness of degradation is highly dependent on the pollutant's physicochemical properties; volatile and hydrophobic compounds are degraded more efficiently via pyrolysis, while hydrophilic compounds rely on radical attack [[8]]. Studies have shown that degradation kinetics can vary significantly with solution pH; for instance, aniline degrades optimally under alkaline conditions, whereas the degradation of 4-nitrophenol is hindered in alkaline environments [[13]].

Despite its efficacy, a major limitation of standalone ultrasound treatment is its high energy consumption, which severely limits its industrial feasibility for large-scale water treatment [[4,8]]. To overcome this barrier, the most significant trend in environmental sonochemistry is the development of hybrid or combinative systems that integrate ultrasound with other treatment technologies to achieve synergistic effects and dramatically improve energy efficiency [[4,13]]. These hybrid AOPs leverage the unique strengths of each component. A prominent example is the combination of ultrasound with chemical oxidants. Ultrasound can activate persulfates (S₂O₈²⁻) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), generating sulfate radicals (SO₄•⁻) and hydroxyl radicals, respectively, without the need for added catalysts or producing harmful by-products, enabling eco-friendly catalytic systems [[7]]. Similarly, combining ultrasound with the Fenton process creates a sono-Fenton system. The ultrasonic irradiation enhances the regeneration of Fe²⁺ from Fe³⁺, accelerates the decomposition of H₂O₂, and improves mass transfer, leading to a much higher rate of •OH radical production. An ultrasonic-electrochemical Fenton process has been shown to achieve up to 50% oxidation of the herbicide 2,4-D in just 60 seconds, demonstrating remarkable speed [[13]].

Another highly effective hybrid approach is the combination of ultrasound with ozone (O₃). This sono-ozonation process benefits from the fact that ultrasound enhances the mass transfer of ozone into the liquid and promotes the decomposition of O₃ into •OH radicals, significantly boosting oxidative capacity. Ultrasound is also being integrated with photocatalysis to create sonophotocatalytic systems. The collapse of cavitation bubbles can emit UV light (sonoluminescence in the 200–500 nm range), which is capable of exciting semiconductor photocatalysts like TiO₂, thereby initiating photocatalytic reactions [[8]]. Furthermore, ultrasound helps prevent the agglomeration of catalyst particles and continuously cleans their surface, maintaining high catalytic activity. Research trends identified through bibliometric analysis show a clear shift in focus: after initial work on coking wastewater and microwave-assisted processes, the dominant trend from 2016 to 2023 has been Fenton oxidation, reflecting the intense research effort into these hybrid AOPs [[14]]. Beyond water treatment, ultrasound finds application in soil remediation, often requiring combined methods such as coupling with ozone or supercritical CO₂ extraction to mobilize and degrade contaminants trapped in the soil matrix [[6]]. For air purification, ultrasound is used in acoustic agglomeration, where sound waves cause fine particulate matter to collide and coalesce into larger particles that are easier to remove from the airstream [[13]].

## Challenges in Scalability, Energy Efficiency, and Reproducibility

Despite the proven efficacy of sonochemistry in laboratory settings for a wide range of applications, its transition to widespread industrial implementation is hindered by three interconnected and profound challenges: scalability, energy efficiency, and reproducibility. These issues form the central bottleneck in the field and are the subject of ongoing critical analysis. The primary obstacle is the inherently high energy requirement of the process. Generating and sustaining the violent collapse of cavitation bubbles demands significant power input. This energy intensity renders standalone ultrasonic treatment economically unfeasible for large-scale applications like municipal wastewater treatment, where vast volumes of water must be processed [[4,8]]. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that a large portion of the input energy is dissipated as heat in the bulk liquid rather than being utilized for productive cavitation, a consequence of inefficient energy transfer and the cushioning effect at high power inputs [[8,15]]. While hybrid systems offer a path to improved energy efficiency by leveraging synergistic effects, the fundamental energy cost of generating ultrasound remains a critical concern [[4]].

Scalability is intrinsically linked to energy efficiency and presents its own set of complex engineering problems. Laboratory-scale reactors, such as probe systems or small baths, create a relatively uniform and intense cavitational field within a small volume [[15]]. However, scaling this up to treat industrial flows introduces severe non-linearities. The cavitational field becomes highly non-uniform, with "dead zones" receiving little to no ultrasound and areas of excessive intensity leading to inefficiency and equipment damage [[6,10]]. The penetration depth of ultrasound is limited, meaning that in large tanks, only a thin layer near the transducer is effectively treated. This necessitates the design of complex, large-scale reactor configurations, such as multi-horn arrays or sophisticated flow cells, which are expensive to build and maintain [[10]]. Efforts to address this have led to the development of continuous-flow systems, which are considered more promising for scale-up than batch processing, but designing them to ensure every unit of fluid receives a consistent and sufficient dose of ultrasound remains a significant challenge [[6]]. The successful industrial application of ultrasound is currently limited to niche areas, with sludge disintegration being one of the few examples where it has been scaled up, particularly effective with low-frequency ultrasound (20-40 kHz) for breaking down large soil flocs [[6,8]].

Reproducibility is perhaps the most insidious challenge, undermining the scientific rigor and comparability of research findings. The performance of a sonochemical process is exquisitely sensitive to a multitude of poorly reported parameters. The actual ultrasonic power delivered to the system, measured calorimetrically, is often not specified, with many studies only reporting the nominal power setting of the generator, which bears little relation to the real energy input [[3,8]]. The geometry of the reactor, the position of the transducer, the volume and shape of the vessel, and the liquid level all critically influence the standing wave pattern and the location of maximum cavitation intensity [[15]]. Without meticulous documentation of these factors, it is impossible to replicate an experiment. This lack of standardization has created a significant knowledge gap, making it difficult to compare results across different laboratories or to build reliable predictive models [[7,15]]. As a result, much of the published research focuses narrowly on removal efficiency, reporting impressive percentages without providing the necessary context of energy consumption (e.g., kWh/m³) or specific energy input (kJ/kg TS), metrics that are essential for assessing true cost-effectiveness and environmental impact [[7,14]]. For instance, while photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) achieved a 97% COD removal for spent caustic effluent, the specific energy consumption was a high 22.71 kWh/m³, highlighting the economic burden [[14]]. Overcoming these challenges requires a concerted effort from the scientific community to adopt standardized protocols for reporting experimental conditions, moving beyond simple removal efficiencies to prioritize metrics of energy consumption and sustainability [[7]]. Only then can the field make meaningful progress toward viable industrial solutions.

## Future Directions and Concluding Synthesis

The future of sonochemistry hinges on its ability to transcend the formidable challenges of energy efficiency, scalability, and reproducibility that currently confine its most impactful applications to the laboratory bench. While the fundamental science of acoustic cavitation is well-established, translating this knowledge into sustainable, large-scale environmental technologies requires a paradigm shift in research focus and methodology. The concluding synthesis of this review reveals that the path forward is not through incremental improvements to existing single-technology approaches, but through the strategic integration of sonochemistry into hybrid advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and the adoption of a holistic, systems-level perspective that prioritizes economic and environmental sustainability alongside technical performance.

Future research directions must be sharply focused on addressing the core limitations. First and foremost, the field must move beyond the myopic reporting of contaminant removal percentages. The paramount metric for future studies should be energy efficiency, explicitly quantified as specific energy consumption (kWh/m³ or kWh/kg of pollutant removed) [[7,14]]. Funding agencies and journals should mandate the reporting of calorimetrically measured power and detailed reactor specifications to ensure reproducibility and enable valid cross-study comparisons [[7,15]]. This shift will force researchers to confront the true cost of their processes and identify genuinely efficient technologies. Second, the development of hybrid systems represents the most promising avenue for innovation. Research should intensify on optimizing the synergy between ultrasound and complementary technologies like Fenton chemistry, ozonation, photocatalysis, and electrochemical processes [[4,13]]. Understanding the precise mechanisms of interaction—for example, how ultrasound enhances catalyst regeneration or promotes radical chain reactions—is key to designing next-generation reactors that maximize the utilization of every joule of energy input.

Third, the design of sonochemical reactors must evolve from art to science. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of acoustic fields and bubble dynamics, coupled with machine learning algorithms—an area currently unexplored in this context [[15]]—can be employed to optimize reactor geometry, transducer placement, and flow patterns for maximum cavitational efficiency and uniformity. The focus should be on continuous-flow systems, which offer the best potential for scale-up, with research dedicated to solving issues of channeling and ensuring consistent exposure time for all fluid elements [[6]]. Fourth, the exploration of novel materials and mechanisms offers exciting possibilities. The use of piezoelectric materials like BaTiO₃ and ZnO, which generate internal electric fields under ultrasonic vibration to split water, presents a pathway to potentially more efficient sono-catalysis [[3,12]]. The field of mechanophores—polymers designed to undergo specific chemical reactions in response to mechanical force—could be expanded to create smart materials for targeted pollutant degradation or drug delivery triggered by ultrasound [[3,12]]. Finally, expanding the application scope beyond water treatment to areas like green nanomaterial synthesis, where ultrasound enables catalyst-free reduction of metal ions [[8]], or prebiotic chemistry, where simulations suggest cavitational impacts could generate amino acids and other monomers [[3]], could open new avenues of fundamental and applied research.

In conclusion, sonochemistry stands as a powerful testament to the ability of physical energy to drive chemical transformation. From its serendipitous discovery in a sonar lab to its current status as a sophisticated branch of chemistry, the field has elucidated the extreme conditions of cavitation and harnessed them for diverse applications. Its potential for environmental remediation, particularly in degrading persistent and toxic pollutants, is undeniable. However, the stark reality is that without a concerted effort to solve the intertwined problems of energy consumption and scalability, this potential will remain largely unrealized outside of a few niche industrial applications like sludge pretreatment. The future belongs to integrated, hybrid systems designed with energy efficiency as the primary goal, supported by rigorous, reproducible science. By embracing this challenge, the field of sonochemistry can fulfill its promise as a truly sustainable and transformative technology for the 21st century.

[[3]] Sonochemistry uses sound waves, typically ultrasonic (>20 kHz), to enhance or alter chemical reactivity. Acoustic cavitation involves the generation of voids or microbubbles due to pressure drops in liquids, leading to violent collapse that releases significant energy. This process creates extreme conditions inside microbubbles with temperatures reaching several thousand Kelvin and pressures exceeding 1000 atm, as theorized by Lord Raleigh in 1917. Sonoluminescence, the emission of light during bubble collapse, has revealed plasma-like conditions within collapsing bubbles. The term "cavitational chemistry" was introduced by Cravotto and Cintas in references 9 and 10. Apfel's rules for sonochemical experiments include knowing the liquid, understanding the sound field, and recognizing when cavitation occurs. Ultrasound can be categorized into low-frequency/high-power (18-100 kHz) where mechanical effects dominate, and high-frequency/low-power (100 kHz - 10 MHz) where enhanced radical production and chemical effects are prominent. Convergent sonochemistry refers to reactions where ultrasound only accelerates the reaction without changing the product, while divergent sonochemistry produces different products compared to silent conditions. Ultrasonic irradiation at 355 kHz and 70 W produced amino acids (glycine, ethylglycine, alanine) from nitrogen, methane, water, and acetic acid at rates of 1-100 nM/min. A study by Grieser's team demonstrated formation of amino acids under similar conditions. Zeiri et al.'s computational simulations showed cavitational impacts could generate prebiotic monomers like glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, urea, cyanamide, formamide, and isocyanic acids. The use of ultrasonic power effect should not be solely associated with vibrational amplitude as it depends on the emitting surface area. Calorimetric power measurements are commonly used to estimate acoustic energy dissipation. OH radicals can be monitored using the Weissler reaction involving oxidation of aqueous KI solution to I2. DPPH decomposition serves as a sensitive probe for organic sonolysis. Spin-trapping with ESR provides accurate radical detection. Sonoluminescence spectra and chemiluminescence mapping offer spatial distribution information about acoustic energy and cavitation maxima. The sonochemical preparation of LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) takes less than 30 minutes at room temperature using diisopropylamine, lithium powder, and an electron carrier like isoprene. Ultrasound-assisted synthesis of samarium(II) iodide enables efficient reductions. Sonochemical synthesis of iron carbonyls from vinyl epoxides facilitates metal activation. Ultrasound promotes meta-selective C-H functionalization of arenes using cleaning baths at room temperature without special power control. An extensive rearrangement converts polyladderene structures into conjugated polyacetylene with semiconducting properties. Maleimide-thiol adducts stabilized through stretching via pulsed sonication at pH 7.4 accelerate adduct hydrolysis, stabilizing conjugates and reducing retro-Michael reactions. Mechanophores are covalently linked polymer chains that concentrate and propagate mechanical input to labile functional groups. Ultrasound-induced ring-opening polymerization of cyclopentasilane (Si5H10) leads to silicon nanoparticles. Piezoelectric materials such as BaTiO3 and ZnO experience acoustic vibrations causing water splitting via piezoelectric effect. BaTiO3 dendrites and ZnO fibers were shown to split water under ultrasonic vibration. Bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) microsheets combined with unspecific peroxygenase enable ultrasound-driven enzymatic C-H oxyfunctionalization. High-frequency ultrasound (800 kHz) applied to cis-cyclooctene epoxidation achieves 96% yield and 98% selectivity. Continuous flow nitration of phloroglucinol using sonication yields trinitrophloroglucinol with 98% yield. Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) generated on LiNbO3 substrates operate at frequencies up to a few GHz. Jean-Louis Luche contributed significantly to synthetic sonochemistry. The authors R.

[[5]] In 1934, Hermann Frenzel and colleagues at the University of Cologne first observed sonoluminescence when an ultrasound transducer was placed in a tank of photographic developer fluid, leading to light-emitting bubbles—a phenomenon known as multi-bubble sonoluminescence. This event marks one of the earliest experimental observations relevant to sonochemistry. The process involves acoustic cavitation, where sound waves generate bubbles that collapse violently, emitting picosecond-scale flashes of light. Sonoluminescence has since been linked to extreme conditions during bubble collapse, with relevance to chemical reactions under ultrasound. The term 'shrimpoluminescence' was coined after Versluis et al. (2001) described how snapping shrimp produce light via cavitation bubble collapse, stunning prey with shockwaves. Physicist Kirk McDonald (1998) humorously attributed all Nobel Prizes to sonoluminescence due to its role in Alfred Nobel's 1865 nitroglycerine explosion breakthrough at Dynamit Nobel A.G., where pressure wave-induced cavitation led to successful detonation.

[[13]] Ultrasound applications in environmental technology are rapidly advancing, offering eco-friendly and cost-effective solutions; ultrasonication effectively degrades various organic pollutants, particularly between frequencies of 200-540 kHz and acidic pH; cavitation phenomena during ultrasound produce extreme conditions (up to 5000 K and 1000 atm), enabling high-energy chemical reactions and free radical formation; hybrid techniques combining ultrasound with conventional methods enhance treatment efficiency for wastewater and soil remediation; ultrasound improves air purification via acoustic agglomeration; 300 kHz frequency yielded faster degradation rates than 20 kHz and 446 kHz in experiments; ultrasonic-electrochemical Fenton processes achieve up to 50% oxidation of 2,4-D herbicide in 60 seconds; studies show optimal degradation of aniline under alkaline conditions, while 4-nitrophenol degradation decreases in alkaline environments.

[[2]] Sonoluminescence (SL) is the emission of light during the collapse of a gas bubble oscillating under ultrasound, with two types: single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL) and multi-bubble sonoluminescence (MBSL). SBSL allows controlled study of cavitation with high reproducibility, where bubble collapse generates hot spots up to 15,000 K, forming a plasma emitting radiation via Bremsstrahlung, black body radiation, ion recombination, and electronic transitions. The first observation of SL was in 1934 by H. Frenzel and H. Schultes at the University of Cologne during sonar-related research, observing MBSL in an ultrasonic water bath. D. Felipe Gaitan later enabled systematic study by trapping a single sonoluminescing bubble, leading to SBSL research. Water is the optimal solvent for SL, which is 100 times brighter at 0 °C than at 40 °C, and dissolved rare gases like argon are critical, as ambient air's 1% Ar supports SL. Noble gases enhance SL intensity due to their high adiabatic ratio (γ = 1.67), with xenon yielding the highest temperatures (up to 5100 K in octanol). Rectified diffusion alters gas content in SBSL bubbles over cycles, often resulting in argon-dominated bubbles. Stable SBSL occurs only in narrow parameter ranges; e.g., at 26.5 kHz, stable SL depends on precise gas concentration and acoustic pressure. The SBSL flash duration ranges from 40–350 ps, scaling with liquid gas concentration and driving pressure. Potassium iodide (KI) dosimetry measures radical production, showing higher efficiency at 20 kHz with argon versus air, but increased radical yields at >20 kHz with air. In contaminant breakdown, halogenated compounds degrade more efficiently under argon, while non-halogenated ones favor air. For example, tannic acid degradation rate (k_air/k_argon) is 2.56, whereas alachlor is 0.33. Ultrasound frequencies used range from 20–530 kHz across studies. Comparative rate thermometry estimates bubble collapse temperatures: Suslick et al. found 5200 K in the gas phase and 1900 K extending ~270 nm into the liquid phase during Fe(CO)₅ sonolysis. Okitsu et al. observed constant bubble temperature but varying radical production under different noble gases, attributed to solubility differences affecting active bubble count. Addition reactions using 20 kHz ultrasound achieved radical formation rates up to 2.46 μmol min⁻¹ W⁻¹. Mechanical effects include polymer breakdown via shear forces and jetting near collapsing bubbles, and cleaning through streaming or cavitating jets. Medical applications exploit mechanical cavitation effects using microbubbles (<10 μm) with perfluorocarbon gas for echoscopic imaging and cell poration.

[[4]] The paper (PMID: 15952344, DOI: 10.1021/es049138y) discusses sonochemistry in environmental remediation, emphasizing that sonochemical oxidation effectively treats toxic effluents and reduces toxicity but is highly energy-intensive, limiting its industrial feasibility. To improve efficiency, hybrid systems combining ultrasound with other energy sources like UV light or chemical oxidants (H2O2, O3, Fe²⁺) are being actively researched. The study focuses on combinative and hybrid sonophotochemical oxidation processes for water pollutant treatment, indicating a key shift toward integrated advanced oxidation technologies to overcome the low energy efficiency of ultrasonic treatment alone.

[[11]] The review by Meroni et al. (2025) covers sonochemical mechanisms including cavitation bubble generation, radical formation, and parameter optimization for applications like environmental remediation. It discusses experimental and theoretical techniques for characterizing cavitation activity and reviews laboratory and large-scale sonoreactors, including batch and flow-through systems. Key challenges in scalability and sustainability of sonochemical reactors are highlighted. The article is cited by 154 publications, indicating significant scholarly impact. Authors include Daniela Meroni, Ridha Djellabi, Muthupandian Ashokkumar, Claudia L. Bianchi, and Daria C. Boffito from institutions in Italy, Australia, and Canada.

[[1]] Sonoluminescence and sonochemistry originate from thermal processes due to a localized hot-spot created by acoustic cavitation (PMID: 2203195, DOI: 10.1016/0041-624x(90)90033-k). Sonoluminescence results from chemiluminescence of thermally produced species during cavitational collapse, not electric microdischarges. Homogeneous sonochemistry behaves as high-temperature thermal reactions. Ultrasonic irradiation enhances reactivity of solid powders in slurries via shock waves causing high-velocity interparticle collisions. Brittle solids undergo shock fragmentation, increasing surface area and reactivity. Malleable metal powders experience removal of surface oxide coatings and local melting upon impact.

[[12]] Sonochemistry involves ultrasonic waves (>20 kHz) to enhance chemical reactivity through acoustic cavitation. Key pioneers include Alfred L. Loomis, Jean-Louis Luche, Ken Suslick, Tim Mason, Arnim Henglein, Peter Riesz, Takashi Ando, Oleg Abramov, and Jacques Reisse. The first observation of sonoluminescence was reported by Loomis and colleagues in 1927 using high-frequency transducers. In 1929, Schmitt et al. described ultrasonic oxidations, suggesting hydroxyl radical involvement. Richards published a comprehensive review on supersonic transformations in 1939 with 348 references. Acoustic cavitation generates extreme conditions: temperatures up to several thousand Kelvin and pressures over 1000 atm. Cavitation leads to pyrolytic decomposition, radical formation (e.g., H•, HO•), and supercritical water effects. Bubble dynamics involve nucleation, oscillation, and collapse, influencing reaction efficiency. Low-frequency ultrasound (20–100 kHz) favors mechanical effects, while high-frequency (>100 kHz) enhances radical production. Apfel’s rules emphasize knowing the liquid, sound field, and when cavitation occurs. Ultrasonic power is measured via calorimetry or chemical dosimetry (e.g., Weissler reaction). Convergent sonochemical reactions accelerate existing pathways; divergent ones yield new products. Divergent pathways include mechanochemical ring-opening of benzocyclobutene mechanophores under ultrasound, producing (E,E)-dienes contrary to thermal (E,Z) products. Ultrasound enables selective drug release from disulfide-centered polymers at 20 kHz probe with 15.84 W/cm². Piezoelectric materials like BaTiO₃ and ZnO generate strain-induced voltages enabling redox reactions without decomposition. Flow systems integrate ultrasound for continuous processing, e.g., Barton decarboxylation in Teflon coils (0.8 mm diameter, 40 m length) under 37–80 kHz. Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices use LiNbO₃ substrates operating at 20 MHz for drop-scale synthesis.

[[6]] Sonochemistry is driven by acoustic cavitation, where ultrasonic irradiation causes bubble nuclei in liquids to grow via rectified diffusion and coalescence before violently collapsing. This collapse generates extreme conditions: estimated adiabatic temperatures reach ~12,700 K for argon bubbles (γ=1.66) and ~6,150 K for water vapor (γ=1.32), with experimental measurements using metal carbonyls yielding ~5,200 K gas temperatures at 20 kHz. Key reactive species formed include H•, OH• radicals from water sonolysis (R1), and H2O2, H2 from recombination (R2-R3). In air-saturated water, complex reactions produce •HO2, NO, HNO2, and HNO3 (R5-R9). The frequency of ultrasound significantly impacts chemical effects; low-frequency US (20 kHz) produces stronger physical forces but fewer radicals, while high-frequency US (>200 kHz) maximizes radical generation, with an optimal range of 200–600 kHz for chemical effects. For environmental remediation, sonochemical treatments are classified as Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) due to their production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Water treatment is a primary application, with dual-frequency systems (one <100 kHz, one >100 kHz) showing superior degradation rates due to constructive wave interference. However, sludge disintegration is noted as a successfully scaled-up industrial application, particularly effective with low-frequency US (20-40 kHz) which matches the size of large soil flocs. Soil remediation often requires combined methods, such as ultrasound coupled with ozone or supercritical CO2 extraction. Common reactor configurations include probe (horn) systems, baths, and flow cells. Scale-up remains a major challenge due to non-uniform cavitational fields and high energy dissipation in water; continuous-flow systems are emerging as a more energy-efficient alternative to batch processing. The use of gas sparging, especially with an Ar-20% O2 mixture, significantly enhances oxidation rates.

[[15]] Acoustic cavitation is the primary mechanism in sonochemistry, involving the formation, growth, and collapse of microbubbles that generate extreme local conditions (temperatures up to 5000 K, pressures up to 1000 MPa) during implosion. These conditions lead to three key reaction zones: inside the bubble (pyrolysis), at the bubble-liquid interface (radical reactions), and in the bulk liquid (secondary reactions). The collapse produces hydroxyl (˙OH) and hydrogen (˙H) radicals via sonolysis of water, with radical generation peaking at intermediate frequencies (200–800 kHz). Three distinct mechanisms are identified: pyrolytic (thermal decomposition within bubbles), radical-based (oxidative reactions at interfaces), and supercritical water (transient formation of supercritical conditions near collapsing bubbles). Bubble dynamics—including nucleation governed by Blake threshold pressure, oscillation influenced by acoustic amplitude (0.1–several bar), and asymmetric/symmetric collapse generating microjets (up to 100 m s⁻¹) and shockwaves (up to 2000 m s⁻¹)—directly modulate reaction efficiency. Studies show paracetamol degradation reaches 65% at 165 kHz under 0.053 W mL⁻¹ calorimetric power, highlighting frequency and power dependence. Reactor types include probe (direct, high intensity), bath (indirect, lower intensity), and flow-cell systems, with cylindrical geometries enhancing reproducibility. Energy delivery efficiency varies: probes offer highest intensity (>1 W cm⁻²), followed by baths and flow cells. Key challenges include scalability due to nonlinear cavitational effects, energy inefficiency at high power inputs, and poor reproducibility from inconsistent reporting of parameters like calorimetric power. Trade-offs exist between ultrasonic power and degradation kinetics; e.g., increasing power from 0.03 to 0.10 W mL⁻¹ raises paracetamol degradation rate from <0.05 to 0.30 mg L⁻¹ min⁻¹. Heterogeneous sonocatalysis using materials like carbon nanotubes enhances pollutant removal (e.g., ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole) by combining adsorption and radical generation. Machine learning potential remains unexplored in this context.

[[7]] Sonochemistry involves the use of ultrasound (US) to induce acoustic cavitation, generating extreme conditions (5200 ± 650 K gas-phase temperature, 200 nm ambient fluid shell) that produce reactive radicals (H•, •OH, HO₂•, •O) through water activation at bubble interfaces. The process enables efficient degradation of persistent pollutants like Bisphenol A (BPA), with high-frequency ultrasound (400 kHz) showing enhanced •OH generation and degradation efficiency. US can activate oxidants such as persulfates and hydrogen peroxide, enabling eco-friendly catalytic systems without added catalysts or by-products. Key influencing factors include ultrasonic frequency, power, pH, temperature, and pollutant concentration, with frequency being the most significant due to its impact on cavitation dynamics and radical yield. The technology is primarily applied in water treatment for degrading organic pollutants, with hybrid systems (e.g., US-persulfate, US-Fenton) demonstrating synergistic effects. Common reactor configurations are not specified here, but energy efficiency and scalability remain challenges. The review highlights a knowledge gap in standardized reporting of ultrasonic parameters affecting reproducibility and emphasizes future research should focus on energy consumption and industrial feasibility rather than just removal efficiency.

[[8]] Sonochemistry involves enhancing chemical reactions in liquids via ultrasound-induced acoustic cavitation, which occurs above 16 kHz. Acoustic cavitation consists of three stages: nucleation (microbubbles form in micro-crevices), bubble growth (via rectified diffusion or inertial effects), and implosive collapse generating extreme temperatures and pressures, creating 'hot spots' for molecular fragmentation. The collapse produces hydroxyl radicals through pyrolysis: H2O + ))) → OH + H. Homogeneous sonolysis proceeds via radical intermediates, while heterogeneous systems use solid particles (e.g., Al2O3, SiO2, glass beads) to enhance cavitation by increasing nucleation sites; however, excessive solids can scatter ultrasound and reduce efficiency. Sonoluminescence (SL) results from cavitational collapse, with two types: multi-bubble (MBSL) and single-bubble (SBSL); SBSL generates higher temperatures due to more symmetric collapse. SL emits UV light (200–500 nm), with wavelengths <375 nm capable of exciting TiO2 surfaces, linking sonochemistry to photocatalytic processes. Reaction sites include the cavitation bubble (for volatile, hydrophobic compounds undergoing pyrolysis), gas-liquid interface (high OH concentration, favorable for oxidation), and bulk solution (for hydrophilic, non-volatile pollutants degraded by diffused OH radicals). Key parameters influencing sonochemical efficiency are: frequency (low: 20–100 kHz favors pyrolysis of hydrophobic compounds; medium: 300–1000 kHz enhances radical generation for hydrophilic pollutants; high: 2–10 MHz); power intensity (increases reaction rate but leads to cushion effect at high levels); saturating gas type (monatomic gases like Ar, He enhance adiabatic conditions; air promotes H2O2 and nitrogenous radical formation); temperature (higher temps reduce cavitational effects); pollutant properties (volatility and hydrophobicity determine reaction site); and addition of solids (generate liquid jets up to 400 km/h impacting surfaces, increasing reactivity). Ultrasound is widely applied in water/wastewater decontamination as an advanced oxidation process (AOP), effective against micropollutants like azo dyes, pharmaceuticals, and endocrine disruptors via pyrolysis and radical attack. It serves as both pretreatment (to improve biodegradability) and post-treatment (to remove refractory compounds). Efficiency improves with suspended solids due to enhanced cavitation, unlike UV-based methods. Combined AOPs (e.g., ultrasound with H2O2, O3, or photocatalysis) increase degradation efficiency. Disinfection requires high intensities for complete microbial kill but synergizes well with chlorination, ozonation, and electrolysis. Ultrasonic sludge pretreatment disintegrates waste activated sludge (WAS), accounting for 35–60% of wastewater treatment costs, by breaking microbial cells and releasing intracellular material, thereby improving anaerobic digestion efficiency. Hydromechanical shear forces dominate at low frequencies (<100 kHz), with Portenlänger (1999) noting disruption of macromolecules >40,000 Da; Thiem et al. (2001) found optimal WAS disintegration at lower frequencies (41–3217 kHz range). Energy input metrics include specific energy (kJ/kg TS), dose (J/L), density (W/L), and intensity (W/cm²), with disintegration degree proportional to energy input and contact time. Nanoparticle synthesis via sonochemistry yields particles ≤250 nm through metal ion reduction by H and secondary radicals (R) formed during cavitation, using organic additives (alcohols, surfactants) as stabilizers. Particle size decreases with higher stabilizer concentration and shorter alkyl chains. Monoatomic gases increase reduction rates via higher collapse temperatures. Frequency affects particle size due to standing wave patterns influencing bubble distribution. Advantages include no chemical reductants (except stabilizers), fast kinetics, and green synthesis potential. Despite promising lab-scale results in water treatment, sludge pretreatment, and nanomaterial synthesis, scalability remains limited by energy requirements, necessitating further cost-effectiveness studies for industrial deployment.

[[14]] China's sewage discharge reached 64.6 billion cubic meters by 2023. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) are highlighted for their high efficiency, fast reaction time, low secondary pollution, and wide application range in treating organic pollutants. Fenton and Fenton-like AOPs are widely studied, with domestic research showing a significant increase in publications after 2011, while foreign research has grown steadily, peaking in 2023. Core authors in China include Wang Xiaojun (9 articles), Zhang Li (5), Zhang Dewei (4), Mai Wenning (4), and Zhu Lehui (4); internationally, Daud Wan Mohd Ashri Wan, Sillanpaa Mika, Kumar P Senthil (5 each), Martinez-huitle Carlos A, and Boczkaj Grzegorz (4 each). Key institutions include South China University of Technology (16 articles), Indian Institute of Technology System (40), CNRS (40), National Institute of Technology (31), Chinese Academy of Sciences (30), and CSIR (26). High-frequency keywords in China include 'advanced treatment' (321 times), 'coking wastewater' (84), 'printing and dyeing wastewater' (56); internationally, 'advanced oxidation processes' (230), 'aqueous solution' (121), 'photocatalytic degradation' (107), and 'wastewater' (101). CiteSpace analysis revealed research trends: 2003–2009 focused on coking wastewater (burst strength 4.55); 2010–2015 on microwave (4.46); 2016–2023 on Fenton oxidation (5.42). Emerging contaminants such as PFOS, PFOA, EDCs, PPCPs, and PAHs are key concerns abroad. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), azo dyes (e.g., Orange II, methyl orange), and boron-doped diamond are recent research foci. Heterogeneous Fenton catalysis shows advantages like wider pH range, easier catalyst recovery, and less sludge, with CeO2 used as a catalyst carrier. Shokri A reported 94.5% toluene removal via electro-Fenton under optimal conditions. Photo-Fenton achieved 100% pCNB removal and 91.4% COD reduction in 30 minutes. Acid red 33 was decolorized 98.5% in 10 minutes using photo-Fenton. Spent caustic effluent showed 97% COD removal via PEF with SEC of 22.71 kWh/m³.

[[10]] Sonochemical reactors use ultrasound to generate cavitational events, enabling process intensification in physical and chemical applications. Key operating parameters include frequency, intensity, temperature, and liquid properties, while geometric factors involve reactor configuration and transducer placement. Common reactor types are not detailed here but optimization guidelines are provided for maximizing efficiency. The work highlights the potential for greener and economically beneficial processing, though scalability to commercial levels remains a challenge. Efforts from disciplines including material science, physics, chemistry, and chemical engineering are needed for large-scale implementation.
