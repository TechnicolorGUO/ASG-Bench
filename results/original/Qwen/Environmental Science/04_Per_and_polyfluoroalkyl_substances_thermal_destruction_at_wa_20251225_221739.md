## Introduction and Research Motivation

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) represent a persistent and pervasive class of environmental contaminants that have garnered significant scientific and regulatory attention. Comprising over 10,000 individual compounds, these synthetic chemicals are defined by their strong carbon-fluorine bonds, which confer extreme chemical and thermal stability [[2,10]]. The commercialization of PFAS began in the mid-20th century with DuPont's introduction of Teflon in 1946 and 3M's development of Scotchgard™ in 1953 [[2,6]]. Their widespread use in non-stick cookware, stain-resistant fabrics, firefighting foams, and numerous other industrial and consumer products has led to global contamination of soil, water, air, and wildlife [[2,6]]. The persistence of these "forever chemicals" is compounded by their bioaccumulation potential and well-documented adverse effects on human health and the environment, including links to cancer, thyroid disease, liver and kidney issues, and reproductive dysfunction [[2,10]]. This extensive contamination necessitates robust treatment strategies, particularly for high-volume sources like wastewater from water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs).

The primary motivation for this review is to provide a comprehensive and critical analysis of the state-of-the-science regarding thermal destruction technologies for PFAS, with a specific focus on their application within WRRFs. These facilities are critical nodes in the water cycle, but they also serve as concentration points for PFAS present in municipal wastewater, leading to the accumulation of these substances in sewage sludge and concentrated brines. While many treatment methods exist, achieving complete mineralization—the ultimate goal for eliminating PFAS—remains a formidable challenge. Thermal processes, which utilize high temperatures to break down complex organic molecules, are among the most promising candidates for this task. However, their implementation is fraught with technical, economic, and operational complexities.

This review synthesizes findings from recent literature to address several key questions. What are the fundamental principles governing the thermal degradation of different classes of PFAS? How do various thermal technologies compare in terms of performance, energy consumption, and byproduct formation? What are the real-world applications and limitations of these technologies, particularly within the unique context of WRRFs? And crucially, what are the remaining knowledge gaps and research priorities needed to move these technologies from laboratory concepts to reliable, scalable solutions for managing PFAS-contaminated waste streams? By systematically examining the evidence, this paper aims to clarify the current landscape, highlight the trade-offs inherent in each approach, and chart a course for future research and development efforts.

## Key Concepts and Fundamental Principles of PFAS Destruction

Understanding the thermal destruction of PFAS requires a foundational knowledge of the chemical properties that make them both useful and problematic, as well as an appreciation for the mechanisms through which they can be broken down. The defining characteristic of PFAS is the carbon-fluorine (C-F) bond, one of the strongest single bonds in organic chemistry, with a bond dissociation energy of approximately 488 kJ/mol [[2]]. This intrinsic strength is the primary reason for their environmental persistence and resistance to conventional degradation pathways. The PFAS family is broadly categorized based on chain length into long-chain (LC-PFAS), typically containing eight or more carbon atoms (e.g., perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS)), and short-chain (SC-PFAS), which have fewer than eight carbons [[2]]. While LC-PFAS have historically received more regulatory scrutiny due to their greater bioaccumulation potential, emerging evidence suggests SC-PFAS are also highly persistent and pose significant risks, making their destruction equally critical [[2]].

The thermal destruction of PFAS involves breaking these resilient C-F bonds, a process that can lead to two primary outcomes: defluorination and mineralization. Defluorination refers to the removal of fluorine atoms from the organic molecule, often resulting in shorter-chain PFAS or fluoride ions (F⁻). Mineralization is the more desirable outcome, representing the complete breakdown of the organic structure into its elemental components: carbon dioxide (CO₂), water (H₂O), and inorganic acids such as hydrofluoric acid (HF) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) if sulfur-containing groups are present [[5,8]]. Achieving high levels of mineralization is essential for ensuring the final effluent is non-toxic. The efficiency of these processes is influenced by several key factors. Temperature is the most critical parameter; higher temperatures generally accelerate bond-breaking reactions. However, the required temperature varies significantly depending on the PFAS compound. For instance, studies show that ≥600 °C is necessary for the destruction of PFSAs, while perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) can be degraded at lower temperatures of ≥450 °C [[5]]. Oxygen availability is another crucial factor. Incomplete combustion in low-oxygen environments can lead to the formation of toxic byproducts, including dioxins and novel, uncharacterized PFAS compounds [[14]]. Conversely, sufficient oxygen is required for mineralization to occur.

The choice of oxidant also plays a significant role, especially in advanced oxidation processes like Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO). While dissolved oxygen is a common oxidant, others like hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) have been shown to provide equivalent or even superior destruction compared to oxygen alone [[5]]. Furthermore, the presence of co-contaminants in the waste stream can impact process efficiency. Some technologies, such as plasma and sonolysis, appear to be relatively resilient to co-contaminants, whereas electrochemical oxidation can suffer reduced reaction kinetics in complex matrices [[12]]. Finally, the physical phase transition of the PFAS compound itself can become a rate-limiting step. Research using electromagnetic induction heating demonstrated that the evaporation of PFAS from a solid or liquid matrix can be slower than the subsequent gas-phase degradation, highlighting the importance of rapid heating to allow for effective degradation of the melted compound before it evaporates [[3]]. Understanding these interdependent variables is paramount for designing and optimizing thermal treatment systems for PFAS.

## Historical Development and Technological Milestones

The history of PFAS is intertwined with decades of industrial innovation, followed by a growing awareness of their environmental and health impacts, which has driven the development of increasingly sophisticated destruction technologies. The story begins in the mid-20th century with the accidental discovery of fluorinated polymers' stain-resistant properties by 3M chemist Patsy O’Connell Sherman in 1953 [[2]]. This led to the creation of Scotchgard™, whose active ingredient was later identified as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) [[2]]. Around the same time, DuPont was developing Teflon, a polymer based on PFOA, which was first synthesized by Roy J. Plunkett in 1938 [[6]]. The U.S. military soon recognized the utility of PFAS in creating aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) for fighting petroleum fires, with the U.S. Navy and 3M collaborating on its development in the 1960s [[6]]. This technology became standard practice at military bases, airports, and firefighter training centers globally throughout the 1970s, establishing a major pathway for PFAS release into the environment [[6]].

As the scale of PFAS use expanded, so did the understanding of its consequences. Regulatory action began slowly but gained momentum over the decades. In 2006, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initiated the PFOA Stewardship Program, persuading major companies to eliminate PFOA and related compounds from their products and emissions by 2015 [[6]]. In 2009, the EPA established the first drinking water health advisories, setting limits at 200 ppt for PFOS and 400 ppt for PFOA [[6]]. The advisory level for the combined concentrations of PFOA and PFOS was lowered to 70 ppt in 2016, signaling a tightening of standards [[6]]. More recently, the European Union has set legally binding limits, establishing a maximum of 100 ng/L for the sum of 20 different PFAS in drinking water in 2019 [[9]]. In the United States, the EPA released its 'PFAS Strategic Roadmap' in 2021, outlining a multi-year plan for research, regulation, and remediation, and has mandated reporting for 179 PFAS chemicals under the Toxics Release Inventory [[6]].

This evolving regulatory pressure, coupled with massive legal liabilities stemming from lawsuits against manufacturers like 3M, DuPont, and Chemours, has created a powerful impetus for technological advancement [[10]]. The historical development of destruction technologies reflects this progression. Initially, simple incineration was used as a method for disposing of hazardous waste containing PFAS. However, its efficacy and safety were never fully proven, leading to the U.S. Department of Defense banning the incineration of PFAS-laden materials under the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act [[4,12]]. This ban underscored a critical gap in the available toolkit and spurred investment in alternative technologies. Today, the field is characterized by a diverse portfolio of advanced thermal and non-thermal methods. The emergence of Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO) providers like Battelle, Aquarden Technologies, and 374Water represents a significant milestone, offering a potentially safer and more efficient alternative for treating high-concentration PFAS waste streams [[10,11]]. Similarly, innovative approaches like Hydrothermal Alkaline Treatment (HALT) and advanced electrochemical oxidation are gaining traction [[7,10]]. The table below summarizes key milestones in the history of PFAS regulation and technology.

## Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Performance Analysis

The current landscape of thermal destruction technologies for PFAS is varied, encompassing both mature and emerging methods, each with distinct operating principles, performance metrics, and suitability for different waste streams. While no single solution is universally applicable, significant progress has been made in demonstrating the viability of several advanced thermal and electrochemical processes. A comparative analysis reveals a clear trend towards technologies that offer higher destruction efficiencies, better control over byproducts, and the potential for scalability, though often at the cost of increased complexity and energy demand.

Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO) stands out as one of the most promising and rigorously tested technologies, particularly for aqueous waste streams. It operates by heating an aqueous solution containing PFAS above the critical point of water (374°C at 218-221 bar), placing it in a supercritical state where it exhibits properties of both a liquid and a gas [[4,5]]. In this state, a powerful oxidant, typically dissolved oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, is introduced, leading to rapid mineralization of the organic matter [[5,7]]. Pilot-scale demonstrations by leading providers such as Battelle, Aquarden Technologies, and 374Water have consistently reported destruction efficiencies exceeding 99% [[4,11,12]]. For example, the Battelle PFAS Annihilator™ system achieved a continuous 5-log reduction (99.999%) at temperatures of ≥600°C and pressures of ≥3500 psi, reducing inlet concentrations of up to 50 ppm to effluent levels below 70 ppt [[5]]. Similarly, a demonstration by Aquarden Technologies showed >99% degradation of PFOS in AFFF from 26.2 mg/L to 240 μg/L [[11]]. However, these impressive results come with significant caveats. Field tests have revealed that despite high destruction rates, effluent concentrations can still exceed the stringent USEPA health advisories, suggesting the formation of unmeasured organofluorine compounds or the need for post-treatment polishing [[4,11]]. Furthermore, the process generates highly corrosive acids like HF and H₂SO₄, necessitating expensive reactor construction with high-grade alloys and posing challenges with salt precipitation [[5,8,12]].

Thermal Incineration remains the only commercially established method for the complete destruction of PFAS in solid wastes, such as sewage sludge [[9]]. Municipal sewage sludge incinerators (SSIs) operate at high temperatures, typically between 980–1200°C, and are designed to handle large volumes of material [[4,9]]. Laboratory studies suggest these conditions can achieve over 99% degradation of target compounds like PFOS [[9]]. However, the real-world effectiveness of incineration is clouded by uncertainty regarding the fate of all PFAS species during the process. Evidence from waste-to-energy plants indicates that not all PFAS are destroyed; some are emitted via flue gas, ash, and treated process water, with short-chain PFCAs like PFHxA being particularly prevalent in emissions [[9,16]]. The U.S. Department of Defense's ban on incinerating PFAS-laden materials highlights these concerns about incomplete destruction and potential atmospheric releases [[4,12]]. Other emerging thermal methods include plasma arc technology, pyrolysis, and hydrothermal alkaline treatment (HALT). Plasma reactors can achieve high removal efficiencies (>90% for long-chain PFAS) but are limited by very high energy consumption [[7,8]]. Pyrolysis is still largely in the developmental phase, with pilot-scale studies showing promise, especially when combined with additives like lime or calcium oxide to promote mineralization [[1,15]]. HALT offers a compelling alternative, operating at lower temperatures (~350°C) under alkaline subcritical water conditions, effectively degrading both long- and short-chain PFAS without generating toxic byproducts [[7,10]].

The table below provides a comparative overview of the state-of-the-art thermal and selected non-thermal technologies discussed in the provided literature.

## Applications and Case Studies in Water Resource Recovery Contexts

The application of thermal destruction technologies for PFAS is primarily driven by the need to manage contaminated waste streams generated at Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs). These facilities produce two main types of residuals that pose significant PFAS management challenges: biosolids (sludge) and concentrate from water treatment processes, such as reverse osmosis brine. While thermal treatment is a central strategy, its implementation faces unique hurdles within the WRRF environment, including high moisture content, the presence of complex organic and inorganic matrices, and the sheer volume of material. The case studies and applications described in the literature reflect a focus on high-concentration, problematic waste streams, such as those generated by the defense sector and manufacturing industries, which are often sent to specialized treatment facilities rather than directly managed at municipal WRRFs.

For sewage sludge, the most mature thermal option is incineration, which is practiced at over 100 facilities in North America [[9]]. However, as previously noted, the effectiveness of these units in completely destroying all PFAS and preventing their release into the environment is a major concern [[9,16]]. The data from a Swedish waste-to-energy plant provides a stark example of this challenge. During the incineration of municipal solid waste with a small addition of sewage sludge (5–8 wt%), researchers detected the emission of several PFAS compounds via the flue gas for the first time, including PFOA, PFHpA, and PFBS [[16]]. This finding underscores the reality that even high-temperature incineration is not a fail-safe solution and that ongoing monitoring and potentially additional treatment steps are necessary. Emerging thermal methods like pyrolysis and hydrothermal treatment are being investigated as alternatives for sludge, with the potential to convert waste into valuable products like bio-oil or syngas while simultaneously destroying PFAS [[1,15]]. However, these technologies are still largely in the pilot-scale stage and require further development to prove their feasibility for the large-scale, wet, and variable nature of sewage sludge [[9]].

More frequently documented are the applications of advanced thermal technologies to highly concentrated aqueous wastes, such as Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (AFFF), a primary source of legacy PFAS contamination at military sites. These cases provide clearer evidence of the capabilities of technologies like SCWO. Three separate pilot-scale demonstrations conducted by Battelle, Aquarden Technologies, and 374Water showcased the power of SCWO in treating AFFF-contaminated water [[11]]. The results, summarized in the table below, demonstrate near-complete destruction of both PFOA and PFOS, often reducing concentrations from tens or hundreds of milligrams per liter down to parts-per-billion or non-detect levels.

| Provider | Inlet Concentration (PFOS) | Effluent Concentration (PFOS) | Inlet Concentration (PFOA) | Effluent Concentration (PFOA) | Reactor Conditions | Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Aquarden Tech** | 26.2 mg/L | 240 µg/L | 930 µg/L | 0.14 µg/L | 590 °C, 24 MPa, 6 s residence time | `[[11]]` |
| **Battelle** | 30.4 mg/L | 0.310 µg/L | 883 µg/L | 0.102 µg/L | ≥600 °C, ≥238 atm, 11.4 L/h flow rate | `[[11]]` |
| **374Water** | 190 mg/L | 8.57 µg/L | 3,100 µg/L | Non-detect | 595 °C, 24 MPa, 60 s residence time | `[[11]]` |

These case studies are pivotal because they provide quantitative proof-of-concept for the destruction of PFAS in a form that is more amenable to thermal treatment than the complex sludge matrix. They demonstrate that when operated correctly, SCWO can meet extremely stringent discharge limits. However, these successes must be weighed against the known challenges of the technology, such as the need for expensive corrosion-resistant materials and the potential for the effluent to still contain measurable fluoride, requiring further polishing [[5,11]]. The application of these technologies at WRRFs will likely involve a hybrid approach, where high-concentration AFFF-contaminated water from fire-training areas is treated off-site using SCWO or a similar technology, while the sludge undergoes incineration or another thermal process, with strict controls and monitoring to manage the inevitable emissions. The development of integrated systems, such as combining ion-exchange resins with electrochemical oxidation (IXR-EO), is also aimed at pre-concentrating PFAS from dilute streams to make them viable for thermal treatment [[7]].

## Critical Analysis of Challenges and Open Problems

Despite significant advancements, the thermal destruction of PFAS is beset by a host of interconnected challenges and open problems that hinder widespread adoption and raise critical questions about their ultimate safety and efficacy. A critical analysis reveals that the path to reliable, scalable solutions is paved with technical, economic, environmental, and regulatory obstacles. One of the most fundamental and widely acknowledged challenges is the issue of incomplete destruction and the formation of toxic byproducts. Even with technologies like SCWO that report high destruction efficiencies, the final effluent has been shown to exceed stringent U.S. EPA health advisories, suggesting that a fraction of the total organofluorine mass is converted into other, as-yet-unidentified PFAS compounds [[4,11]]. This phenomenon was confirmed in a Battelle study where only 27% of the generated fluoride could be accounted for by the targeted PFAS, implying the presence of other organofluorine compounds that were also destroyed [[11]]. This creates a dangerous ambiguity: a process might claim to destroy 99.9% of a measured contaminant while simultaneously creating thousands of other unknown, potentially harmful PFAS.

This problem is compounded by the severe operational challenges associated with many of these technologies. Supercritical Water Oxidation, for instance, operates in an extremely harsh environment, generating highly corrosive acids like hydrofluoric and sulfuric acid that attack conventional reactor materials [[5,8]]. This necessitates the use of expensive high-nickel alloys, significantly increasing capital and maintenance costs. Alongside corrosion, salt precipitation is a major operational bottleneck, as the fluoride produced during defluorination can react with other salts in the feedwater to form hard, adherent deposits that foul heat exchangers and block pipes, leading to frequent shutdowns for cleaning [[5,12]]. High energy consumption is another universal challenge. The energy required to heat water to its supercritical state for SCWO is immense, estimated at 1.1 × 10⁵ kW·h per kilogram of PFAS destroyed, with some figures reaching as high as 1.5 × 10⁶ kWh/kg [[7,12]]. Plasma arc technology presents an even starker picture, with specific energy consumption cited in the range of 390–2370 kWh/m³, making it economically prohibitive for most applications [[8,12]]. These high energy demands not only drive up operating costs but also cast doubt on the net environmental benefit of the process, especially if the energy is sourced from fossil fuels.

Furthermore, there are significant analytical and regulatory hurdles. The vast number of PFAS chemicals—with estimates ranging from 4,000 to over 10,000—presents a monumental challenge for monitoring and regulation [[2,10]]. Currently, analytical methods can only measure a fraction of these compounds, meaning regulators and operators are essentially managing a problem for which they cannot see the full scope [[9]]. This lack of comprehensive standards means that even if a treatment process meets a specified limit for a few regulated compounds, the presence of other unregulated PFAS in the effluent remains a risk. Finally, the question of emissions remains unresolved, particularly for incineration. While the U.S. Department of Defense has banned the practice for certain materials, the debate continues over its use for other wastes [[4,12]]. Evidence from waste-to-energy plants shows that incineration can lead to the release of short-chain PFAS via flue gas, contributing to atmospheric pollution and creating a new pathway for environmental contamination [[16]]. The potential for catalytic reactions in the cool-down regions of incinerators to form novel PFAS is a serious concern that warrants further investigation [[14]]. These cumulative challenges—from incomplete destruction and operational fragility to high costs and uncertain emissions—paint a complex picture and underscore the fact that no single thermal technology is a silver bullet for the PFAS problem.

## Future Research Directions and Synthesis of Key Findings

In conclusion, the thermal destruction of PFAS at Water Resource Recovery Facilities represents a critical and rapidly evolving frontier in environmental engineering. This review has synthesized the current state-of-the-science, revealing a field characterized by both significant promise and profound challenges. The journey from early industrial applications to today's sophisticated destruction technologies has been driven by mounting evidence of the health and environmental risks posed by these ubiquitous contaminants. The analysis clearly demonstrates that while thermal methods, particularly Supercritical Water Oxidation, can achieve remarkable destruction efficiencies for targeted PFAS, they are far from a perfect solution. The overarching theme that emerges is one of trade-offs: the highest efficiencies come with the greatest operational and financial burdens, and the most mature technologies carry unresolved risks of incomplete destruction and unintended emissions.

To advance the field and translate these promising laboratory and pilot-scale results into reliable, scalable, and safe solutions, several key research directions must be pursued. First and foremost, there is an urgent need for fundamental mechanistic studies to understand the precise pathways of PFAS degradation and the formation of novel byproducts. This includes developing analytical methods capable of characterizing the wide array of unmeasured organofluorine compounds that persist after treatment. Without this knowledge, it is impossible to conduct a truly comprehensive risk assessment of any given technology. Second, research must focus on improving the durability and cost-effectiveness of materials and systems. Developing more affordable, corrosion-resistant materials for SCWO reactors and devising robust anti-scaling strategies are essential for reducing capital and operational costs. Third, there is a critical need for field-scale validation and long-term operational studies. Most of the high-profile successes have been from short-duration pilot tests. Real-world performance in the presence of complex, fluctuating waste streams, as found at WRRFs, must be thoroughly investigated to build confidence in the technology's reliability.

Finally, the integration of thermal treatment into a broader waste management framework is a crucial area for future work. Research should explore hybrid systems that combine thermal processes with other technologies, such as advanced separation and concentration methods, to optimize the destruction of PFAS across different waste streams. For example, integrating thermal treatment with ion-exchange resin-electrochemical oxidation (IXR-EO) or other polishing steps could create a more holistic and effective treatment train [[7]]. In summary, while thermal destruction offers a powerful tool for tackling the PFAS crisis, its successful deployment hinges on solving the critical challenges of incomplete destruction, high cost, and operational fragility. The path forward requires a concerted effort focused on deepening our mechanistic understanding, enhancing the robustness of the technologies themselves, and validating their performance in the complex and demanding environments of modern water resource recovery facilities.
