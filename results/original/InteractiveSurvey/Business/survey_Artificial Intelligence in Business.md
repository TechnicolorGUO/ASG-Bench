## 5.3 Comparative and Benchmarking Studies in AI

### 5.3.1 Model Family Comparisons and Task Taxonomy
Model family comparisons and task taxonomy serve as a foundational framework for understanding the diverse capabilities and design choices of large language models (LLMs). This section systematically evaluates different model families, such as autoregressive, encoder-decoder, and hybrid architectures, by analyzing their strengths and limitations across a range of tasks. By categorizing tasks into distinct types—such as generation, reasoning, and comprehension—this analysis provides a structured way to assess model performance and suitability for specific applications. The taxonomy also highlights how different model designs align with varying task requirements, enabling a more informed selection of models for particular use cases.

The task taxonomy is further refined by considering the contextual and disciplinary nuances of real-world applications. For instance, tasks in scientific research, legal analysis, and business strategy require distinct modeling approaches and evaluation criteria. This section explores how model families adapt to these varying demands, emphasizing the importance of aligning model capabilities with task-specific constraints. By mapping tasks onto a unified input–output framework, the taxonomy ensures consistency in model development and benchmarking, while also preserving disciplinary relevance. This structured approach facilitates comparative analysis and supports the identification of gaps in current model capabilities.

Finally, the section synthesizes insights from model family comparisons and task taxonomy to guide practical decision-making. It outlines the core task types, representative benchmarks, and commonly used methods, offering a comprehensive overview of the current LLM landscape. This synthesis not only aids in selecting appropriate models and tools but also provides a common vocabulary for discussing model performance and application potential. By bridging the gap between theoretical model capabilities and practical task requirements, this section equips readers with the knowledge needed to make methodologically sound choices in model deployment and evaluation.

### 5.3.2 Interdisciplinary Integration and AI Evaluation
Interdisciplinary integration in AI evaluation involves aligning domain-specific research tasks with computational frameworks to ensure both disciplinary relevance and algorithmic consistency. By developing a taxonomy that maps traditional disciplinary methodologies onto a unified input–output structure, this approach enables systematic model development, benchmarking, and comparative analysis across diverse fields [19]. This integration not only supports the adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to specific academic and professional contexts but also facilitates the identification of problem formulations that can benefit from AI assistance. Such a structured approach enhances the reproducibility and generalizability of AI-driven solutions while maintaining the integrity of domain-specific knowledge.

The evaluation of AI systems within interdisciplinary contexts requires a nuanced understanding of the unique challenges and standards of each discipline. For instance, in the arts, letters, and law, the focus may be on interpretive and ethical dimensions, whereas in science and engineering, the emphasis is on accuracy, reliability, and performance metrics. This necessitates the design of evaluation frameworks that are both flexible and robust, capable of capturing the multifaceted impacts of AI across different domains. By integrating disciplinary insights into AI evaluation, researchers can better anticipate failure modes, estimate potential impacts, and ensure that AI applications are aligned with the values and objectives of their respective fields [19].

Moreover, the continuous evolution of AI technologies demands ongoing refinement of interdisciplinary evaluation practices. As AI systems become more sophisticated, their integration into various disciplines will require adaptive evaluation strategies that account for emerging trends, ethical considerations, and practical constraints. This includes the development of benchmarks that reflect real-world applications and the incorporation of domain-specific feedback into model training and validation processes. Ultimately, effective interdisciplinary integration and AI evaluation will be critical in realizing the transformative potential of AI while ensuring its responsible and impactful deployment across diverse sectors.
