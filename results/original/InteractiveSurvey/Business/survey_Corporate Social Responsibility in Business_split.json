This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where the original problem contains higher-order interactions, such as in polynomial unconstrained binary optimization (PUBO) problems [3]. By introducing additional variables, quadratization techniques convert these higher-order terms into pairwise interactions, effectively reducing the problem to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form [3]. However, this transformation often increases the search space and introduces discrepancies between the original and transformed cost functions, which can affect the accuracy of the solution.\n\nDespite these challenges, quadratization remains a critical tool in optimization, especially for problems that are inherently non-convex or involve complex interactions. The reformulation process allows for the application of well-established quadratic optimization techniques, which are more computationally feasible and widely supported in existing solvers. However, the effectiveness of these methods depends heavily on the choice of quadratization strategy, as different approaches can lead to varying levels of complexity and accuracy [3]. Moreover, the introduction of auxiliary variables can complicate the interpretation of results and may require additional constraints to maintain the integrity of the original problem.\n\nRecent advancements in quadratization techniques have aimed to address these limitations by minimizing the number of additional variables and preserving the structural properties of the original problem. These efforts include the development of more efficient reformulation strategies that maintain a closer alignment between the original and transformed cost functions. Additionally, research has focused on integrating quadratization with other optimization methods, such as heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms, to enhance performance while maintaining computational efficiency. These developments highlight the ongoing importance of quadratization in enabling higher-order optimization for a wide range of applications."

Unlike traditional supervised learning, RL enables agents to learn optimal policies through interaction with an environment, balancing exploration and exploitation to maximize cumulative rewards [4]. This capability is especially critical in domains with dynamic and uncertain conditions, such as autonomous systems, resource management, and multi-agent coordination. The application of RL in these contexts involves modeling the environment as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the agent learns to make decisions that account for long-term consequences, often leveraging function approximation techniques to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces.\n\nRecent advancements in RL have focused on enhancing scalability and adaptability in complex decision-making. Techniques such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) integrate neural networks with traditional RL frameworks, allowing agents to learn representations from raw data and generalize across diverse scenarios. This integration has enabled breakthroughs in areas like robotics, game playing, and autonomous control, where the interplay of multiple variables demands sophisticated decision strategies. Additionally, methods like policy gradient algorithms, actor-critic frameworks, and model-based RL have been developed to improve sample efficiency and stability, addressing challenges such as sparse rewards and delayed feedback. These innovations have expanded the applicability of RL to real-world problems that require robust and flexible decision-making under uncertainty.\n\nDespite its successes, RL for complex decision-making remains an active area of research, with ongoing challenges in generalization, safety, and interpretability. The need for efficient exploration strategies, handling of partial observability, and ensuring alignment with human values are critical considerations. Furthermore, the integration of RL with other AI paradigms, such as planning and knowledge-based systems, is essential for tackling multi-faceted problems.

Multi-agent systems (MAS) enable complex tasks to be decomposed into subtasks that can be managed by individual agents, which then collaborate through communication, coordination, and negotiation. This paradigm is especially relevant in applications such as autonomous driving, disaster response, and scientific discovery, where the interplay of multiple agents can significantly enhance system performance and robustness. The design of such systems involves addressing challenges related to agent autonomy, decision-making under uncertainty, and the management of interactions across heterogeneous agents.\n\nThe modeling of multi-agent systems typically involves formalisms such as agent architectures, communication protocols, and coordination mechanisms. These models must account for both the individual capabilities of agents and the emergent properties that arise from their interactions. In particular, the integration of large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent frameworks has introduced new dimensions, allowing agents to engage in natural language-based reasoning and decision-making [5]. This has enabled more flexible and context-aware interactions, where agents can dynamically adjust their strategies based on verbal or textual inputs.
