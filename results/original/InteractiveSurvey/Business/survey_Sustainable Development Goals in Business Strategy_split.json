This alignment enables more accurate modeling of relationships, particularly for graphs with hierarchical or relational complexity, where the curvature of the embedding space can reflect the natural structure of the data. Recent advances have demonstrated that such geometrically informed embeddings significantly improve performance on tasks like link prediction and entity classification [4].\n\nGeometric control in KGE involves the integration of explicit geometric constraints during the embedding process, allowing for more precise and interpretable representations. This approach goes beyond mere geometric space selection by incorporating curvature-aware optimization strategies that dynamically adjust to the local structure of the graph. Techniques such as Riemannian optimization and manifold learning are employed to ensure that the embedding space respects the intrinsic curvature of the knowledge graph [4]. These methods enable the preservation of semantic and relational information while mitigating the distortions that arise from rigid, flat-space embeddings. By explicitly modeling the geometric properties of the graph, curvature-aware KGE not only enhances the quality of the embeddings but also provides a more robust foundation for downstream tasks that rely on accurate relational reasoning.\n\nThe integration of geometric control in KGE has led to the development of novel frameworks that combine deep learning with manifold-based representations, allowing for scalable and interpretable models.
