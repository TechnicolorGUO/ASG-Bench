      "level": 3,
      "content": "Benchmarking XAI techniques is essential to evaluate their effectiveness in enhancing model transparency and supporting human decision-making [12]. However, the current landscape of XAI methods lacks a standardized framework for comparison, leading to fragmented assessments that often prioritize technical performance over user-centric outcomes [5]. This section addresses the need for systematic benchmarking by analyzing existing evaluation metrics and highlighting gaps in their applicability across diverse domains. Without a unified set of criteria, it becomes challenging to determine which XAI methods are most suitable for specific tasks, particularly in high-stakes applications where interpretability and trust are paramount [13].\n\nA unified set of criteria for XAI evaluation must balance technical rigor with practical usability, ensuring that explanations are both accurate and comprehensible to end-users [5]. This involves considering factors such as fidelity, stability, and user satisfaction, while also accounting for the context in which explanations are used. Current benchmarks often focus on model-level metrics, such as feature importance or model-agnostic interpretability, but fail to capture the nuanced interaction between explanations and human users. Developing a holistic evaluation framework requires integrating domain-specific requirements and user feedback mechanisms to ensure that XAI techniques meet real-world needs and enhance decision-making processes effectively [2].\n\nThe absence of a common benchmarking standard hinders the progress of XAI research and limits its adoption in critical applications [14]. To address this, the section proposes a structured approach for evaluating XAI techniques, emphasizing the importance of reproducibility, scalability, and adaptability [2]. By establishing a shared set of evaluation protocols, researchers can more effectively compare methods, identify strengths and weaknesses, and drive innovation toward more transparent and user-friendly AI systems. This unified perspective is crucial for advancing XAI from theoretical exploration to practical implementation, ensuring that explanations serve both technical and societal objectives [7]."

At the same time, stakeholders such as legal and regulatory bodies demand transparency and accountability to ensure compliance with evolving laws. This necessitates a balance between technical performance and interpretability, ensuring that explanations are both accurate and meaningful to non-expert audiences. The integration of stakeholder feedback into XAI design is crucial for fostering trust and ensuring that systems are aligned with real-world application contexts [14].\n\nLegal compliance in XAI is increasingly critical as regulatory frameworks evolve to address the societal and ethical implications of AI [15]. Laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandate that automated decisions be explainable, placing a legal obligation on organizations to implement XAI mechanisms [16]. This compliance requirement drives the development of XAI systems that not only provide transparency but also meet specific legal standards [14]. However, the dynamic nature of regulations poses challenges, as XAI solutions must remain adaptable to changing legal landscapes. Ensuring that explanations are legally robust while maintaining technical accuracy is a key challenge for researchers and practitioners alike.\n\nThe interaction between XAI and legal compliance also raises broader ethical considerations, particularly regarding the potential for misuse or manipulation of explanations. Stakeholders, including policymakers and industry leaders, must collaborate to establish guidelines that promote fairness, accountability, and transparency. This includes addressing issues such as bias in explanations and ensuring that XAI systems do not inadvertently reinforce existing inequalities. By embedding legal and ethical considerations into the design and deployment of XAI, stakeholders can help create AI systems that are not only technically sound but also socially responsible and legally compliant [14]."

These requirements often involve mandating that AI systems provide clear, interpretable justifications for their decisions, which in turn influences the design and evaluation of XAI techniques [8]. Compliance with these standards not only supports legal adherence but also enhances the societal acceptance of AI technologies.\n\nEthically, XAI systems must balance transparency with privacy and security, ensuring that explanations do not inadvertently expose sensitive information or create new vulnerabilities [16]. Additionally, the design of XAI must consider the potential for misuse, such as when explanations are manipulated to mislead users or obscure algorithmic biases [18]. There is also a growing concern about the equitable distribution of XAI benefits, as the development and deployment of these systems may disproportionately favor certain groups or industries. Ethical frameworks must address these challenges by promoting fairness, inclusivity, and the protection of individual rights. This requires interdisciplinary collaboration among technologists, ethicists, and policymakers to develop guidelines that are both technically sound and socially responsible.\n\nThe evolving landscape of XAI regulation and ethics demands continuous adaptation to emerging technologies and societal expectations [14]. As XAI systems are applied in increasingly complex and diverse contexts, the need for robust evaluation metrics that capture both technical and ethical dimensions becomes more pressing [14]. These metrics should ensure that XAI systems are not only accurate and interpretable but also aligned with human values and legal requirements [14]. Furthermore, the development of standardized evaluation protocols will help in assessing the effectiveness of XAI in real-world scenarios, fostering trust and enabling broader adoption [2]. Ultimately, addressing these regulatory and ethical challenges is essential to realizing the full potential of XAI in a manner that is both beneficial and just [16]."

Unlike technical users who may have expertise in model development, end-users often lack the background to interpret complex algorithmic decisions, making it essential to tailor XAI solutions to their cognitive and contextual needs [5]. Usability in XAI involves not only the clarity of explanations but also their relevance, accessibility, and the ability to support informed decision-making [19]. This necessitates a user-centered design approach that considers the diverse backgrounds, goals, and limitations of end-users across different domains.\n\nA major challenge in addressing end-user requirements lies in the gap between technical capabilities of XAI methods and the practical needs of non-expert users [5]. Many XAI techniques focus on model-level transparency or algorithmic interpretability, often neglecting the human factors that influence how explanations are perceived and utilized [11]. For instance, an explanation may be technically accurate but fail to communicate its significance in a way that aligns with the user’s understanding or task context. This mismatch can lead to misinterpretation, reduced trust, or even overreliance on AI, undermining the intended benefits of XAI. Therefore, usability in XAI must be evaluated through empirical studies that assess how end-users interact with and comprehend explanations in real-world settings [19].\n\nTo enhance usability, XAI systems must be designed with adaptive interfaces that accommodate varying levels of user expertise and task complexity. This includes providing customizable explanation formats, interactive visualization tools, and feedback mechanisms that allow users to refine their understanding. Additionally, usability should be evaluated using metrics that go beyond technical performance, incorporating user satisfaction, decision accuracy, and the ability to detect errors or biases. By prioritizing end-user needs, XAI can transition from a technical aspiration to a practical tool that empowers users to engage more effectively with AI systems, fostering trust and accountability in critical decision-making scenarios [19]."

Empirical studies highlight that the effectiveness of XAI is not solely determined by the technical quality of explanations but also by how users perceive, interpret, and act upon them [11]. Factors such as cognitive load, prior knowledge, and trust in AI significantly influence the way individuals process explanations, often leading to varied levels of reliance on AI recommendations [8]. This interplay between human cognition and XAI mechanisms underscores the need for user-centered design in explanation systems to ensure that they align with human expectations and decision-making processes [19].\n\nResearch in this area reveals that XAI can both enhance and hinder human-AI collaboration, depending on the context and the nature of the explanations provided [18]. For instance, overly complex or ambiguous explanations may overwhelm users, reducing their confidence in the system, while overly simplified explanations may lead to overreliance on AI without critical evaluation. Additionally, psychological biases such as confirmation bias and overconfidence can distort users' interpretation of AI outputs, further complicating the decision-making process. These findings emphasize the importance of tailoring XAI systems to specific user profiles and task requirements to optimize their impact on human performance and trust.\n\nThe study of human behavior in XAI contexts also raises critical questions about the design of adaptive and interactive explanation interfaces [19]. Effective XAI should not only provide transparency but also support users in making informed decisions by aligning with their cognitive and contextual needs [20]. This requires a deeper understanding of how different user groups, such as experts versus laypersons, engage with AI explanations [8]. By integrating insights from psychology, human-computer interaction, and AI, future research can develop more intuitive and effective XAI systems that enhance, rather than impede, human decision-making in high-stakes environments [19]."

      "content": "Compositional and modular interpretability in XAI refers to the ability of models to decompose complex decision-making processes into interpretable components, enabling a structured understanding of how individual features or sub-models contribute to the final output [4]. This approach emphasizes the design of models that inherently incorporate transparency through their architecture, allowing for the isolation and analysis of specific elements without compromising performance. By structuring models into modular units, each responsible for a distinct aspect of the decision process, researchers can enhance both the explainability and the robustness of AI systems. This methodology is particularly valuable in high-stakes applications where the reliability and accountability of AI decisions are paramount.\n\nModular interpretability further supports the development of interpretable models by enabling the integration of domain-specific knowledge into the model's design. This allows for the creation of systems where each module can be independently validated, tested, and refined, thereby improving the overall trustworthiness of the AI system. Compositional techniques often leverage hierarchical or component-based structures, where each layer or module contributes to the final decision in a manner that can be traced and understood. This not only facilitates debugging and model refinement but also supports the creation of more transparent and human-comprehensible AI systems, which are essential for fostering user trust and ensuring ethical deployment.\n\nThe interplay between compositional and modular interpretability underscores the importance of designing AI systems that balance complexity with clarity [3]. While deep learning models excel in capturing intricate patterns, their opacity remains a critical barrier to adoption in sensitive domains. By embedding interpretability into the model's structure, researchers can create systems that are both powerful and explainable. This dual focus on performance and transparency is essential for advancing the field of XAI and ensuring that AI technologies can be effectively utilized in real-world scenarios where human oversight and understanding are required [5]."

By leveraging domain-specific knowledge, they enhance the relevance and usability of explanations, ensuring that XAI systems can meet the unique requirements of different sectors [11]. This interdisciplinary approach not only improves model transparency but also supports the development of more robust and context-aware explanations that align with user needs and regulatory standards.\n\nA key challenge in cross-domain XAI is the need for flexible and scalable evaluation metrics that can capture the varying priorities of different applications [2]. Traditional metrics often focus on technical aspects like model fidelity or interpretability, but interdisciplinary frameworks emphasize additional dimensions such as user trust, decision impact, and ethical compliance. This necessitates the design of evaluation protocols that integrate both quantitative and qualitative measures, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of XAI systems [2]. Furthermore, these frameworks often incorporate feedback loops between domain experts and AI developers, fostering a collaborative environment that ensures explanations are both technically sound and practically useful.\n\nInterdisciplinary XAI frameworks also play a vital role in addressing the broader societal implications of AI, such as fairness, accountability, and transparency [4]. By drawing on methodologies from social sciences and law, they help bridge the gap between technical implementations and real-world consequences. This integration enables the creation of XAI systems that not only explain model behavior but also support ethical decision-making and regulatory compliance [3]. As AI continues to permeate critical domains, the development of such frameworks is essential to ensure that explainability remains a central component of responsible AI deployment, fostering trust and enabling informed human-AI collaboration [9]."

These approaches leverage concepts such as superposition, entanglement, and probabilistic state representation to provide deeper insights into the decision-making processes of complex models. By formulating model behavior through quantum-inspired mathematical frameworks, researchers can uncover hidden patterns and relationships that are often obscured in conventional statistical analyses. This not only improves the transparency of AI systems but also enables more robust and interpretable feature selection and model validation.\n\nStatistical methods, when combined with quantum-inspired principles, offer a dual advantage in model interpretability by addressing both the structural and probabilistic aspects of decision-making. Techniques such as probabilistic graphical models, Bayesian inference, and quantum-inspired optimization algorithms are employed to model uncertainty and provide more nuanced explanations of model outputs. These methods facilitate the identification of critical features and their interactions, allowing for a more granular understanding of how input variables influence predictions. Furthermore, the integration of statistical rigor ensures that the interpretability gains are not at the expense of model performance or reliability.\n\nThe application of quantum-inspired and statistical methods in model interpretability is particularly valuable in domains where transparency and trust are paramount, such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. By bridging the gap between abstract quantum theory and practical machine learning, these approaches provide a foundation for developing more interpretable and accountable AI systems [17].

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), known for their effectiveness in image and signal processing, often operate as black-box models, making it difficult to understand their decision-making processes [2]. To address this, XAI techniques such as feature visualization, saliency maps, and gradient-based methods have been integrated into CNNs to provide insights into how features are extracted and utilized. These methods allow domain experts to validate model decisions, ensuring alignment with real-world constraints and improving trust in AI systems. Hybrid XAI frameworks further enhance this by combining model-specific explanations with domain knowledge, offering a more comprehensive understanding of model behavior [4].\n\nIn specific domains like healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity, the need for explainability is even more pronounced due to regulatory and ethical considerations. For instance, in medical diagnostics, CNN-based XAI can highlight regions of interest in medical images, aiding clinicians in verifying model predictions. Similarly, in finance, hybrid XAI models can combine rule-based systems with deep learning to ensure compliance with regulatory standards while maintaining predictive accuracy [21]. These approaches not only improve model interpretability but also enable post-hoc adjustments, allowing domain experts to refine model outputs based on additional insights. This synergy between CNNs and XAI is particularly valuable in high-stakes environments where decisions must be both accurate and justifiable.\n\nThe integration of CNNs with XAI techniques is also being explored in emerging areas such as autonomous systems and social robotics, where human-AI collaboration is essential. By leveraging domain-specific knowledge, hybrid XAI models can adapt to dynamic environments and provide explanations that align with human reasoning [20]. This is crucial for ensuring that AI systems are not only effective but also understandable and trustworthy [9].

ABMs simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous agents to assess their effects on the system as a whole, while RL enables agents to learn optimal decision-making strategies through trial and error. Integrating explainability into these frameworks allows researchers to trace the reasoning behind agent behaviors and decision outcomes, thereby enhancing model transparency. This is particularly important in complex environments where agent interactions can lead to emergent system-level behaviors that are difficult to predict or interpret without proper explanation mechanisms.\n\nIn the context of ABMs, explainability techniques such as rule extraction, feature attribution, and visualization help uncover the underlying decision rules that guide agent behavior. These methods enable users to understand how individual agent actions contribute to broader system dynamics, facilitating debugging, validation, and refinement of the model. Similarly, in RL, explainability is essential for interpreting the reward structures and policy learning processes that drive agent decision-making. Techniques like attention mechanisms, policy decomposition, and counterfactual explanations provide insights into how agents weigh different actions and outcomes, ensuring that their behaviors align with desired objectives and ethical constraints.\n\nThe synergy between ABMs and RL in explainable AI systems offers a powerful approach for modeling and understanding complex, dynamic environments.

Graph-based models, on the other hand, excel at representing relational data and capturing interactions between entities, offering a natural framework for explaining relationships within the data. By integrating transformer and graph-based architectures with XAI, researchers can enhance model interpretability while preserving performance on complex tasks.\n\nRecent advancements in transformer-based XAI include attention visualization, layer-wise relevance propagation, and feature attribution methods that dissect the model’s internal workings. These techniques help identify salient input features and their contributions to predictions, making the model's behavior more comprehensible. Similarly, graph-based XAI methods leverage node and edge importance scores, subgraph extraction, and graph neural network (GNN) interpretability to explain predictions in relational data. Techniques such as the Jumping Knowledge (JK) mechanism in GNNs improve model robustness by aggregating information from multiple layers, while XAI modules can further refine these explanations by filtering out irrelevant or misleading patterns.\n\nThe synergy between transformers and graph-based models in XAI offers a powerful approach for handling high-dimensional, interconnected data. By combining the strengths of both architectures, researchers can develop more interpretable and reliable models for real-world applications. This integration not only enhances the transparency of AI systems but also supports human-AI collaboration, enabling domain experts to validate and refine model decisions [9]. As the demand for explainable and trustworthy AI grows, the development of hybrid transformer and graph-based XAI methods will play a pivotal role in advancing the field."

Universal XAI frameworks aim to provide generalizable explanation methods applicable across diverse domains, emphasizing model-agnostic techniques that can be applied to any machine learning model [22]. These frameworks often focus on technical aspects such as feature importance, decision pathways, and model transparency, enabling users to understand the rationale behind predictions without requiring domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, discipline-based XAI frameworks are tailored to specific application areas, incorporating domain constraints, expert knowledge, and contextual reasoning to generate explanations that align with human cognitive processes. This approach ensures that explanations are not only technically sound but also meaningful and actionable within the specific domain context.\n\nThe development of universal XAI frameworks faces challenges in balancing generality with depth, as broad methods may lack the specificity needed for complex or domain-sensitive tasks. Discipline-based frameworks, while more contextually relevant, require extensive customization and integration of domain-specific knowledge, which can limit their adaptability. Both approaches, however, share the common goal of improving model transparency, enabling users to trust, audit, and refine AI systems effectively [3]. The integration of domain knowledge into XAI methods is particularly critical in high-stakes applications such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, where decisions must align with established practices and ethical considerations [7].\n\nRecent advancements in XAI have led to hybrid frameworks that combine elements of both universal and discipline-based approaches [2]. These hybrid models leverage general explanation techniques while incorporating domain-specific constraints and reasoning patterns to enhance interpretability [9]. Such frameworks are essential for addressing the limitations of purely technical or purely domain-driven methods, offering a balanced solution that supports both model transparency and contextual relevance. As AI systems become more complex and pervasive, the development of robust XAI frameworks that can adapt to evolving requirements and domain-specific needs remains a critical research direction [5]."

By embedding explainability mechanisms at various stages of model development, such as feature selection, training, and inference, engineers can enhance the transparency of complex systems, making them more auditable and user-friendly. This engineering perspective shifts the focus from post-hoc explanation methods to proactive design strategies that align with both technical and human-centric requirements.\n\nModel transparency involves making the internal workings of AI systems accessible and comprehensible to stakeholders, including developers, users, and regulators [13]. It encompasses a range of techniques, from feature attribution and decision path visualization to modular decomposition of model components. These methods enable users to trace how inputs are transformed into outputs, identify biases, and assess the reliability of predictions. Transparent models are particularly vital in high-stakes applications such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, where errors can have significant consequences. By fostering a deeper understanding of model behavior, transparency supports better decision-making, regulatory compliance, and user trust.\n\nThe integration of explainability engineering into AI development also facilitates model debugging, improvement, and adaptation [18]. It allows for the identification of failure modes and the refinement of model architectures to enhance performance and robustness. Furthermore, it enables the creation of dynamic post-processing modules that can adjust model outputs based on explainability insights.

By leveraging multi-objective optimization, researchers can balance the competing demands of explanation quality and model performance, ensuring that the resulting explanations are both meaningful and aligned with user needs. This approach is especially relevant in scenarios where a single explanation may not suffice, and a range of alternative explanations must be considered to capture the nuances of model behavior [9].\n\nReinforcement learning further enhances the capabilities of XAI by enabling adaptive and dynamic explanation generation [12]. RL frameworks allow the system to learn optimal explanation strategies through interaction with the environment, refining its ability to produce explanations that are tailored to specific contexts and user requirements. This is particularly beneficial in complex domains such as time series analysis, where the sequential nature of data introduces additional challenges in interpretation. By integrating RL with multi-objective optimization, researchers can develop systems that not only generate accurate explanations but also continuously improve their performance based on feedback and evolving conditions.

This is particularly valuable in scenarios where multiple explanations may exist for a single prediction, and the goal is to identify the most plausible or coherent one [26]. The probabilistic perspective also allows for the quantification of uncertainty in explanations, which is crucial for high-stakes applications where reliability is paramount.\n\nIn the context of explanation reconciliation, Bayesian methods often involve modeling the relationships between input features, model outputs, and potential explanations through probabilistic graphical models or hierarchical Bayesian structures. These models can incorporate both data-driven and domain-specific knowledge, allowing for more interpretable and context-aware explanations. Additionally, techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference are used to approximate complex posterior distributions, enabling the generation of explanations that are not only accurate but also robust to noise and variability in the input data. By treating explanations as probabilistic hypotheses, these approaches facilitate a more dynamic and adaptive reconciliation process, where explanations can be refined as new information becomes available.\n\nThe integration of probabilistic and Bayesian methods into explanation reconciliation also opens new avenues for addressing the subjective nature of explanations.

Such properties are particularly important in high-stakes applications where model decisions directly impact human lives or financial outcomes. Evaluating stability and robustness helps identify potential weaknesses in XAI techniques and guides the development of more reliable interpretability frameworks [4].\n\nThe evaluation of stability and robustness in XAI explanations often involves systematic perturbation of input data or model configurations to observe the resulting changes in generated explanations [28]. Techniques such as input perturbation, model perturbation, and feature ablation are commonly used to test the resilience of XAI methods. These approaches help quantify how much an explanation changes under different conditions, providing insights into the method's reliability. For instance, a robust XAI method should maintain consistent feature importance rankings or counterfactual suggestions even when minor changes are introduced to the input. However, the effectiveness of these methods varies across different data types, such as images, text, and time series, highlighting the need for domain-specific evaluation strategies.\n\nIn addition to empirical testing, theoretical frameworks are increasingly being developed to analyze the stability and robustness of XAI explanations [11].
