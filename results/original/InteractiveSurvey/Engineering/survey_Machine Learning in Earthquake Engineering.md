## 4.2 Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Ground Motion Prediction

### 4.2.1 Integration of domain knowledge with data-driven models
The integration of domain knowledge with data-driven models has emerged as a critical approach in advancing seismic analysis and prediction. Traditional physics-based models often rely on predefined functional forms that may not fully capture the complexity of real-world seismic phenomena. In contrast, data-driven models, particularly those leveraging machine learning, can adapt to complex patterns but may lack interpretability and physical consistency. To address these limitations, recent studies have focused on combining the strengths of both paradigms. By embedding domain-specific knowledge—such as geological structures, material properties, and physical laws—into the learning process, these hybrid models improve predictive accuracy while maintaining a degree of transparency and physical plausibility. This integration is particularly valuable in scenarios with limited data, where prior knowledge can guide the learning process and mitigate overfitting.

Several methodologies have been proposed to achieve this integration, including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), symbolic learning, and transfer learning. PINNs incorporate physical constraints directly into the loss function, ensuring that the model adheres to known governing equations. Symbolic learning, on the other hand, leverages domain knowledge to construct function libraries that guide the discovery of predictive models. Transfer learning further enhances data efficiency by leveraging knowledge from related domains, reducing the need for extensive training data in the target domain [11]. These approaches not only improve model performance but also provide deeper insights into the underlying physical processes, enabling more reliable and interpretable predictions in seismic hazard assessment and ground motion modeling.

Despite these advancements, challenges remain in effectively encoding and integrating domain knowledge into data-driven frameworks. The complexity of seismic systems, coupled with the variability of geological conditions, necessitates robust and flexible integration strategies.

### 4.3.1 Knowledge transfer across seismic domains for reduced computation
Knowledge transfer across seismic domains for reduced computation aims to leverage data and models from well-characterized seismic regions to improve the accuracy and efficiency of analyses in data-scarce areas. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in certain regions by transferring learned representations or models from source domains with abundant data to target domains with sparse data [12]. By doing so, it reduces the computational burden associated with training complex models from scratch, while maintaining or even enhancing predictive performance. This technique is particularly valuable in seismic hazard analysis, where ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) and other models often require extensive data to capture local site effects and regional variability [13].

The application of knowledge transfer in seismology involves adapting machine learning models, such as deep neural networks, to generalize across different geological and tectonic settings [5]. These models can learn domain-invariant features that are applicable to multiple regions, thereby reducing the need for extensive retraining. For instance, models trained on data from the NGA-West2 project can be fine-tuned for use in regions with limited strong-motion data, improving the reliability of hazard assessments. This strategy not only accelerates model development but also enhances the robustness of predictions by incorporating prior knowledge from diverse seismic environments [4]. The success of such approaches depends on the similarity between source and target domains, as well as the ability to account for domain-specific variations through appropriate adaptation techniques.

Recent advances in transfer learning have demonstrated significant potential in reducing computational costs while maintaining model accuracy [11]. Techniques such as domain adaptation and meta-learning enable models to generalize across different seismic conditions, even when the underlying data distributions differ. These methods are especially beneficial in scenarios where data collection is expensive or logistically challenging, such as in offshore or remote regions. By minimizing the reliance on large, region-specific datasets, knowledge transfer contributes to more efficient and scalable seismic analysis [7].

Probabilistic methods, in contrast, account for these uncertainties by generating a distribution of possible velocity models. This approach is particularly valuable in regions with complex geological structures, where the velocity field can vary significantly across different spatial scales. By incorporating statistical techniques, such as Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, these models provide a more comprehensive understanding of the subsurface, enabling more robust predictions of seismic wave propagation and ground motion.

Recent advancements in computational power and data availability have facilitated the development of more sophisticated probabilistic models. These models integrate diverse data sources, including seismic travel times, surface wave dispersion, and well logs, to constrain the velocity structure. The use of hierarchical Bayesian frameworks allows for the incorporation of prior geological knowledge and the quantification of both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. Additionally, machine learning techniques have been increasingly employed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of velocity model inversion. By leveraging data-driven approaches, these models can capture complex patterns and nonlinear relationships that may be difficult to represent with conventional physics-based methods, thereby improving the reliability of subsurface velocity estimates.

Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the application of probabilistic modeling to subsurface velocity structures. The high dimensionality of the parameter space and the nonlinearity of the forward problem pose significant computational challenges. Moreover, the quality and density of the input data can greatly influence the accuracy of the resulting models. Addressing these challenges requires the development of more efficient algorithms and the integration of multi-source data in a consistent and interpretable manner.
