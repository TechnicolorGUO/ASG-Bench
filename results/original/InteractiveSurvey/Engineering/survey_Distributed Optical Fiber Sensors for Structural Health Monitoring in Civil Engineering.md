Real-time signal processing and in-sensor computing have become essential for enhancing the performance of optical and radar-based systems in dynamic environments. Traditional architectures often rely on centralized processing units that introduce latency and consume significant power, particularly when handling large volumes of data from distributed sensor arrays. In contrast, in-sensor computing integrates signal demodulation and analysis directly within the sensor, enabling faster decision-making and reducing the need for external computational resources. This approach is particularly advantageous in applications requiring immediate response, such as real-time health monitoring or environmental sensing, where delays can compromise accuracy and effectiveness. By processing signals locally, in-sensor computing also minimizes data transmission overhead, making it ideal for deployment in remote or resource-constrained settings.

In dynamic environments, the ability to adapt to changing conditions is critical. Real-time signal processing techniques, such as adaptive filtering and machine learning-based algorithms, allow systems to dynamically adjust to variations in signal characteristics, noise levels, and environmental factors. These methods enable robust and reliable operation even under unpredictable or fluctuating conditions. In-sensor computing further enhances this adaptability by embedding processing capabilities directly within the sensor hardware, allowing for on-the-fly adjustments without relying on external systems. This integration not only improves response times but also reduces the overall system complexity and power consumption. For instance, in optical fiber sensing applications, in-sensor computing can enable real-time analysis of strain, temperature, or vibration data, facilitating immediate detection of anomalies or structural changes.

These impairments, such as photon loss and nonlinear effects in optical fibers, introduce uncertainties that affect the performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Traditional linear models are insufficient to capture the complex interactions between these perturbations and the quantum states being transmitted. As a result, advanced analytical techniques are required to model the nonlinear behavior of quantum channels and predict the resulting error rates. This analysis is critical for designing robust QKD systems that can maintain security and reliability under real-world conditions.

Error rate modeling in quantum systems involves quantifying the probability of bit errors introduced by nonlinear perturbations, such as fiber nonlinearities and signal distortions. These errors can arise from both linear and nonlinear interactions within the quantum channel, complicating the accurate estimation of the quantum bit error rate (QBER). By incorporating nonlinear perturbation terms into error rate models, researchers can better predict the performance of QKD systems under varying channel conditions. This approach enables the development of more accurate and reliable QKD protocols, which are essential for practical quantum communication networks.

The integration of nonlinear perturbation analysis with error rate modeling provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the performance of quantum communication systems.

## 5.3 Data-Driven Sensing and Traffic Monitoring

### 5.3.1 Physics-informed learning for traffic state estimation and congestion prediction
Physics-informed learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for traffic state estimation and congestion prediction, integrating domain-specific physical principles with data-driven models to enhance accuracy and interpretability. This approach leverages the underlying dynamics of traffic flow, such as conservation laws and kinematic wave theory, to constrain the learning process. By embedding these physical constraints into the model architecture, physics-informed learning ensures that predictions remain consistent with real-world traffic behavior, even in data-scarce scenarios. This integration not only improves the reliability of traffic state estimation but also enables more robust congestion prediction by capturing the nonlinear interactions between vehicles and road infrastructure.

Recent advancements in physics-informed learning have focused on hybrid models that combine classical traffic flow models with deep learning techniques. These models utilize differential equations to represent traffic dynamics while employing neural networks to learn complex patterns from sensor data. For instance, graph neural networks have been used to model the spatial dependencies between road segments, while recurrent neural networks capture temporal variations in traffic conditions. By fusing these elements, the resulting models achieve higher accuracy in estimating traffic states and predicting congestion onset. Furthermore, the incorporation of physical constraints allows for better generalization across different traffic scenarios, making these models more adaptable to real-world applications.

The effectiveness of physics-informed learning in traffic state estimation and congestion prediction is further enhanced by the use of real-time data from various sources, including GPS, loop detectors, and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. These data streams provide the necessary inputs for training and validating the models, ensuring they reflect current traffic conditions. Additionally, the integration of physical models helps in reducing the reliance on large-scale labeled datasets, which are often difficult to obtain. As a result, physics-informed learning offers a promising solution for developing scalable and efficient traffic monitoring systems that can support intelligent transportation infrastructure and improve urban mobility.

### 5.3.2 Position and trajectory detection using optical fiber signals for mobility analysis
Position and trajectory detection using optical fiber signals for mobility analysis has emerged as a promising approach for real-time and continuous monitoring of movement in various environments. This technique leverages the unique properties of optical fibers, particularly their ability to detect and localize vibrations and acoustic disturbances along their entire length. By analyzing the backscattered light signals, such as those from Rayleigh or Brillouin scattering, it is possible to infer the presence, location, and movement of objects, including vehicles. This capability is especially valuable in transportation monitoring, where the ability to track vehicle positions and trajectories without relying on traditional sensors offers significant advantages in terms of coverage, cost, and robustness.

Recent advancements in distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) and phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry (Phase-OTDR) have enabled the development of sophisticated algorithms for position and trajectory detection. These methods process raw fiber data to extract meaningful information about moving objects, such as vehicle speed, direction, and density. The use of signal processing techniques, including wavelet transforms and machine learning models, has improved the accuracy and reliability of these systems. Moreover, the ability to operate in adverse environmental conditions, such as tunnels or highways, without dead spots or interference from electromagnetic signals, makes optical fiber-based mobility analysis a compelling solution for intelligent transportation systems.

Despite the progress, challenges remain in achieving high precision and scalability in complex environments. Factors such as environmental noise, signal variability, and the need for real-time processing pose significant technical hurdles. Future research should focus on enhancing the robustness of detection algorithms, optimizing data processing techniques, and integrating multi-sensor fusion approaches to improve overall performance. As the demand for continuous and wide-area monitoring grows, the development of more efficient and accurate optical fiber-based mobility analysis systems will be critical for applications in smart cities, traffic management, and infrastructure safety.
