By manipulating surface properties and material composition, it is possible to achieve improved biocompatibility, mechanical strength, and bioactivity. Gradient material design, in particular, allows for the creation of scaffolds with spatially varying properties, such as porosity, stiffness, and composition, which can better mimic the complexity of natural tissues [4]. This approach addresses the limitations of conventional uniform scaffolds, which often fail to provide the necessary mechanical and biological cues for effective tissue regeneration [4]. The integration of surface engineering techniques, such as plasma coatings and chemical functionalization, further enhances the interaction between the scaffold and the surrounding biological environment.\n\nGradient material design is particularly advantageous in the development of functionally graded (FG) scaffolds, which are engineered to exhibit gradual changes in material properties across their structure [4]. These gradients can be tailored to match the mechanical and biological requirements of different regions within a tissue defect. For instance, scaffolds with porosity gradients can facilitate nutrient diffusion and cell infiltration while maintaining structural integrity. Similarly, gradients in stiffness can help reduce stress shielding and promote better load distribution. The use of AM techniques, such as robocasting and 3D printing, enables precise control over these gradients, allowing for the fabrication of complex, patient-specific scaffolds [7]. This level of customization is essential for applications in orthopedic and dental implants, where the mechanical and biological performance of the implant is crucial for long-term success.\n\nThe combination of surface engineering and gradient material design offers a powerful strategy for developing advanced biomaterials that can meet the demands of modern regenerative medicine. Surface modifications, such as the application of bioactive coatings or the introduction of functional groups, can enhance the interaction between the scaffold and the surrounding tissue. At the same time, gradient material design ensures that the scaffold provides the appropriate mechanical and biological environment for tissue growth [7]. This dual approach not only improves the performance of the scaffold but also increases its adaptability to different clinical scenarios. As research in this area continues to advance, the integration of these techniques is expected to lead to the development of more effective and durable biomaterials for a wide range of biomedical applications."

Studies have demonstrated that MBG-75S and NanoMBG-75S can modulate macrophage behavior, with specific effects observed on the expression of surface markers like CD80 (M1) and CD206 (M2) [11]. These findings highlight the importance of material design in directing immune responses for successful tissue integration and regeneration.\n\nCytotoxicity assessments are essential to evaluate the safety profile of MBGs and their potential for clinical translation. In vitro studies using macrophage cell lines such as RAW 264.7 and J774A.1 have shown that MBGs can induce varying degrees of cytotoxicity, which is influenced by the release of ions such as zinc, copper, and silver. The mode of exposure—direct contact or indirect via transwells—also affects the cellular response, as ionic products may differ from the effects of direct biomaterial-cell interaction. These experimental strategies help distinguish between the contributions of ionic dissolution and physical contact in modulating macrophage function, providing critical insights into the biocompatibility of MBGs [11].\n\nThe interplay between macrophage polarization and cytotoxicity is further complicated by the dynamic nature of the inflammatory microenvironment. MBGs with tailored surface properties, such as zwitterionic functionalization, have been shown to reduce bacterial adhesion and improve cytocompatibility [12]. This suggests that modifying MBG surfaces can influence macrophage behavior, potentially shifting the polarization towards a more reparative phenotype. Understanding these mechanisms is vital for developing MBGs that not only support tissue regeneration but also modulate the immune response to prevent chronic inflammation and enhance therapeutic outcomes."

These assessments typically involve in vitro studies where the behavior of osteoblasts and fibroblasts is analyzed in both monoculture and coculture systems. Such studies aim to evaluate how these cell types communicate and influence each other's functions, including proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix production. The presence of fibroblasts can modulate the osteogenic potential of osteoblasts, often through paracrine signaling or direct cell-to-cell contact, which is essential for the development of functional bone tissue. Understanding these interactions is vital for designing biomaterials that support both osteogenic and fibroblastic activities, ensuring optimal tissue integration and repair [2].\n\nThe assessment of osteoblast and fibroblast interactions is often facilitated by advanced biomaterials that provide a controlled microenvironment. For instance, mesoporous bioactive glasses (MBGs) have been used to study how surface properties and released ions influence cell behavior [11]. These materials can be engineered to support osteoblast differentiation while simultaneously managing fibroblast overgrowth, which is crucial for preventing fibrous encapsulation of implants. Additionally, the incorporation of bioactive compounds or antibiotics into these materials can further modulate the cellular response, promoting bone regeneration while inhibiting microbial colonization. Such multifunctional systems are essential for addressing complex clinical scenarios, such as bone defects associated with infections or tumors.\n\nRecent advancements in biomaterial design have enabled more precise control over the interactions between osteoblasts and fibroblasts. Techniques such as surface functionalization, controlled drug release, and the use of stimuli-responsive materials have enhanced the ability to tailor cellular responses. These approaches not only support the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts but also regulate fibroblast activity, ensuring a balanced tissue regeneration process. By integrating these strategies, researchers can develop more effective biomaterials that mimic the natural bone microenvironment, ultimately improving the outcomes of tissue engineering and implant-based therapies [2]."

Studies have shown that the controlled release of metal ions, such as zinc, copper, and silver, from bioceramic scaffolds can potentiate the activity of antibiotics, reducing the required concentration and minimizing the risk of resistance development [1]. This synergy is particularly relevant in the context of bioactive glasses and mesoporous bioactive glasses (MBGs), which can be engineered to release ions in a sustained manner, thereby supporting long-term antimicrobial action [11].\n\nThe physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and scaffolds play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness of antibiotic-metal ion synergy. Factors such as particle size, surface charge, and functionalization influence the interaction between the agents and bacterial cells. For instance, nanoparticles with a neutral or slightly positive charge may enhance adhesion to the mucus membrane, improving drug absorption, while negatively charged particles may hinder biliary excretion [13]. Additionally, the incorporation of zwitterionic functional groups, such as those derived from amino acids, can reduce nonspecific bacterial adhesion, thereby enhancing the targeted delivery of antibiotics and metal ions. These properties are crucial for optimizing the therapeutic outcome and minimizing off-target effects.\n\nRecent advancements in stimuli-responsive systems have further expanded the potential of antibiotic-metal ion synergy. By designing materials that respond to specific biochemical or physical cues, researchers can achieve on-demand release of therapeutic agents, ensuring localized and controlled delivery. This approach not only enhances the efficacy of the treatment but also reduces systemic toxicity.
