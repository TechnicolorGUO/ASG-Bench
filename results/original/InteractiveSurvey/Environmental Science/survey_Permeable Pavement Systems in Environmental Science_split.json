The study highlights the importance of multi-scale modeling, quantum mechanical approaches, and advanced simulation techniques in understanding the behavior of these materials at the molecular and macroscopic levels. It explores the integration of experimental data with theoretical models, demonstrating how such synergies enhance the accuracy of predictions and the design of materials with tailored properties. The analysis of gas adsorption, nanoparticle interactions, and diffusion mechanisms reveals the complex interplay between material structure and functionality, while the discussion on machine learning and first-principles calculations underscores the transformative potential of these tools in accelerating material discovery. The findings also emphasize the significance of porous structures in applications such as catalysis, energy storage, and environmental remediation, reinforcing the need for continued research into their fundamental properties and performance characteristics.\n\nThe significance of this survey lies in its ability to synthesize a broad range of methodologies and findings from diverse fields, offering a unified perspective on the current state of research in porous and structured materials. By bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental validations, the paper provides a valuable reference for researchers aiming to advance material science and engineering. It also identifies key challenges, such as the need for more accurate simulation techniques, the integration of multi-scale approaches, and the development of predictive models that can address real-world complexities. These insights not only contribute to academic knowledge but also have practical implications for industries seeking sustainable and high-performance materials. The paper’s emphasis on the interplay between computational and experimental methods highlights the importance of a multi-disciplinary approach in driving innovation and solving pressing environmental and technological challenges.\n\nLooking ahead, there is a clear need for further research that integrates advanced computational tools with experimental validation to address the limitations of current models. The development of more efficient and accurate simulation techniques, along with the incorporation of machine learning and artificial intelligence, will be crucial in unlocking new possibilities for material design and optimization. Additionally, interdisciplinary collaboration across physics, chemistry, engineering, and data science will be essential in advancing the field. As the demand for sustainable and high-performance materials continues to grow, the insights presented in this survey serve as a foundation for future studies, guiding the development of next-generation materials that can meet the evolving needs of society. The ongoing exploration of porous and structured materials holds great promise for addressing global challenges and fostering technological progress in the years to come."
