These models represent biological components as binary states (on/off) and use logical rules to describe interactions, enabling the simulation of complex regulatory behaviors. In the context of circadian rhythms, Boolean models are particularly useful for capturing the oscillatory behavior of core clock genes and their interactions. By abstracting the system into discrete states, these models can efficiently simulate the temporal dynamics of circadian networks, providing insights into the underlying regulatory mechanisms without requiring detailed kinetic parameters.\n\nThe application of Boolean models to circadian rhythm analysis often involves the construction of logic-based representations of established differential equation (DE) models. This approach allows researchers to preserve the higher-order properties of the original models, such as photoperiod responses and phase relationships, while simplifying the computational complexity. Recent studies have demonstrated that Boolean models can accurately reproduce the oscillatory patterns observed in circadian systems, including the period and amplitude of gene expression cycles. Furthermore, these models can be calibrated using experimental data through fitting algorithms that optimize the logical rules to match observed dynamics, thereby enhancing their predictive power.\n\nBoolean models also offer a complementary approach to traditional DE-based methods by enabling the reverse engineering of circadian networks from time-series data [3]. Their simplicity and interpretability make them suitable for identifying key regulatory interactions and testing hypotheses about network structure. Additionally, Boolean models can be integrated with other modeling techniques, such as hybrid approaches that combine discrete and continuous dynamics, to capture both qualitative and quantitative aspects of circadian regulation [3].

In this approach, each gene is represented as a binary variable, either active (ON) or inactive (OFF), capturing the presence or absence of its gene products [3]. This binary abstraction allows for the modeling of complex regulatory interactions through logical functions, such as AND, OR, and NOT gates, which define how the state of a gene is determined by its upstream regulators [3]. By reducing the continuous nature of gene expression into discrete states, Boolean models offer a computationally efficient method for analyzing large-scale GRNs and simulating their dynamic behavior over time. This representation is particularly useful when the exact kinetic parameters of the network are unknown or difficult to measure.\n\nThe transition between discrete states in Boolean models is typically governed by a set of update rules that dictate how the state of each gene evolves based on the current states of its regulators. These update rules can be synchronous, where all genes are updated simultaneously, or asynchronous, where updates occur in a probabilistic or sequential manner. The choice of update mechanism significantly influences the model's ability to capture the temporal dynamics of gene regulation. Additionally, the discretization of gene expression levels introduces a thresholding process, where expression values above a defined cutoff are classified as ON, and those below are classified as OFF [3]. This thresholding step is critical for translating continuous experimental data into the binary framework of Boolean models.\n\nDespite its simplicity, the discrete state representation of GRNs has limitations in capturing the full complexity of gene regulatory mechanisms, such as graded responses and continuous interactions. However, it serves as a foundational step towards more detailed models, such as differential equation-based formulations, by providing a structured way to identify key regulatory relationships and dynamical patterns. The use of Boolean models also facilitates the integration of high-throughput data, enabling the identification of distinct gene expression programs and their functional implications. This approach is particularly valuable in studying systems with oscillatory or steady-state dynamics, where the discrete representation can reveal underlying regulatory logic and temporal behavior."

These techniques involve solving an ill-posed inverse problem, where the goal is to estimate the location and intensity of light-emitting sources based on boundary measurements. The challenge arises from the fact that the light propagation through tissue is governed by the radiative transfer equation, which is highly non-linear and sensitive to noise. As a result, various regularization strategies, such as Tikhonov regularization and sparsity constraints, are employed to stabilize the solution and improve the accuracy of source localization.\n\nThe development of inverse problem techniques in BLT has been driven by the need for high-resolution, non-invasive imaging of gene expression and cellular activity in living organisms. Advanced methods, including multispectral imaging and spectral derivative data, have been introduced to enhance the reconstruction process by exploiting the unique spectral signatures of bioluminescent reporters. These approaches allow for more accurate separation of multiple sources and improved discrimination of signal from background noise. Additionally, the integration of anatomical information from complementary imaging modalities, such as MRI or CT, has further enhanced the spatial resolution and specificity of BLT reconstructions.\n\nDespite these advancements, the inverse problem in BLT remains computationally intensive and sensitive to modeling assumptions.

      "content": "Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a powerful framework for data detrending and oscillation detection by modeling the underlying trends without assuming a specific functional form [5]. Unlike traditional polynomial fitting, GPs offer a probabilistic approach that captures uncertainty in the trend estimation. By employing the squared exponential (SE) covariance function, the model can flexibly adapt to the data's structure, effectively separating long-term trends from short-term oscillations [5]. This non-parametric nature of GPs allows for more accurate and robust detrending, particularly in scenarios where the trend is complex or unknown. The flexibility of GPs makes them well-suited for applications where the data may contain multiple scales of variation, ensuring that oscillatory components are not erroneously attributed to the trend.\n\nThe detection of oscillations within a time series can be achieved by comparing the likelihoods of models with oscillatory and non-oscillatory covariance functions [5]. This approach leverages the probabilistic framework of GPs to compute the probability of the data under each model, enabling a statistical assessment of periodicity. By calculating the likelihood ratio between the two models, one can obtain a confidence estimate for the presence of oscillations. This method is particularly advantageous as it avoids the need for arbitrary thresholding or manual inspection, providing an objective and data-driven criterion for oscillation detection. The ability to quantify the confidence in periodicity enhances the interpretability of the results and supports more reliable downstream analysis.\n\nSynthetic data plays a crucial role in validating the effectiveness of GP-based detrending and oscillation detection. By generating non-oscillatory data with known properties, researchers can systematically evaluate the performance of the models under controlled conditions. This validation process ensures that the detected oscillations are not artifacts of the detrending method but genuine features of the data. Additionally, the use of synthetic data allows for the exploration of various scenarios, such as different noise levels or trend complexities, further strengthening the reliability of the approach. Overall, the integration of GPs into data analysis workflows offers a principled and flexible solution for both detrending and oscillation detection."

Traditional statistical methods often rely on assumptions that non-oscillatory behavior is represented by white noise, which fails to capture the correlations between consecutive time points.

To address this, a mechanistic model based on Gaussian processes has been introduced, offering a forward modeling approach to define expected patterns of both oscillatory and non-oscillatory dynamics. This model provides a more accurate framework for analyzing bioluminescence time series by incorporating the underlying biological mechanisms rather than relying on ad hoc waveform assumptions.\n\nThe application of Gaussian processes enables the quantification of in vivo bioluminescence signal variation over time, allowing for the integration of time-resolved curves across different imaging projections. This approach facilitates the correction of intensity variations in spectral images, ensuring that the input data for subsequent analyses, such as quantitative bioluminescence tomography (QBLT), are normalized and representative of the true biological dynamics. By constructing animal-specific time-resolved bioluminescence curves, the method effectively mitigates the impact of inter-animal and physiological variability, enhancing the reliability of periodicity detection.

By leveraging mechanistic descriptions of gene expression, these models can account for the stochastic nature of biological systems and provide a more accurate representation of oscillatory behavior. The integration of Gaussian processes into periodicity analysis not only improves the detection of rhythmic patterns but also enhances the interpretability of time-series data. This approach bridges the gap between empirical observations and theoretical modeling, offering a powerful tool for studying the temporal dynamics of bioluminescent signals in both experimental and clinical settings."

      "content": "The estimation of biophoton emission in retinotopic neurons involves analyzing the intrinsic optical signals generated within visual cortical areas, particularly in the primary visual cortex (V1) [6]. These biophotons, emitted from neurocellular processes, are hypothesized to contribute to the formation of internal visual representations, such as negative afterimages, even in the absence of external light [1]. By integrating spectral sensitivity functions of retinal opsins, the visual transduction process can be modeled using convolutional layers, where each kernel represents the spectral response of specific photopigments [7]. This approach allows for the quantification of light detection efficiency across wavelengths, providing a framework to estimate biophoton emission based on the integral of spectral sensitivity over the visible spectrum.\n\nDespite the potential of this model, challenges remain in accurately capturing the dynamic nature of biophoton emission [6]. The spectral sensitivity of retinal opsins is typically approximated using Gaussian functions centered at their peak wavelengths, and mutations at specific amino acid residues influence these functions. However, direct optimization of the opsin layer in computational models often results in unrestricted spectral responses, which deviate from biological constraints. To address this, prior knowledge of spectral tuning sites and empirical data on biophoton production rates must be incorporated. This ensures that the model aligns with the evolutionary and biochemical properties of retinal photopigments, enhancing its biological relevance.\n\nEstimating biophoton emission in retinotopic neurons also requires considering the spatial and temporal dynamics of light emission within neural circuits. Based on experimental observations, retinotopic visual neurons may emit between $10^8$ to $10^9$ biophotons per second, potentially sufficient to generate intrinsic visual representations during perception [6]. This suggests that biophotons could serve as a biophysical substrate for visual imagery, complementing traditional neural signaling mechanisms. Further research is needed to validate these estimates and explore their implications for understanding the neural basis of visual perception and afterimages."

      "content": "The formation of negative afterimages has long been a subject of debate, particularly regarding the source of the persistent visual signals observed when the eyes are closed in darkness [1]. Traditional theories, such as photopigment bleaching, fail to fully explain the phenomenon, as they rely on external light exposure. Recent experimental evidence, including biophoton emission from isolated retinal tissues, suggests an alternative mechanism involving intrinsic biophotonic activity. These findings indicate that biophotons, generated within retinal cells, may contribute to the persistence of visual impressions even in the absence of external light. This biophotonic activity could serve as a basis for the neural representation of visual stimuli, offering a novel explanation for the generation of afterimages [1].\n\nThe visual transduction process involves the integration of spectral sensitivity functions across wavelengths, as mediated by opsins in the retina [7]. Each opsin type has a unique spectral response, and the perceived intensity for each is determined by the integral of its sensitivity function over the incident light spectrum [7]. This process can be modeled using a convolutional layer with spectral sensitivity kernels, where the weights represent the efficiency of light detection at different wavelengths. Such a model provides a framework for understanding how biophotons, emitted internally, may interact with these opsin-based mechanisms to influence visual perception and the formation of afterimages.\n\nIntrinsic biophotonic emissions, particularly in retinotopic visual areas, may act as a natural substrate for visual imagery [6]. These emissions, estimated to range from $10^8$ to $10^9$ photons per second, could support the creation of internal visual representations during perception. This suggests that biophotons might not only contribute to the initial visual signal but also sustain residual activity that underlies afterimage formation [1]. By integrating biophotonic mechanisms with existing neural models, a more comprehensive understanding of visual perception and its persistence can be achieved."

Traditional methods often struggle with noisy or ambiguous data, leading to reduced model performance. The proposed Ins-ATP model leverages MIL to effectively identify and focus on the relevant instances within an image, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of ATP estimation. By treating each image as a collection of instances, the model can learn to distinguish ATP-containing regions from irrelevant structures, such as vacuoles or background artifacts, which are common in organoid imaging.\n\nThe design of the Ins-ATP model incorporates a multi-instance learning strategy that enhances the ability to generalize across diverse organoid structures [8]. This approach allows the model to aggregate features from multiple instances within an image, leading to more reliable ATP concentration estimates. The model’s architecture is tailored to handle the unique challenges of organoid imaging, including the scarcity of labeled data and the presence of non-ATP-related objects. By optimizing the learning process through instance-level attention mechanisms, the model can effectively mitigate the impact of noise and improve overall prediction stability.\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of MIL into ATP estimation for organoids represents a significant advancement in the field, as it provides a novel framework for handling complex and heterogeneous image data [8]. The Ins-ATP model not only addresses the limitations of existing methods but also sets a foundation for future research in automated biomarker estimation. This work highlights the potential of MIL to transform how ATP is quantified in biological systems, paving the way for more accurate and scalable solutions in organoid-based studies."

      "level": 3,
      "content": "The evolutionary analysis of opsin function and color vision reveals a complex interplay between genetic adaptation and environmental pressures. Opsins, the photopigment proteins responsible for light detection in the retina, have undergone significant diversification across vertebrate lineages. This diversification is driven by the need to optimize spectral sensitivity in varying light environments, such as the deep sea, terrestrial habitats, and primate visual systems. Phylogenetic studies indicate that the ancestral opsin repertoire was likely limited, with subsequent gene duplications and mutations leading to the emergence of specialized photoreceptors. These evolutionary changes are reflected in the spectral tuning of opsins, which are often characterized by Gaussian-like functions centered at their peak sensitivity wavelengths. The conservation of specific amino acid residues across species further underscores the functional importance of these sites in maintaining optimal spectral responses.\n\nThe integration of computational frameworks with evolutionary models has enabled a deeper understanding of how opsin function has evolved over time. By reconstructing ancestral opsin sequences and simulating evolutionary transitions, researchers can infer the historical shifts in spectral sensitivity and color vision capabilities [7]. These models incorporate constraints such as the Gaussian approximation of spectral sensitivity functions and the role of key amino acid residues in tuning. However, direct optimization of opsin layers without such constraints often leads to unrealistic spectral profiles, highlighting the necessity of incorporating evolutionary and biophysical principles. This approach not only aids in understanding the past but also provides insights into the potential future trajectories of color vision adaptation in response to environmental changes.\n\nComparative studies across mammals, primates, and deep-sea organisms reveal striking differences in opsin evolution, reflecting their distinct ecological niches. For instance, primates exhibit a high degree of opsin diversity, supporting trichromatic vision, while deep-sea species often display simplified opsin repertoires adapted to low-light conditions. These findings suggest that the evolutionary pressures shaping opsin function are highly context-dependent. Furthermore, the emergence of novel photobiophysical mechanisms, such as delayed luminescence and bioluminescent emissions, may have influenced the development of color vision. Such insights contribute to a more comprehensive view of how opsin function and color perception have co-evolved across different species and environments [7]."

      "level": 3,
      "content": "Spontaneous and light-induced biophoton emission in eye tissues has emerged as a critical area of investigation, particularly in understanding the mechanisms underlying visual perception and afterimages [1]. Experimental studies have demonstrated that isolated eye tissues, including the retina, lens, and vitreous humor, emit biophotons both spontaneously and in response to external light [1]. These emissions are attributed to redox reactions and radical processes within cellular structures, suggesting that biophotons may serve as endogenous signals in visual processing [6]. The presence of delayed luminescence, or light reemission after illumination, further indicates that biophotons could play a role in maintaining visual signals beyond the immediate exposure to light, potentially influencing the formation of negative afterimages [1].\n\nThe spectral characteristics of biophoton emission align with the functional properties of retinal opsins, which are responsible for color vision. Each opsin exhibits a distinct spectral sensitivity, and the integration of these signals across the visual field generates the perception of color [7]. By modeling the retina as an opsin layer with convolutional kernels representing spectral sensitivity functions, it becomes possible to simulate how biophotons might contribute to visual transduction [7]. This approach highlights the potential for biophotons to act as intrinsic signals that interact with opsin activity, possibly modulating neural responses and contributing to the persistence of visual impressions even in the absence of external light.\n\nThe implications of biophoton emission extend beyond basic visual function, suggesting a deeper role in neural and cognitive processes [6]. The regulation of biophoton intensity within cells, as opposed to their mere by-product nature, points to a more active involvement in cellular communication and information processing. If biophotons are indeed involved in the generation of phosphene-like experiences or negative afterimages, they may provide a biophysical substrate for visual imagery and memory [6]. This perspective opens new avenues for exploring the interplay between biophotonic activity and higher-order brain functions, particularly in the context of visual perception and cognitive processing."

      "heading": "5.3.2 Delayed Luminescence and Photobiophysical Interpretations",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Delayed luminescence, a phenomenon involving the reemission of photons after exposure to light, has been observed in various biological systems, including in vitro preparations of rat ocular tissues [1]. This process is hypothesized to originate from the absorption of light by retinal lipid peroxidation products, which subsequently interact with photoreceptor molecules such as rhodopsin [6]. The resulting modifications can trigger the phototransduction cascade, leading to the perception of phosphene-like lights [6]. This mechanism suggests a direct link between biophotonic emissions and visual perception, offering a potential explanation for the persistence of negative afterimages even in the absence of external light [1]. The biophysical basis of delayed luminescence thus challenges traditional views of visual processing by introducing an intrinsic, light-independent component to visual signaling.\n\nThe debate surrounding the source of negative afterimages remains unresolved, with some theories attributing them to photopigment bleaching and others proposing intrinsic biophotonic mechanisms [1]. The observation of negative afterimages in dark environments suggests that the phenomenon cannot be solely attributed to external light exposure. Instead, it points to the possibility of endogenous biophoton emissions, which may originate from cellular processes such as metabolic activity or lipid peroxidation [6]. These emissions, when detected by photoreceptors, could generate persistent visual signals that are interpreted by the brain as afterimages. This interpretation aligns with findings that spontaneous and light-induced biophoton emissions occur in isolated ocular tissues, indicating a potential role for biophotons in visual perception.\n\nRecent studies have explored the relationship between bioluminescence and the evolution of multiple rod opsins, particularly in deep-sea organisms [7]. These organisms exhibit multiple rod opsins with distinct spectral sensitivities, which may be an adaptation to bioluminescent environments [7]. This evolutionary strategy suggests that biophotonic interactions play a crucial role in visual adaptation. Similarly, in the context of delayed luminescence, the presence of endogenous biophotons could influence visual processing by modulating opsin activity. Such insights highlight the importance of biophotonic mechanisms in both visual perception and the broader context of photobiological processes."
