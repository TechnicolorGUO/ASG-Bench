In the context of time-variant channel estimation, OFDM provides a structured framework for analyzing frequency-selective channels by dividing the available bandwidth into multiple orthogonal subcarriers. Each subcarrier experiences a relatively flat channel response, enabling the use of pilot-based or data-aided techniques for accurate estimation. However, the time-variant nature of the channel introduces additional complexity, as the channel response changes over time, necessitating dynamic estimation algorithms that can adapt to rapid variations. This is particularly crucial in mobile environments where Doppler effects and user mobility significantly impact channel characteristics.

Time-variant channel estimation for OFDM systems typically involves the use of filter banks or advanced signal processing techniques to extract the channel impulse response from the received signals. Traditional correlation-based methods may not suffice in highly dynamic scenarios, where the channel exhibits rapid fluctuations. Instead, filter bank-based approaches offer a more flexible and accurate means of estimating the time-variant frequency response by decomposing the signal into subbands and analyzing each subband independently. This allows for precise tracking of channel variations over time, which is essential for maintaining reliable communication in environments with high mobility or complex propagation conditions. The integration of such techniques with OFDM ensures that the system can effectively mitigate the effects of time-variant channels and maintain high data integrity.

The deployment approach must also be scalable and cost-effective, aligning with the goals of modular and flexible robotic systems. By integrating advanced signal processing techniques, such as MIMO and beamforming, acoustic signal deployment can be optimized to enhance performance and reduce interference in complex environments.

### 4.5.2 BER and channel capacity analysis in fading environments
The analysis of bit error rate (BER) and channel capacity in fading environments is critical for understanding the performance limits of communication systems operating in non-ideal conditions. In such environments, the channel characteristics vary over time and space, leading to signal degradation and reduced reliability. This section examines the impact of fading on the BER and channel capacity of different receiver architectures, particularly focusing on the performance of space division spatial diversity (SDSD) and space division joint detection (SDJD) receivers. The unique properties of ultrasonic signals, such as their discrete pulse nature and limited bandwidth, necessitate a distinct analysis approach compared to traditional continuous radio frequency (RF) signals. Theoretical models and simulations are employed to evaluate how imperfect channel estimation affects the BER performance of these receivers, revealing that SDJD consistently outperforms SDSD under similar conditions [21].

Channel capacity analysis in fading environments involves deriving the maximum data rate that can be reliably transmitted over a channel with time-varying characteristics. This is typically achieved by modeling the channel as a random process and deriving expressions for the mutual information between the transmitted and received signals. In the context of ultrasonic communication, the fading behavior is influenced by factors such as multipath propagation, absorption, and the physical properties of the medium. The analysis considers both the time-variant impulse response and frequency response of the channel, leading to the derivation of key parameters such as coherence time, coherence bandwidth, and delay spread [22]. These parameters are essential for designing robust communication systems that can adapt to the dynamic nature of the channel.

The optimal splitting ratios for SDSD and SDJD receivers are determined through detailed analysis, aiming to minimize the BER under varying channel conditions [21]. The results show that while SDJD offers superior performance in terms of BER, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the accuracy of channel estimation [21]. In practical scenarios, where perfect channel estimation is difficult to achieve, the performance of SDSD can degrade significantly. This highlights the importance of developing advanced channel estimation techniques to enhance the reliability of ultrasonic communication systems. The insights gained from this analysis contribute to the design of more resilient and efficient communication protocols for applications in complex and dynamic environments.

# 5 Matrix-Based Signal Analysis and Separation

## 5.1 Signal Decomposition and Filtering

### 5.1.1 Variational modal decomposition with morphological filtering
Variational modal decomposition (VMD) is a powerful signal processing technique that decomposes a complex signal into a set of band-limited intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) through an optimization process [23]. Unlike traditional methods such as empirical mode decomposition (EMD) or wavelet transforms, VMD employs a variational approach to iteratively determine the center frequencies and bandwidths of each IMF, ensuring a more accurate and adaptive decomposition. This method leverages the Hilbert transform and Wiener filtering to extract the dominant frequency components, making it particularly effective for non-stationary and nonlinear signals. The ability of VMD to maintain the integrity of signal features while separating different modes makes it a valuable tool in various applications, including fault diagnosis and biomedical signal analysis.

When combined with morphological filtering, VMD enhances its capability to extract meaningful features from noisy or complex signals. Morphological filtering, based on mathematical morphology, is used to remove noise and preserve the essential structure of the signal. By integrating this filtering technique with VMD, the decomposition process becomes more robust against noise interference, leading to improved signal clarity and interpretability. The morphological filtering step typically involves operations such as dilation and erosion, which help in isolating the relevant components of the signal. This synergy between VMD and morphological filtering results in a more refined and reliable signal decomposition, especially in environments with high levels of noise or interference.

The application of VMD with morphological filtering has shown promising results in various domains, including mechanical systems, biomedical engineering, and geophysical signal processing.

### 5.1.2 Single and multiple scattering separation via SVD
Single and multiple scattering separation via singular value decomposition (SVD) plays a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy of target detection in complex scattering environments. The fundamental idea is to decompose the array response matrix into its singular values and vectors, thereby isolating the contributions of single and multiple scattering [24]. By applying SVD to the matrix, the dominant singular values correspond to the most significant scattering components, which can be associated with the target of interest. However, when multiple scattering is present, the singular values corresponding to the target may be masked or distorted, necessitating a method to separate these contributions [25]. This separation is essential for improving the performance of subsequent processing steps, such as the decomposition of the time reversal operator (DORT), which relies on the accurate identification of the target's scattering signature [25].

The process of separating single and multiple scattering contributions typically involves analyzing the structure of the array response matrix and leveraging properties of its singular values [24]. In particular, the singular values associated with single scattering tend to be more prominent and distinct compared to those arising from multiple scattering, which are often more diffuse and less structured. By applying random matrix theory, it is possible to distinguish between the two types of scattering by examining the statistical properties of the singular values. This approach allows for the extraction of the single-scattering subspace, which can then be used to enhance the resolution and robustness of target detection algorithms [24]. The separation is further refined by focusing on the antidiagonals of the matrix, which contain information about the dominant scattering paths and help in isolating the target's contribution.

Once the single- and multiple-scattering components are separated, the DORT method can be effectively applied to the filtered matrix to detect the target [25]. The detection criterion is based on the magnitude of the first singular value, which indicates the presence of a target. This approach significantly improves the reliability of detection in highly scattering media, where traditional methods may fail due to the interference of multiple scattering. The use of SVD for scattering separation not only enhances the accuracy of target localization but also provides a robust framework for analyzing complex wave propagation scenarios. This technique is particularly valuable in applications such as non-destructive testing, remote sensing, and underwater acoustics, where the presence of multiple scattering can severely degrade the performance of conventional methods.

In the context of array signal processing, fourth-order cumulants are used to enhance resolution and improve the separation of coherent or wideband signals. By leveraging the properties of cumulant-based methods, such as aperture extension and noise suppression, advanced algorithms can achieve higher accuracy in parameter estimation and source localization. This makes fourth-order cumulants particularly valuable in applications where signal clarity and robustness are critical.

Low-rank matrix approximation techniques are often employed to reduce computational complexity while preserving essential signal characteristics. These methods exploit the inherent structure of data matrices, assuming that the underlying signal can be represented with a smaller number of significant components. When combined with fourth-order cumulants, low-rank approximations can mitigate the computational burden associated with high-dimensional data, making real-time processing feasible. This synergy allows for efficient extraction of relevant features, such as arrival times and spatial distributions, which are crucial for tasks like raypath separation and target localization. The integration of these techniques provides a balance between performance and efficiency, enabling practical implementation in complex signal environments.

The combination of fourth-order cumulants and low-rank matrix approximation has been shown to enhance the resolution and robustness of signal processing algorithms [26]. By leveraging the statistical properties of cumulants and the structural simplicity of low-rank models, this approach effectively addresses challenges posed by multiple scattering and noise. The resulting methods offer improved separation of signals in both point-to-array and array-to-array configurations, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional techniques. This integration not only enhances the accuracy of signal analysis but also facilitates the development of more efficient and scalable solutions for a wide range of applications in radar, sonar, and wireless communications.

### 5.2.2 Random matrix theory for defect detection
Random matrix theory (RMT) has emerged as a powerful tool for defect detection in complex systems, particularly in scenarios involving multiple scattering and noisy environments. By analyzing the statistical properties of matrices derived from sensor or signal data, RMT enables the separation of single- and multiple-scattering contributions, which is crucial for identifying hidden targets or defects. This approach leverages the inherent randomness in the scattering process to distinguish between signal and noise, providing a robust framework for detecting anomalies that might otherwise be obscured by interference. The application of RMT in this context is especially valuable when dealing with unknown or heterogeneous media, where traditional methods may fail due to the complexity of the wave interactions.

The use of RMT in defect detection involves the analysis of singular values and eigenvectors of the response matrix, which can reveal the presence of a target by examining the dominant singular values. When applied to the filtered matrix, RMT allows for the identification of the first singular value, which is often associated with the presence of a defect or hidden object. This technique is particularly effective in weakly scattering media, where the distinction between single and multiple scattering is critical [24]. By utilizing the statistical behavior of the matrix, RMT provides a reliable criterion for detecting targets, even in the presence of non-uniform noise or complex scattering environments.

Furthermore, RMT offers a theoretical foundation for understanding the underlying structure of the scattering process, enabling the extraction of meaningful information from the data. This is achieved by characterizing the microarchitecture of the medium through parameters such as the elastic mean-free path and the diffusion constant. These parameters, derived from the random walk analogy of multiple scattering, provide insights into the physical properties of the medium, which can be used to enhance the accuracy of defect detection. Overall, RMT provides a versatile and mathematically rigorous approach for detecting defects in a wide range of applications, from non-destructive testing to remote sensing and beyond.

## 5.3 Target Detection and Analysis

### 5.3.1 DORT method for multiple scattering suppression
The DORT (Decomposition of the Time Reversed Operator) method is a powerful technique for suppressing multiple scattering effects in imaging and detection applications. It operates by decomposing the response matrix of a wavefield into singular values and vectors, allowing for the isolation of contributions from individual scatterers. By applying DORT to a filtered matrix that has been processed to remove multiple scattering components, the method can effectively detect targets even in complex environments where multiple scattering is prevalent [25]. The key to this approach lies in the identification of the dominant singular value, which is used as a detection criterion to determine the presence of a target. This capability makes DORT particularly useful in scenarios where traditional imaging techniques fail due to the overwhelming influence of multiple scattering [24].

In cases where a target is hidden behind a strongly scattering medium, the direct application of DORT to the raw response matrix may not yield accurate results [25]. This is because multiple scattering can distort the singular value distribution, making it difficult to associate the first singular value with the actual target [25]. To address this issue, the method involves a preprocessing step that separates single- and multiple-scattering contributions from the total response [24]. This separation is based on the properties of the response matrix and allows for a more accurate identification of the target's position and characteristics. The effectiveness of DORT in such scenarios has been demonstrated through various experimental and numerical studies, highlighting its robustness in challenging environments.

The DORT method's ability to isolate and suppress multiple scattering effects has significant implications for the development of advanced imaging and detection systems. By enabling the accurate identification of targets in the presence of strong scattering, it enhances the reliability and performance of these systems in real-world applications. Furthermore, the method's adaptability to different configurations and its compatibility with various signal processing techniques make it a versatile tool for a wide range of applications. As research continues to refine and expand the capabilities of DORT, its role in overcoming the limitations of traditional imaging methods is expected to grow, offering new possibilities for improved detection and analysis in complex media.

### 5.3.2 Single scattering filter for target identification
The single scattering filter (SSF) plays a critical role in target identification by isolating the deterministic coherence of single-scattered signals from the complex wavefield [25]. This coherence manifests along the antidiagonals of the array response matrix, enabling the extraction of single-scattered waves even in the presence of dominant multiple scattering [25]. By leveraging this unique property, the SSF effectively filters out the noise and interference caused by multiple scattering, thereby improving the accuracy of target detection. The filtered matrix, denoted as $\mathbf{K}^{\mathbf{F}}$, allows for the application of advanced techniques such as DORT (Decomposition of the Time Reversal Operator), which can identify and localize targets with greater precision despite the challenging scattering environment.

In scenarios where multiple scattering dominates, direct application of conventional methods like DORT to the original array response matrix $\mathbf{K}$ often fails due to the distortion caused by scattered waves [25]. The SSF addresses this limitation by separating the single- and multiple-scattering contributions, ensuring that the target signature is preserved in the filtered matrix. This separation is crucial for enhancing the robustness of target detection algorithms, particularly in environments with strong scattering media [24]. The SSF not only improves the reliability of detection but also provides insights into the scattering characteristics of the medium, which can be used to validate or refine existing imaging models.

The effectiveness of the SSF is further demonstrated through its ability to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and improve the resolution of target identification. By focusing on the deterministic structure of single-scattered waves, the SSF enables more accurate estimation of the first singular value $\lambda_1$, which serves as a detection criterion. This approach is particularly beneficial in applications where high-resolution imaging is required, such as in non-destructive testing or medical imaging. Overall, the SSF represents a significant advancement in the field of target identification, offering a reliable and efficient method for dealing with complex scattering environments.

## 5.4 Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition

### 5.4.1 Shapelet Transform for wind event detection
The shapelet transform is a powerful technique for extracting discriminative temporal patterns from time series data, making it particularly suitable for wind event detection [27]. This method decomposes time series into a set of shapelets—short, discriminative subsequences that capture the essential characteristics of the underlying events. In the context of wind event detection, shapelets can effectively identify distinct patterns in wind speed and direction data, such as sudden gusts or prolonged high-wind conditions. By focusing on these localized features, the shapelet transform enables the detection of anomalies and extreme weather events with high precision, even in noisy or complex environments. The approach is computationally efficient and offers a balance between interpretability and performance, making it a valuable tool for real-time monitoring applications.

The application of the shapelet transform to wind event detection involves several key stages, including data preprocessing, shapelet extraction, and classification. Initially, raw wind velocity data is preprocessed to remove noise and normalize the signal, ensuring that the extracted shapelets are representative of actual wind patterns. Subsequently, shapelets are identified through an optimization process that maximizes their discriminative power between different wind event classes. These shapelets are then used as features for training machine learning models, which can classify new data based on the presence of these patterns. The effectiveness of this approach is enhanced by the ability of shapelets to capture both local and global characteristics of wind events, leading to improved detection accuracy.

In the context of the "Wind and Ports" (WP) and "Wind, Ports and Sea" (WPS) projects, the shapelet transform has been employed to detect extreme wind events in port areas [27]. By analyzing wind speed measurements over time, the transform identifies recurring patterns that correspond to specific types of wind events, such as thunderstorms or sudden wind shifts. This enables the early detection of hazardous conditions, supporting safer operations in port environments. The method's adaptability to varying data distributions and its capacity to handle non-stationary signals make it a robust solution for wind event detection. Overall, the shapelet transform provides a structured and effective framework for analyzing wind data, contributing to more accurate and reliable event detection [27].

### 5.4.2 Time series analysis for thunderstorm classification
Time series analysis plays a critical role in thunderstorm classification by enabling the extraction of meaningful patterns from sequential meteorological data. Traditional methods often rely on statistical features or manual observations, which can be limited in capturing the dynamic and complex nature of thunderstorm events. Recent advancements have introduced machine learning techniques that leverage time series representations to improve classification accuracy. Among these, the Shapelet Transform has emerged as a powerful approach, capable of identifying discriminative subsequences within time series data that are indicative of specific weather phenomena. This method focuses on the shape of the data rather than its raw values, making it particularly effective for detecting abrupt changes and recurring patterns associated with thunderstorms.

The application of the Shapelet Transform in thunderstorm classification involves preprocessing anemometric records and other meteorological time series to extract relevant features [27]. These features are then used to train machine learning models that can distinguish between thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm events. The effectiveness of this approach is enhanced by its ability to generalize across different weather conditions and data sources. By focusing on the temporal structure of the data, the Shapelet Transform allows for the identification of subtle yet significant patterns that may be missed by conventional methods. This makes it a valuable tool for automated thunderstorm detection and analysis, especially in environments where manual observation is impractical or insufficient.

In addition to the Shapelet Transform, other time series analysis techniques such as Fourier transforms, wavelet transforms, and autoregressive models have been explored for thunderstorm classification [27]. These methods offer complementary insights by capturing different aspects of the temporal data, such as frequency components, time-frequency localization, and predictive trends. However, the Shapelet Transform stands out for its interpretability and efficiency in capturing the unique temporal signatures of thunderstorms [27]. As the field continues to evolve, integrating advanced time series analysis techniques with machine learning models is expected to further enhance the accuracy and reliability of thunderstorm classification systems.

## 5.5 Image and Object Detection

### 5.5.1 Polygon-shaped representation for parking slot detection
The section on polygon-shaped representation for parking slot detection introduces a novel approach that effectively models parking slots of various orientations, including parallel, perpendicular, and diagonal configurations [28]. This representation is designed to capture the geometric complexity of parking slots, even when partially occluded, by leveraging a polygonal structure that can adapt to different slot shapes. The method enables the modeling of both fully visible and partially hidden slots, which is a critical challenge in real-world parking detection scenarios. By using a polygon-based framework, the system can accurately represent the boundaries of parking slots, facilitating more precise detection and localization.

A key component of this approach is the introduction of a novel regression loss function called polygon-corner GIoU, which is specifically designed for optimizing the positions of polygon corners. This loss function enhances the accuracy of corner detection by incorporating geometric consistency and spatial relationships between corners, leading to more robust and precise slot boundary estimation. The polygon-corner GIoU loss is integrated into an end-to-end learning framework, allowing the model to directly learn the optimal polygon representation from raw image data. This approach not only improves detection performance but also simplifies the overall detection pipeline by eliminating the need for separate corner detection and boundary fitting stages.

The polygon-shaped representation is implemented within a custom neural network architecture that processes top-view images generated from camera inputs. The model is trained on a dataset specifically curated for parking slot detection, ensuring that it can generalize across different parking environments and lighting conditions [28]. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in detecting parking slots under challenging conditions, such as occlusions and varying angles. This representation provides a flexible and scalable solution for real-time parking slot detection systems, making it suitable for deployment in autonomous vehicles and intelligent parking assistance systems [28].

### 5.5.2 Custom dataset and GIoU loss for image-based detection
The section on "Custom dataset and GIoU loss for image-based detection" presents the development of a specialized dataset tailored for camera-only parking slot detection [28]. This dataset includes a diverse range of parking slot configurations, covering parallel, perpendicular, and diagonal orientations, ensuring comprehensive coverage of real-world scenarios. The dataset is annotated with polygon-shaped representations that accurately capture the geometry of parking slots, including both fully visible and occluded cases [28]. This annotation approach facilitates end-to-end learning by providing precise geometric supervision, which is essential for training robust detection models. The dataset is collected from various real-world environments, ensuring variability in lighting, weather, and camera angles, which enhances the generalization capability of the proposed method.

A key contribution of this section is the introduction of the polygon-corner GIoU loss function, designed to optimize the positioning of polygon corners in the detection process. Traditional loss functions, such as standard GIoU, may not effectively capture the geometric nuances of polygonal shapes, leading to suboptimal corner localization. The polygon-corner GIoU loss addresses this by incorporating the relative positions of polygon corners, thereby improving the accuracy of the detected slot boundaries. This loss function is particularly effective in handling occluded or partially visible slots, where precise corner detection is critical for accurate slot estimation. The integration of this loss into the neural network training process significantly enhances the model's ability to learn and predict polygonal structures with high precision.

The combination of the custom dataset and the polygon-corner GIoU loss leads to improved performance in image-based parking slot detection [28]. The dataset provides a rich and varied set of training examples, while the loss function ensures that the model learns to accurately predict the geometric structure of parking slots. This synergy results in a detection system that is both robust and accurate, capable of operating effectively in complex and dynamic environments. The experimental results presented in the subsequent sections validate the effectiveness of this approach, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment in autonomous parking systems.
