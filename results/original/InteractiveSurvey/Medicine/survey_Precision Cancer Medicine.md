Unlike traditional U-Net-based diffusion models, vision-guided diffusion models emphasize global contextual reasoning, which is essential for handling the variability and complexity of tumor morphology [12]. The diffusion process, guided by the vision transformer, progressively refines the segmentation, reducing voxel-level errors and improving boundary precision [12]. This approach is particularly beneficial in challenging scenarios, such as tumor-bearing brains, where the presence of heterogeneous tissue and variable contrast uptake can obscure tumor boundaries. By incorporating attention mechanisms, these models dynamically focus on the most relevant regions, enhancing the robustness of the segmentation process.

The application of vision-guided diffusion models in tumor segmentation has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making. These models not only enhance the precision of tumor delineation but also provide a more interpretable framework for understanding the underlying features driving the segmentation. As the availability of multimodal medical data continues to grow, the development of such models will play a crucial role in advancing personalized medicine and improving patient outcomes. Their ability to integrate diverse data sources while maintaining high performance makes them a promising direction for future research in medical image analysis.

### 5.3.2 3D U-Net with attention for cerebrovascular imaging
The 3D U-Net architecture has emerged as a powerful tool for medical image segmentation, particularly in cerebrovascular imaging where precise delineation of complex anatomical structures is critical [13]. By extending the original U-Net design to three dimensions, this architecture effectively captures spatial relationships across volumetric data, enabling accurate segmentation of cerebral vessels and surrounding tissues [13]. The integration of attention mechanisms further enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant regions, improving performance in the presence of noisy or heterogeneous data. This combination of 3D spatial modeling and attention-based feature selection addresses key challenges in cerebrovascular segmentation, such as variable vessel morphology and low contrast between structures.

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in enhancing the performance of 3D U-Net models for cerebrovascular imaging. These mechanisms allow the network to dynamically allocate computational resources to the most informative regions, thereby improving segmentation accuracy and reducing false positives. For example, attention modules have been incorporated to emphasize vessel boundaries and suppress irrelevant background information, leading to more reliable segmentation results. Additionally, the use of multi-scale feature extraction and residual connections further strengthens the model's capacity to capture both local and global contextual information, which is essential for accurate vessel segmentation in complex anatomical environments.

The application of 3D U-Net with attention in cerebrovascular imaging has shown promising results in both clinical and research settings. By leveraging the strengths of 3D convolutional operations and attention-based feature weighting, these models achieve high Dice similarity coefficients and robust performance across diverse datasets. Furthermore, their ability to generalize across different imaging modalities and patient populations makes them valuable tools for automated cerebrovascular analysis. As the demand for accurate and efficient segmentation methods continues to grow, the integration of attention mechanisms into 3D U-Net architectures represents a significant advancement in the field of medical image analysis.
