# 5 Causal and Dynamic Modeling in Complex Systems

## 5.1 Dynamic Systems and Causal Inference

### 5.1.1 Non-stationary modeling for financial and social systems
Non-stationary modeling has emerged as a critical approach for capturing the dynamic and evolving nature of financial and social systems. Unlike traditional stationary models, which assume constant statistical properties over time, non-stationary models account for shifts in underlying patterns, making them more suitable for systems characterized by volatility and structural changes. In financial contexts, this is particularly relevant for modeling asset prices, market risks, and macroeconomic indicators that are influenced by external shocks, policy changes, and evolving investor behaviors. Similarly, in social systems, non-stationary models can better represent trends in income distribution, social mobility, and demographic shifts, which are inherently time-varying. The integration of non-stationary techniques allows for more accurate predictions and robust decision-making in environments where stability is rare.

Recent advancements in non-stationary modeling have leveraged methods from time-series analysis, such as dynamic factor models and state-space representations, to capture evolving relationships between variables [5]. These models are particularly useful in scenarios where traditional stationary assumptions fail, such as during financial crises or periods of rapid social change. For instance, in the context of wealth distribution, non-stationary models can reveal how economic disparities evolve over time, offering insights into the mechanisms driving inequality. Additionally, these models can be enhanced with causal inference techniques to distinguish between genuine relationships and spurious correlations, improving the reliability of predictions in complex systems. The ability to adapt to changing dynamics is essential for both financial forecasting and social policy design, where static models may lead to misleading conclusions.

The application of non-stationary modeling extends beyond theoretical frameworks to practical implementations in real-world systems. In finance, it has been used to improve risk assessment and portfolio management by incorporating time-varying volatility and correlation structures. In social systems, it has been applied to analyze longitudinal data on education, health, and labor markets, enabling more nuanced policy interventions. However, the complexity of non-stationary models also presents challenges, including increased computational demands and the need for robust validation strategies.

Causal reasoning has emerged as a critical tool for enhancing fairness-aware diagnosis in both educational and health contexts by addressing the complex interplay between sensitive attributes and outcome variables [6]. Traditional diagnostic models often inherit biases from historical data, where spurious correlations between sensitive attributes and outcomes can lead to unfair decisions. By integrating causal inference, these models can distinguish between genuine causal relationships and confounding factors, enabling the elimination of biased pathways while preserving meaningful information. This approach is particularly valuable in educational settings, where factors such as family background or socioeconomic status may erroneously influence student performance assessments, and in healthcare, where similar biases can affect diagnostic accuracy and treatment recommendations.

The Path-Specific Causal Reasoning Framework (PSCRF) represents a significant advancement in this area by leveraging causal graphs to model the relationships between variables and identify path-specific effects. This framework allows for the isolation of direct and indirect causal influences, ensuring that sensitive attributes do not unduly affect diagnostic outcomes. In educational diagnosis, for instance, the quality of the learning environment can be appropriately weighted while excluding the influence of family wealth. Similarly, in healthcare, causal reasoning can help disentangle the effects of genetic predispositions from environmental factors, leading to more equitable and accurate diagnoses. The application of such frameworks not only enhances fairness but also improves the interpretability and reliability of diagnostic models.

The integration of causal reasoning into fairness-aware diagnosis also necessitates the development of robust evaluation metrics and data preprocessing techniques that account for causal structures [6]. This includes the use of causal subset filtering, where data is curated based on identified causal relationships, and the implementation of calibration processes that adapt models to individual characteristics. These methods ensure that diagnostic models remain effective while minimizing the risk of perpetuating systemic biases. As the field continues to evolve, further research is needed to refine these approaches and apply them across diverse domains, ultimately contributing to more just and equitable decision-making systems in education and healthcare.

Recurrence analysis, particularly through techniques such as recurrence plots and recurrence quantification analysis, allows for the visualization and quantification of system states over time, offering insights into the predictability and stability of dynamic systems. These approaches are especially valuable in systems where small perturbations can lead to significant changes in behavior, such as in physiological or ecological systems.

In physical systems, chaos theory and recurrence analysis have been instrumental in characterizing turbulent flows, mechanical vibrations, and signal processing in engineering applications. The ability to detect and quantify determinism in noisy or irregular signals has led to advancements in fault detection, system identification, and predictive modeling. For instance, in biomechanics, these techniques have been used to analyze muscle vibrations and postural control, uncovering subtle changes in system behavior that may indicate underlying pathologies or performance variations. By reconstructing the state space of a system using time-delay embeddings, researchers can extract meaningful features that reflect the system's inherent dynamics. This has proven particularly useful in scenarios where traditional statistical methods fail to capture the complexity of the system's behavior.

The integration of chaos theory and recurrence analysis into the study of biological and physical systems has opened new avenues for interdisciplinary research. These methods enable a deeper understanding of the non-linear interactions that govern complex systems, offering a more comprehensive view of their behavior over time. As computational power and data acquisition techniques continue to advance, the application of these analytical tools is expected to expand, leading to more accurate models and improved predictive capabilities. This growing body of work underscores the importance of chaos theory and recurrence analysis in advancing our understanding of dynamic systems across multiple scientific domains.

These protocols simulate an intelligent agent by having a human operator control the system's responses, allowing researchers to study human behavior in a controlled yet naturalistic environment. This approach is especially valuable in affective computing, where the accurate recognition and interpretation of emotional states are crucial. By leveraging WoZ, researchers can gather rich, multimodal data that reflects authentic human interactions, which is essential for training and validating affective models. The flexibility of WoZ protocols also enables the exploration of complex behavioral dynamics, making them a powerful tool for understanding how individuals respond to various stimuli and interventions.

In the context of behavioral studies, WoZ protocols facilitate the investigation of human-robot interaction (HRI) and the development of adaptive systems that respond to user emotions and actions [8]. These protocols allow for the systematic manipulation of variables such as verbal and non-verbal cues, enabling researchers to dissect the causal relationships between human behaviors and system responses. This is particularly important in settings like healthcare and education, where the ability of an agent to recognize and adapt to a user's emotional state can significantly impact the effectiveness of the interaction. Additionally, WoZ protocols are instrumental in creating annotated datasets that capture the nuances of affective expressions, which are vital for training machine learning models. By simulating real-world interactions, these protocols help bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical applications.

The application of WoZ protocols in affective and behavioral studies also highlights their role in addressing challenges related to data quality and bias. By involving human operators in the interaction process, researchers can ensure that the data collected is representative of real-world scenarios, thereby improving the generalizability of findings.

### 5.3.2 Causality-based adaptation in robotic and human-computer interaction
Causality-based adaptation in robotic and human-computer interaction (HRI) represents a significant advancement in enabling systems to understand and respond to complex, dynamic interactions [8]. By integrating causal inference, these systems can move beyond surface-level correlations and instead model the underlying mechanisms that govern human and robotic behaviors. This approach allows for more robust and interpretable decision-making, particularly in scenarios where traditional statistical methods may fail due to confounding variables or spurious associations. Causal reasoning provides a framework for identifying the direct effects of interventions, which is crucial for designing adaptive systems that can generalize across diverse user interactions and environments.

Recent studies have explored the application of causal inference in HRI, focusing on how human behaviors and robotic actions influence each other in real-world settings [8]. These efforts aim to uncover the causal interplay that underlies successful interactions, enabling robots to adapt more effectively to user needs and contextual changes. By leveraging causal graphs and path-specific reasoning, researchers have developed models that can disentangle the effects of various factors, such as user expressions or environmental conditions, on interaction outcomes. This not only enhances the explainability of robotic decisions but also improves the system's ability to maintain fairness and avoid biased responses, particularly in sensitive applications like healthcare or education.

The integration of causality into adaptive models has also shown promise in addressing challenges related to individual differences and dynamic environments. Techniques such as path-specific causal reasoning allow systems to filter out irrelevant or biased influences while preserving meaningful relationships. This is particularly valuable in scenarios where user attributes, such as age or physiological characteristics, can affect interaction outcomes. By incorporating causal inference, HRI systems can achieve more personalized and effective adaptations, leading to improved user experiences and more reliable performance over time. These advancements highlight the potential of causality-based methods to transform the way robots and humans interact in complex, real-world settings [8].

# 6 Future Directions


Despite significant advancements in the integration of computational tools and psychological theories in education and behavior change, several limitations persist in current research. Many existing studies rely on static models that fail to account for the dynamic and evolving nature of learning environments. Additionally, the generalizability of findings is often constrained by the specific contexts in which they are tested, limiting their applicability to broader educational or behavioral scenarios. Furthermore, the ethical implications of AI-driven interventions, such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for over-reliance on automated systems, remain underexplored. These gaps highlight the need for more comprehensive and context-aware approaches that address the complexities of real-world applications.

Future research should prioritize the development of more robust and adaptive models that can capture the non-stationary and causal dynamics of learning and behavior. This includes advancing causal inference techniques to better understand the mechanisms underlying learning outcomes and behavior change. Additionally, there is a need to explore the integration of multimodal data sources, such as physiological signals, natural language, and behavioral patterns, to create more holistic and personalized learning systems. Research should also focus on improving the interpretability and fairness of AI-driven educational tools, ensuring that they align with ethical principles and promote equitable access. Furthermore, the exploration of hybrid models that combine reinforcement learning, cognitive theories, and human-in-the-loop systems could lead to more effective and adaptive interventions that better support diverse learner needs.

The proposed future work has the potential to significantly advance the field of educational technology and behavior change by addressing critical limitations and expanding the scope of existing methodologies. By developing more accurate and interpretable models, researchers can enhance the effectiveness of adaptive learning systems and improve the personalization of educational experiences. Additionally, the integration of ethical and fairness-aware approaches will ensure that AI-driven interventions are not only technically sound but also socially responsible. These advancements can lead to more equitable and sustainable educational practices, ultimately contributing to improved learning outcomes and long-term behavior change. Moreover, the development of more robust and context-sensitive models will enable the broader application of these technologies across diverse domains, fostering innovation and enhancing the overall impact of computational and psychological approaches in education and beyond.
