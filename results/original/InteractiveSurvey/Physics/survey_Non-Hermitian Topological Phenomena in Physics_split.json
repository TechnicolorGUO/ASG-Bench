      "content": "The study of non-Hermitian topological phenomena has emerged as a transformative area in modern physics, offering novel insights into the interplay between topology, non-Hermiticity, and symmetry [1]. Traditionally, topological physics has been grounded in the framework of Hermitian Hamiltonians, where the conservation of probability and the unitary evolution of quantum states ensure well-defined topological invariants [2]. However, the realization that non-Hermitian systems—those with complex eigenvalues and non-unitary dynamics—can host robust topological phases has broadened the scope of topological research [2]. These systems, often characterized by gain and loss, open quantum systems, or synthetic gauge fields, exhibit unique features such as non-Hermitian skin effects, exceptional points, and hybrid topological-skin states [3]. This growing interest is driven by both fundamental theoretical curiosity and the potential for technological applications in photonics, electronics, and quantum information processing.\n\nThis survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of non-Hermitian topological phenomena, focusing on both theoretical and experimental advancements [4]. It explores the unification of topological classifications through mathematical frameworks such as singular value decomposition (SVD), the role of Floquet modulation in engineering synthetic gauge fluxes, and the breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems. Additionally, it examines the skin effect localization and its implications for topological phase transitions, as well as the experimental realization of non-Hermitian topological systems in photonic and quantum optical platforms [5].

      "content": "The singular value decomposition (SVD) offers a powerful mathematical framework for unifying topological classifications across diverse physical systems. By decomposing a complex Hamiltonian into its singular values and vectors, SVD enables the extraction of essential topological features while discarding redundant information. This process facilitates a systematic analysis of the band structure and associated topological invariants, allowing for a more generalized understanding of topological phases [1]. The method effectively maps the original system onto a simplified yet self-contained representation, preserving critical topological properties through renormalized parameters. This approach is particularly advantageous in non-Hermitian and nonlocal systems, where conventional methods often fail to capture the full complexity of the topological landscape [8].\n\nThe application of SVD in topological classification extends beyond traditional Hermitian systems, providing a robust tool for analyzing non-Hermitian and PT-symmetric settings. In such systems, the interplay between nonlocality, non-Hermiticity, and topology introduces new challenges in defining and computing topological invariants [4]. The SVD-based framework addresses these challenges by enabling the identification of point-gap and line-gap topological invariants, which are essential for characterizing the robustness of edge and bulk states. Furthermore, the decomposition allows for the distinction between different topological phases, even in the presence of complex spectral structures. This capability is crucial for understanding the emergence of novel topological phenomena, such as the nontrivial worldline winding and the coexistence of topological and skin modes.\n\nBy leveraging the SVD, the unification of topological classifications becomes more transparent and systematic, bridging the gap between different physical platforms and theoretical models. The method's ability to handle multi-band and multi-dimensional systems makes it a versatile tool for exploring the interplay between Hermitian and non-Hermitian topologies [8]. It also facilitates the study of hybrid topological-skin effects, where the coexistence of topological and non-Hermitian behaviors leads to rich and novel physical phenomena [9]. Ultimately, the SVD-based approach provides a foundational framework for advancing the understanding of topological systems in both conventional and non-standard settings."

      "content": "Floquet modulation provides a powerful framework for engineering synthetic gauge fluxes in periodically driven systems, enabling the realization of non-trivial topological phases and exotic wave phenomena [9]. By introducing time-periodic perturbations, Floquet engineering allows the creation of effective Hamiltonians that mimic the behavior of static systems with synthetic magnetic fields or other gauge potentials [9]. This approach has been instrumental in generating topological edge states, non-Abelian gauge fields, and hybrid topological-skin effects. The periodic driving introduces artificial gauge fluxes that can be tuned to control the propagation and localization of waves, offering a flexible platform for exploring novel topological and non-Hermitian phenomena beyond conventional solid-state systems.\n\nThe interplay between Floquet modulation and synthetic gauge flux engineering is particularly significant in the context of non-Hermitian systems, where the introduction of gain and loss can lead to unique spectral and transport properties. Time-periodic driving enables the realization of complex band structures, including point gaps and line gaps, which support robust edge states and non-reciprocal wave propagation. These effects are not only relevant in photonic and phononic systems but also extend to cold atom setups and electronic circuits. By modulating the system periodically, one can engineer the effective Hamiltonian to exhibit desired topological properties, such as chiral edge modes or topological transitions, while simultaneously introducing non-Hermitian features like exceptional points and skin effects.\n\nFurthermore, Floquet modulation facilitates the exploration of dynamic wave localization and complex wave interactions, which are crucial for understanding the behavior of waves in structured media. The combination of synthetic gauge fluxes with time-dependent driving allows for the control of wave dynamics at the interface between different media, leading to enhanced surface wave localization and directional amplification. This approach opens new avenues for designing photonic and acoustic devices with tailored topological properties, enabling applications in robust waveguiding, lasing, and sensing. The ability to engineer synthetic gauge fluxes through Floquet modulation thus represents a key strategy for realizing and controlling topological and non-Hermitian wave phenomena in a wide range of physical systems [9]."

      "content": "The bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems presents a fundamentally different behavior compared to its Hermitian counterpart, primarily due to the presence of non-Hermitian skin effects and the emergence of exceptional points [10]. In conventional Hermitian systems, the correspondence links the topological invariants of the bulk to the existence of robust edge states [1]. However, in non-Hermitian systems, the breakdown of this correspondence is often observed, as the eigenstates tend to localize at the boundaries rather than being distributed throughout the bulk [8]. This deviation is attributed to the non-Bloch band theory, which introduces the concept of a generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) to account for the complex eigenvalue spectra [5]. The GBZ allows for a more accurate description of the bulk properties and their relationship to the edge states, thereby providing a framework to understand the topological nature of non-Hermitian systems.\n\nThe interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology leads to the emergence of novel topological phases, where the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence is either modified or entirely absent [1]. In particular, the non-Hermitian skin effect causes all eigenstates to accumulate at the system boundaries, which fundamentally alters the nature of the edge states [8]. This effect is closely related to the point-gap topology of the Hamiltonian, where the winding number of the energy spectrum under periodic boundary conditions determines the presence of the skin effect. As a result, the traditional notion of topological protection is redefined, with the robustness of edge states now depending on the interplay between the non-Hermitian parameters and the topological invariants. This has significant implications for the design of topological devices, as the presence of non-Hermitian effects can lead to unique transport properties and enhanced sensitivity [11].\n\nRecent advances in non-Bloch band theory and transfer matrix approaches have enabled a more systematic analysis of the bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems [7]. These methods reveal that while the conventional correspondence breaks down, a generalized form can still be established by considering the complex energy spectrum and the associated GBZ. This generalized correspondence provides a way to predict the existence of edge states based on the topological properties of the bulk, even in the presence of non-Hermitian effects. Furthermore, the study of non-Hermitian systems has uncovered new phenomena, such as hybrid topological-skin effects and the coexistence of skin modes with topological edge states, which expand the scope of topological physics beyond the traditional Hermitian framework [9]. These findings highlight the rich and complex behavior of non-Hermitian systems and their potential for novel applications in quantum and classical technologies [9]."

      "level": 3,
      "content": "The skin effect localization in non-Hermitian systems is a hallmark phenomenon characterized by the exponential concentration of eigenstates at the boundaries under open boundary conditions [8]. This effect fundamentally alters the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence, leading to a breakdown of the Bloch band theory and introducing new topological invariants [12]. In the context of topological phase transitions, the interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology gives rise to distinct phases that can be classified by the closing of point or line gaps in the complex energy spectrum [1]. These transitions are often accompanied by the emergence of exceptional points, where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, further enriching the phase diagram. The localization of bulk states at the edges not only affects the transport properties but also influences the stability and robustness of topological modes against perturbations.\n\nTopological phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems are closely tied to the spectral topology of the Hamiltonian, which is governed by the winding number around reference points in the complex plane [1]. This winding number determines the presence or absence of the non-Hermitian skin effect and reflects the generalized bulk-boundary correspondence. The transition between trivial and nontrivial topological phases is marked by the closing of the spectral gap, which can occur either at a point or along a line in the complex plane. These transitions are highly sensitive to boundary conditions and can lead to the emergence of novel surface states with unique properties. The presence of non-Hermitian terms, such as gain and loss, further complicates the phase diagram, introducing new mechanisms for controlling the localization and propagation of waves.\n\nThe study of skin effect localization and topological phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems has profound implications for both fundamental physics and practical applications [5]. The robustness of topological edge states against disorder and environmental perturbations makes them attractive for designing stable and efficient photonic and electronic devices. Moreover, the interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology offers new avenues for controlling wave propagation, enhancing sensing capabilities, and realizing novel quantum phenomena [4]. As research in this area continues to evolve, a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms and their experimental realizations will be essential for advancing the field of non-Hermitian topological physics [1]."

The topological nature of these systems ensures that certain physical quantities, such as the phase or frequency of a signal, can be measured with high precision despite the presence of noise or disorder. This is particularly relevant in quantum sensing, where the ability to detect minute changes in environmental parameters is crucial. The non-Hermitian topological framework enables the design of sensors that are inherently resilient to perturbations, making them promising candidates for practical applications in quantum metrology and beyond.\n\nThe emergence of non-Hermitian topological phases has led to the development of new sensing mechanisms that exploit the breakdown of conventional bulk-boundary correspondence and the non-Hermitian skin effect [10]. These effects allow for the localization of states at system boundaries, which can be harnessed to detect changes in the system's parameters with high fidelity. In particular, the presence of exceptional points—where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce—provides a unique platform for enhancing the sensitivity of measurements.

This framework enables the exploration of unconventional optical behaviors, including unidirectional waveguiding and robust topological states, which are crucial for next-generation photonic devices [14].\n\nThe challenge of noise immunity in non-Hermitian quantum optical systems is particularly critical, as the inherent asymmetry and non-unitary evolution can amplify external perturbations.

This is achieved through the spatial localization of noise and the preservation of quantum coherence in designated subregions, even under significant input fluctuations. Such strategies leverage the unique properties of non-Hermitian systems to enhance stability and reliability, making them promising candidates for practical applications in quantum communication and precision sensing.\n\nFurthermore, the integration of non-Hermitian principles with topological protection offers a pathway to achieve robustness against disorder and decoherence.

These arcs are characterized by their unique dispersion relations, which connect bulk states in a manner distinct from conventional topological insulators. In systems where gain and loss modulation is applied, the interplay between extended and localized modes leads to the emergence of bulk Fermi arcs, which are observed in both numerical simulations and experimental setups. The presence of these arcs is strongly influenced by the system's dimensionality, with their visibility and stability depending on the spatial configuration and boundary conditions. This connection between Fermi arcs and the underlying geometry of the system is crucial for understanding the topological properties of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.\n\nResonator dimension analysis plays a pivotal role in determining the manifestation of bulk Fermi arcs within a given system. The size and shape of the resonator affect the spatial distribution of the modes, influencing the extent to which Fermi arcs can be observed. In particular, compact resonators with high symmetry can support well-defined bulk states that exhibit Fermi arc characteristics, especially under conditions where the system operates near criticality. The interplay between the resonator's dimensions and the quasiperiodic modulation leads to a rich phase diagram, where the transition between extended and localized states becomes evident.

These lines are fundamentally different from exceptional points, as they form extended structures rather than isolated singularities. In the context of topological edge modes, exceptional lines can give rise to robust boundary states that are protected by the non-Hermitian topology of the bulk. Unlike Hermitian systems, where edge modes are typically associated with a gap in the bulk spectrum, non-Hermitian systems can host edge modes even in the absence of a conventional band gap, due to the interplay between gain and loss and the underlying topological structure [9]. This leads to a rich variety of phenomena, including the emergence of Fermi arc-like modes and the formation of complex spectral structures.\n\nThe presence of exceptional lines significantly influences the behavior of topological edge modes, often leading to their localization at the boundaries of the system. These edge modes can exhibit unique properties such as unidirectional propagation, enhanced sensitivity to perturbations, and non-reciprocal transport, which are not observed in Hermitian systems [9]. The interplay between the exceptional lines and the topological invariants of the system can result in the formation of protected edge states that are resilient to certain types of disorder and perturbations. Furthermore, the presence of exceptional lines can induce critical behavior in the bulk modes, leading to the emergence of phase transitions and critical phenomena that are distinct from those in Hermitian systems.

The interplay between nonlinearity and the inherent asymmetry of the HN model gives rise to novel phenomena, including the formation of stable solitons and the emergence of complex wave patterns. These effects are critical for understanding how non-Hermitian systems respond to external perturbations and how nonlinearities can modify the topological properties of the system [9].\n\nModulational instability in the nonlinear HN model refers to the spontaneous growth of small perturbations in a plane wave, leading to the formation of localized structures. This instability is influenced by the asymmetric gain and loss distribution, which can either enhance or suppress the growth of modulations depending on the system parameters. In the presence of nonlinearity, the instability can lead to the formation of self-trapped states or the onset of chaotic dynamics. The study of this phenomenon provides insights into how non-Hermitian systems can exhibit robustness against disorder and how nonlinear effects can be harnessed for controlled energy localization.\n\nRecent investigations have revealed a unique dynamical feature known as growth blockade, where the intensity growth of modulated waves is abruptly halted despite the presence of modulational instability [6]. This phenomenon, observed in both linear and nonlinear HN models, suggests a complex interplay between nonlinearity, asymmetry, and wave interactions.

In such systems, convection-driven diffusion processes can emulate the behavior of wave systems with non-Hermitian characteristics, enabling the realization of topological edge modes and bulk Fermi arcs [15]. By introducing modulated imaginary onsite potentials and leveraging periodic or quasiperiodic control of transport parameters, it becomes possible to engineer topological phase transitions and critical behavior in plasma and thermal diffusion.

These EPs are associated with bulk Fermi arcs that connect different regions of the Brillouin zone, providing a pathway for robust transport along the system's boundaries. The manipulation of such topological structures through convection and diffusion allows for the design of materials with tunable transport properties, where the interplay between hydrodynamics, elasticity, and non-Hermitian effects can be harnessed to control the flow of particles or energy.

These heterostructures, composed of atomically thin layers with weak interlayer coupling, offer a versatile platform to engineer non-Hermitian Hamiltonians through controlled gain and loss mechanisms. The presence of non-Hermitian terms, such as complex potentials or asymmetric couplings, can lead to the emergence of topological edge states that are robust against certain perturbations, yet exhibit distinct behaviors compared to their Hermitian counterparts [2]. This opens new avenues for exploring non-Hermitian topological phases in two-dimensional systems [1].\n\nRecent studies have demonstrated that non-Hermitian topology in van der Waals heterostructures can be realized through quasiperiodic lattices, such as the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) model, which exhibits a rich phase diagram with topological transitions and localization phenomena. The interplay between quasiperiodicity and non-Hermiticity introduces new topological invariants and modifies the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence, enabling the design of reconfigurable topological devices. Additionally, the tunability of interlayer couplings and the ability to introduce gain and loss in a controlled manner make van der Waals heterostructures ideal for investigating non-Hermitian effects in a highly controllable environment.\n\nFurthermore, the integration of non-Hermitian topology with van der Waals heterostructures has potential applications in photonic and electronic systems, where the unique properties of non-Hermitian edge states can be harnessed for robust signal transport and enhanced device performance. The study of these systems not only deepens our understanding of non-Hermitian physics but also paves the way for novel device architectures that leverage the interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity [1]. As experimental techniques advance, the exploration of non-Hermitian topology in van der Waals heterostructures is expected to yield groundbreaking insights and applications in quantum and classical wave systems."

      "content": "Homology and cohomology provide essential tools for characterizing topological properties in non-orientable systems, where traditional orientable assumptions fail. In such systems, the presence of non-trivial topological structures, such as exceptional points (EPs) and non-Abelian braiding, necessitates a generalized framework that accounts for orientation-reversing symmetries. Unlike in orientable systems, where homology groups are defined using consistent orientations, non-orientable systems require the use of twisted coefficients or cohomology with local systems to capture the global topological features accurately. This adaptation is crucial for describing the topological invariants that remain robust under continuous deformations, even when the system's fundamental domain is non-orientable [16].\n\nThe application of homology and cohomology in non-orientable systems is particularly relevant in the context of non-Hermitian topological phases, where the interplay between eigenvectors and eigenvalues leads to complex band structures [1]. In these systems, the homotopy classification of band structures becomes non-trivial due to the presence of EPs, which act as singularities in the parameter space [17]. Cohomology, especially with local coefficients, offers a powerful means to classify such structures by encoding the topological information in a way that respects the non-orientable nature of the underlying space. This approach allows for the definition of topological invariants that are invariant under continuous deformations, even in the presence of non-trivial symmetries.\n\nFurthermore, the study of homology and cohomology in non-orientable systems reveals new insights into the classification of topological phases that are not captured by conventional methods. By considering the effects of orientation-reversing symmetries on the topological structure, one can uncover previously unexplored invariants that are essential for understanding the stability and robustness of non-Hermitian systems [1]. These developments not only enrich the theoretical framework of topological physics but also pave the way for novel applications in quantum and classical systems with non-orientable geometries [2]."

This approach focuses on the behavior of states under periodic loops in the parameter space, where a state may evolve into a different state after completing a cycle. The classification relies on the fundamental group of the parameter space, which captures the topological equivalence of such loops. For non-separable bands, the absence of a clear band gap necessitates a more general topological analysis, often involving the study of exceptional points and the associated non-trivial monodromy. This method provides a robust way to characterize the global topology of the band structure, independent of local details.\n\nIn non-Hermitian systems, the homotopy classification extends beyond the conventional Hermitian framework by incorporating the complex nature of energy bands and the presence of exceptional points [17]. The topology of non-separable bands is determined by the winding of complex energy eigenvalues around these points, leading to distinct homotopy classes that reflect the system's topological structure. This classification is particularly relevant in systems with $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, where the interplay between symmetry and non-Hermiticity can lead to novel topological phases [1]. The homotopy groups of the parameter space, such as the fundamental group, provide a systematic way to enumerate and distinguish these phases, offering insights into the robustness and stability of topological features.\n\nThe application of homotopy theory to non-separable bands reveals the deep connection between topology and the global structure of the parameter space. By considering loops that cannot be continuously deformed into each other, one can identify distinct topological sectors that correspond to different physical behaviors. This approach is especially powerful in systems where the band structure is not gapped, such as in nodal semimetals or systems with exceptional lines [1]. The classification not only captures the topological invariants but also provides a pathway to understand how these invariants influence physical observables, such as edge states and transport properties. Thus, the homotopy classification serves as a foundational tool for exploring the rich topological landscape of non-Hermitian systems [1]."

Diffusion maps are employed to extract intrinsic geometric features of the energy landscape without requiring prior knowledge of the system's topology, enabling the identification of non-Bloch braiding patterns. This approach leverages the manifold structure of the energy bands, effectively capturing the underlying topological information through spectral embedding. By transforming the high-dimensional energy data into a lower-dimensional space, diffusion maps facilitate the detection of hidden symmetries and topological transitions that are otherwise difficult to discern.\n\nThe CNN component of the framework is trained to recognize and predict Bloch energy braiding based on the features extracted by diffusion maps [12]. This machine learning approach demonstrates remarkable accuracy, even when applied to topological elements not present in the training set. The CNN's ability to generalize from limited data highlights its robustness in handling the complex and often non-linear relationships inherent in non-Hermitian systems. Furthermore, the integration of diffusion maps and CNNs allows for a more comprehensive analysis of energy braiding, combining the strengths of unsupervised feature extraction with supervised learning for predictive modeling.\n\nThis hybrid approach not only enhances the efficiency of energy braiding analysis but also opens new avenues for exploring non-Hermitian topological phenomena in various physical systems [1]. By leveraging the topological insights provided by diffusion maps and the pattern recognition capabilities of CNNs, researchers can gain deeper understanding of energy braiding dynamics [12].

      "content": "Non-Bloch braiding refers to the topological entanglement of energy bands in non-Hermitian systems that cannot be captured by conventional Bloch band theory. Unlike Hermitian systems, where topological invariants are defined in the Brillouin zone, non-Bloch braiding arises due to the breakdown of periodic boundary conditions and the emergence of non-trivial eigenstate configurations [12]. This phenomenon is characterized by the exchange of states along one-dimensional loops in parameter space, leading to non-Abelian braid structures that are inherently robust against perturbations. The classification of such braiding is closely tied to homotopy theory, where the fundamental group and braid group provide the mathematical framework for understanding the topological properties of non-Hermitian systems [1].\n\nTopological pattern recognition in non-Bloch systems involves identifying and characterizing these braiding structures through advanced analytical and computational techniques. Recent studies have demonstrated that machine learning methods, such as diffusion maps and convolutional neural networks, can effectively detect non-Bloch braiding without prior knowledge of the system's topology [12]. These approaches enable the identification of topological invariants that are not accessible through traditional band structure analysis. Furthermore, the interplay between non-Bloch braiding and symmetry constraints plays a critical role in determining the stability and robustness of topological phases, particularly in systems with restricted spectral structures.\n\nThe study of non-Bloch braiding also reveals novel topological phenomena, such as the emergence of chiral edge states and the breakdown of conventional doubling principles. These effects are often linked to the non-Abelian nature of the braid group, which allows for the existence of topologically protected states that are insensitive to local perturbations. Additionally, the spontaneous breaking of $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry can be interpreted through a combined framework of Chern and Euler numbers, highlighting the deep connection between non-Hermitian topology and geometric invariants. Overall, non-Bloch braiding and topological pattern recognition offer new avenues for exploring the rich and complex behavior of non-Hermitian systems [12]."

Unlike Hermitian systems, where symmetries such as time-reversal, particle-hole, and chiral symmetries are well-defined, non-Hermitian systems introduce additional complexities due to the presence of complex eigenvalues and non-unitary dynamics [7]. These systems often exhibit $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, which ensures real eigenvalues under specific conditions and serves as a fundamental symmetry for characterizing topological phases. The classification of such systems involves extending traditional symmetry-based approaches to accommodate the non-Hermitian nature, leading to the development of generalized symmetry classes and associated topological invariants [1].\n\nThe homotopy classification of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians provides a robust mathematical framework for identifying topologically distinct phases [17]. This approach involves analyzing the topological structure of the parameter space, particularly focusing on the winding of complex energy bands and the formation of exceptional points [17].

      "content": "Exceptional points (EPs) represent a unique topological feature in non-Hermitian systems, where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, leading to a breakdown of the conventional spectral gap. These points are characterized by the vorticity of complex eigenenergies when encircling them, revealing a non-trivial topological structure [17]. EPs can extend into higher-dimensional structures such as exceptional lines, rings, and Hopf bundles, forming intricate topological networks in multiband systems. Their presence is not restricted to specific parameter regimes but emerges generically in two- and three-dimensional systems, often under the influence of discrete symmetries like $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. These topological features are essential for understanding the robustness and stability of non-Hermitian systems against perturbations [1].\n\nThe study of non-Abelian loops around EPs introduces a rich framework for characterizing topological phases in non-Hermitian systems [1]. Unlike Abelian loops, which yield simple phase factors, non-Abelian loops lead to more complex transformations of eigenstates, reflecting the non-trivial braiding of eigenmodes. This behavior is closely tied to the homotopy structure of the parameter space and can be analyzed through fundamental group representations. The non-Abelian nature of these loops is particularly evident when multiple EPs are present, as their interplay can lead to non-trivial topological invariants. These invariants are not dependent on a reference point or line, making them suitable for systems with symmetry constraints that limit the choice of reference structures.\n\nThe topological classification of non-Hermitian systems often involves winding numbers, complex Berry phases, and homotopy equivalence classes, which provide complementary perspectives on the system's structure [17]. For systems with non-separable bands, the homotopy classification becomes critical, as it captures the global connectivity of the parameter space. In the presence of EPs, the winding number around a loop can become a half-integer, indicating the non-trivial topological nature of the EPs. These insights are essential for understanding the emergence of exotic phenomena such as non-Hermitian skin effects and the robustness of topological states in open systems [10]. The interplay between EPs and non-Abelian loops thus offers a powerful tool for exploring the topological landscape of non-Hermitian systems [2]."

      "content": "Despite significant progress in the study of non-Hermitian topological phenomena, several key limitations and gaps remain in the current understanding of these systems. One major challenge lies in the generalization of topological invariants to non-Hermitian systems, where the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence often breaks down due to the non-Bloch nature of the eigenstates. This complicates the reliable identification and classification of topological phases, particularly in systems with complex band structures or strong non-Hermitian effects. Additionally, the experimental realization of non-Hermitian topological states in a wide range of physical platforms remains limited, with most studies focusing on photonic and electronic systems. The extension of these concepts to other domains, such as acoustic, mechanical, and quantum systems, is still in its early stages. Furthermore, the interplay between non-Hermiticity and symmetry, especially in systems with unconventional symmetries or in higher dimensions, is not yet fully understood, leaving many open questions regarding the stability and robustness of non-Hermitian topological phases.\n\nTo address these challenges, future research should focus on developing more robust and generalizable frameworks for topological classification in non-Hermitian systems. This includes the refinement of mathematical tools such as singular value decomposition and non-Bloch band theory to accurately capture the topological properties of complex systems. Additionally, the exploration of new experimental platforms, such as cold atomic gases and hybrid quantum-optical systems, could provide novel insights into the behavior of non-Hermitian topological states. The integration of machine learning techniques for the automated identification and prediction of non-Hermitian topological phases also represents a promising direction, as these methods can efficiently analyze large and complex datasets. Furthermore, the study of topological phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems under varying boundary conditions and symmetry constraints could reveal new universal features of these systems. The development of synthetic gauge fields and Floquet modulation techniques to engineer non-Hermitian topological phases in a controlled manner is another important area for future investigation.\n\nThe proposed future work has the potential to significantly advance the field of non-Hermitian topological physics, with far-reaching implications for both fundamental science and technological applications. A deeper understanding of the topological invariants and their interplay with non-Hermitian effects could lead to the discovery of new topological phases and the development of more robust topological devices. The ability to control and manipulate non-Hermitian topological states through synthetic gauge fields and Floquet engineering could enable the design of novel photonic, electronic, and quantum devices with enhanced performance and stability. Moreover, the integration of machine learning and data-driven approaches could accelerate the discovery of complex topological phenomena, making it possible to explore systems that were previously intractable with traditional analytical methods. Ultimately, these advancements could pave the way for the next generation of topological technologies, with applications in quantum information processing, sensing, and energy-efficient wave manipulation."
