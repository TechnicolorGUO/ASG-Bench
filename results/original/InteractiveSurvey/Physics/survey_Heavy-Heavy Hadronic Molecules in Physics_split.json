      "content": "The study of hadronic molecules, particularly those composed of heavy quarks, has emerged as a central topic in modern particle physics [1]. These exotic states, which include tetraquarks, pentaquarks, and molecular configurations, challenge the conventional quark model and provide unique insights into the non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [2]. The strong interaction, which governs the behavior of quarks and gluons, becomes particularly complex in the regime of heavy quark systems, where the dynamics are dominated by confinement and the interplay of quark-gluon interactions. Traditional approaches, such as perturbative QCD, are insufficient for describing the formation and decay of these states, necessitating the development of alternative frameworks. Over the past few decades, significant progress has been made in understanding the structure of heavy quark systems through a combination of lattice QCD simulations, holographic methods, effective field theories, and experimental studies [3]. These efforts have not only expanded our knowledge of hadronic spectroscopy but also revealed the rich complexity of QCD in the non-perturbative regime [4].\n\nThis survey paper focuses on the theoretical and experimental investigations of heavy-heavy hadronic molecules, with a particular emphasis on the interplay between holographic methods, lattice QCD, and effective field theories. The paper explores the dual descriptions of heavy quark systems through string interactions, which provide a powerful framework for understanding the non-perturbative dynamics of bound states [5]. It also examines the engineering of holographic models from experimental mass spectra, highlighting the role of the dilaton field and string interactions in capturing the properties of heavy quarkonia [6]. Additionally, the paper discusses the analysis of scattering amplitudes in confined quark systems, the role of Wick contractions in tetraquark channels, and the application of SU(3) inspired models to hybrid state masses and decays. These approaches collectively contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the structure and behavior of heavy quark systems [7].\n\nThe paper further delves into the role of effective field theories and potential models in describing hybrid baryon structures, with a focus on semirelativistic approaches that incorporate relativistic corrections [8]. It also addresses the spectroscopic analysis and decay mechanisms of exotic hadrons, emphasizing the importance of collider experiments in identifying these states [9]. The molecular picture of the X(3872) and Zc(3900) in B decays is explored, alongside the development of unified frameworks for TCC and TBB molecular states. The application of the maximum entropy method to valence quark distributions and the threshold-cusp mechanism for exotic state formations are also discussed, highlighting the interplay between theoretical models and experimental data. Finally, the paper examines model-independent predictions from chiral effective field theory and heavy quark spin symmetry, as well as the use of one-boson-exchange models and coupled-channel formalisms in analyzing molecular states and their decays.\n\nThis survey paper makes several key contributions to the field of heavy quark hadronic molecules [3]. It provides a comprehensive overview of the theoretical and experimental techniques used to study these exotic states, offering a unified perspective on the various approaches. By integrating insights from holography, lattice QCD, and effective field theories, the paper highlights the strengths and limitations of each method, guiding future research in the field. Additionally, it identifies open questions and challenges that remain, such as the precise determination of coupling constants, the role of isospin-breaking effects, and the distinction between molecular and compact tetraquark interpretations. These contributions aim to facilitate a deeper understanding of the non-perturbative structure of QCD and the nature of heavy quark systems, ultimately advancing the study of exotic hadrons in both theoretical and experimental contexts [10]."

      "level": 3,
      "content": "In the context of heavy quark systems, dual descriptions through string interactions offer a powerful framework for understanding the dynamics of bound states in the strong interaction regime [5]. By leveraging gauge/string duality, researchers construct string configurations in five-dimensional spacetime that correspond to the low-lying Baryon-Oppenheimer (B-O) potentials in the heavy quark limit [11]. These configurations provide a holographic representation of the potential energy between heavy quarks, allowing for the exploration of non-perturbative effects that are otherwise intractable within traditional QCD approaches. The dual descriptions are particularly useful in capturing the behavior of systems such as tetraquarks and pentaquarks, where conventional quark models fail to account for the observed spectral features.\n\nThe analysis of these string configurations involves the introduction of length scales that characterize transitions between different string states. These scales are intrinsically linked to various string interactions, including reconnection, breaking, and junction annihilation. Such interactions play a critical role in determining the stability and binding energy of the corresponding heavy quark systems. By examining the dynamics of these interactions, researchers can gain insights into the underlying structure of the hadrons and the nature of the forces that bind them [1]. Additionally, the inclusion of multiple volumes and advanced smearing techniques in lattice studies enhances the precision of these dual descriptions, enabling a more accurate determination of the binding energy and other key properties.\n\nThe dual approach also facilitates the extension of holographic models to more complex systems, such as multiquark states, which are challenging to describe using conventional methods [6]. By incorporating additional terms derived from the Bethe-Salpeter equation for diquarks, the framework allows for a more realistic representation of confinement and the formation of exotic hadrons. This not only enriches the theoretical understanding of heavy quark systems but also provides a pathway for future investigations into the spectroscopy and decay properties of these states. Ultimately, the dual descriptions through string interactions serve as a vital tool in bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations in the realm of non-perturbative QCD."

      "content": "The construction of holographic models from experimental mass spectra involves a systematic mapping between the observed hadronic states and the dual gravitational theory. This process typically begins with the identification of key features in the experimental data, such as mass gaps, level spacings, and quantum number patterns, which are then used to constrain the form of the holographic potential. By incorporating the Regge trajectory behavior and the nonlinear mass spectra observed in heavy quarkonia, the holographic dual can be engineered to reproduce the empirical data. This approach leverages the AdS/CFT correspondence to translate the nonperturbative dynamics of QCD into a classical gravitational problem, where the bulk geometry encodes the properties of the strongly coupled system [6].\n\nA critical aspect of engineering holographic models is the determination of the dilaton field, which governs the scale dependence of the dual theory. The form of the dilaton is often inferred from the experimental mass spectrum, with nonlinearities in the spectrum suggesting a non-quadratic dilaton profile. This allows for a more accurate description of the hadronic spectrum, particularly in the regime of heavy quarkonia where deviations from linearity are observed. Additionally, the inclusion of string interactions, such as reconnection, breaking, and junction annihilation, provides a more realistic representation of the underlying QCD dynamics [5]. These features are essential for capturing the complex interplay between quark and gluon degrees of freedom in the holographic framework.\n\nThe effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through its ability to reproduce both the qualitative and quantitative features of the hadronic spectrum. By systematically adjusting the parameters of the holographic model to match experimental data, it becomes possible to extract insights into the nonperturbative structure of QCD [4]. This method not only provides a powerful tool for understanding the nature of exotic hadrons but also offers a way to test the validity of holographic models against empirical observations [6]. The resulting models serve as a bridge between the theoretical predictions of QCD and the experimental findings, enabling a deeper exploration of the strong interaction regime [4]."

      "content": "The analysis of scattering amplitudes in confined quark systems plays a critical role in understanding the dynamics of hadronic interactions, particularly in the context of exotic and heavy quark systems. Lattice QCD provides a non-perturbative framework to extract these amplitudes by simulating the system on a finite spatial volume. The scattering amplitude is typically determined by analyzing the energy levels of the system and applying effective field theories or finite-volume methods. For systems like the $T_{bb}$ tetraquark, the scattering amplitude analysis is essential to distinguish between bound states and resonances, as well as to extract the binding energy with high precision. This approach allows for a rigorous investigation of the interplay between quark confinement and the formation of stable hadronic states.\n\nIn the heavy quark limit, the scattering amplitudes are influenced by the specific quantum numbers and symmetries of the system, which dictate the possible interactions and decay channels [12]. The use of multiple lattice volumes and advanced smearing techniques, such as box-sink smearing, helps to reduce systematic uncertainties and improve the accuracy of the amplitude extraction. Additionally, the inclusion of non-zero total momenta in the analysis provides a more comprehensive picture of the system's behavior. These methods are particularly important for systems where the binding energy is small, as they enable the detection of subtle effects that could otherwise be masked by noise or lattice artifacts.\n\nThe results of such scattering amplitude analyses have significant implications for the theoretical understanding of QCD in the non-perturbative regime [4]. They provide direct insights into the nature of quark confinement and the structure of hadrons beyond the conventional quark model [13]. By comparing lattice results with theoretical predictions from models such as QCD sum rules or effective string theories, researchers can refine their understanding of the underlying dynamics. These studies also contribute to the broader goal of mapping the hadron spectrum and identifying new states that may arise from complex quark-gluon configurations [11]."

      "level": 3,
      "content": "The role of Wick contractions in tetraquark channels is central to understanding the structure and interactions of four-quark systems. These contractions, which arise from the fermionic nature of quarks, determine the possible ways in which quark fields can be paired to form physical states. In the context of tetraquark states, Wick contractions dictate the contributions of different quark configurations to the overall correlation functions. For instance, in the $I = 0$ and $I = 1$ channels of $DD^*$ systems, the same set of four-quark Wick contractions contributes, but their relative weights differ due to isospin symmetry [12]. This distinction is crucial for accurately modeling the dynamics of tetraquark states and distinguishing them from molecular or hybrid configurations.\n\nIsospin factors further influence the structure of tetraquark channels by encoding the symmetry properties of the quark content. The isospin quantum numbers determine how the quark fields combine, affecting the overall wave function and the resulting scattering amplitudes. In particular, the differences between $I = 0$ and $I = 1$ channels arise from the signs associated with specific Wick contractions, such as $\\zeta_2$ and $\\mathcal{D}'$ [12]. These factors play a key role in determining the relative contributions of different quark configurations and are essential for interpreting lattice QCD results. The interplay between isospin symmetry and Wick contractions thus provides a framework for analyzing the internal structure of tetraquark states and their interactions.\n\nThe systematic study of Wick contractions and isospin factors is vital for disentangling the complex dynamics of tetraquark systems. These elements influence not only the form of correlation functions but also the interpretation of lattice data in terms of bound states or resonances. By carefully accounting for these factors, researchers can better isolate the contributions of different quark configurations and assess the validity of theoretical models. This analysis is particularly important in the context of heavy quark systems, where the interplay between isospin symmetry and non-perturbative QCD effects can lead to subtle but significant differences in the observed spectra [2]."

These models incorporate the structure of SU(3) multiplets to predict the existence and characteristics of exotic states, such as tetraquarks and hybrid baryons [14]. By extending the conventional quark model, they account for the presence of additional gluonic degrees of freedom, which are essential for describing hybrid states. The SU(3) symmetry allows for systematic classification of these states, enabling predictions of their masses and decay channels based on group-theoretical considerations. This approach is particularly useful in identifying patterns in the spectrum of heavy quark systems, where the symmetry is more robust due to the larger mass scales involved.\n\nThe application of SU(3) inspired models to hybrid states involves constructing effective potentials that incorporate both quark and gluonic interactions. These potentials are often derived from first-principles methods such as lattice QCD or through phenomenological parametrizations that reflect the nonperturbative nature of QCD. The resulting models can predict the binding energies and decay widths of hybrid states by considering the interplay between quark and gluon configurations [14]. Additionally, the inclusion of SU(3) symmetry allows for the exploration of transitions between different hadronic states, such as the conversion of a tetraquark into a meson-baryon system. This approach has been instrumental in understanding the dynamics of exotic hadrons and their role in the broader spectrum of QCD [8].\n\nRecent developments in SU(3) inspired models have focused on refining the treatment of gluonic excitations and their impact on hadronic masses and decays. By incorporating string-like interactions and considering the effects of quark mass differences, these models offer a more realistic description of hybrid states. The use of SU(3) symmetry also facilitates the comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental data, enabling the identification of new states and the validation of existing models. Overall, SU(3) inspired models continue to play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of hybrid hadrons, providing a bridge between the fundamental principles of QCD and the observed spectrum of exotic particles."

These methods typically employ a relativistic kinetic energy term while maintaining a nonrelativistic form for the interaction potential, allowing for a more accurate description of systems where quark velocities are significant but not extreme. In the context of hybrid baryons, which include a dynamical gluon in addition to quarks, semirelativistic models provide a framework to study the interplay between quark-gluon interactions and the overall baryon structure [8]. Such approaches are particularly useful in capturing the dynamics of gluonic excitations, which are essential for understanding the internal composition and stability of hybrid baryons.\n\nThe development of semirelativistic models for hybrid baryons often involves the use of effective potentials derived from QCD-inspired interactions, such as the Cornell potential or its variants, combined with relativistic corrections to the kinetic energy [8]. These potentials are calibrated to reproduce known baryon spectra and are then extended to include the effects of gluonic degrees of freedom. By incorporating relativistic effects, these models can better account for the energy levels and wave functions of hybrid baryons, particularly in cases where the quark masses are not negligible [15]. Additionally, semirelativistic approaches facilitate the study of transitions between different baryon configurations, such as the formation of hybrid states from conventional baryons through gluonic excitation.\n\nRecent advances in semirelativistic modeling have focused on improving the accuracy of wave function calculations and the treatment of spin-orbit coupling, which plays a crucial role in the fine structure of baryon spectra. These models are also being used to investigate the role of string-like configurations in the QCD vacuum, particularly in relation to the dynamics of quark-gluon interactions [5]. By refining the treatment of relativistic effects, such approaches contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of hybrid baryon structures and their implications for the broader landscape of exotic hadrons [8]."

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), with its unprecedented collision energies and luminosities, has become a key facility for exploring heavy-quarkonium production and suppression [17]. Experiments such as ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb offer complementary capabilities, with CMS and ATLAS featuring central detectors optimized for precision dimuon spectroscopy, while LHCb focuses on the forward region for detailed particle identification and vertex reconstruction [17]. These experimental setups enable the detection of rare decay channels and the observation of non-conventional hadronic states.\n\nThe identification of exotic hadrons often relies on the observation of unusual decay patterns and mass distributions that deviate from standard quark model predictions [3]. For example, the X(3872) was first discovered in B meson decays and exhibits a mass significantly lower than expected, suggesting a non-standard structure. The production mechanisms, such as the rescattering of charmed mesons, provide insights into the dynamics of these states. The study of branching fractions and decay ratios, such as those involving J/ψ and π mesons, helps distinguish between different theoretical models, including molecular or tetraquark interpretations. These measurements are essential for validating or refuting hypotheses about the internal structure of exotic hadrons [18].\n\nRecent high-luminosity runs at the LHC have enabled comprehensive studies of quarkonium production, polarizations, and rare transitions, leading to the discovery of new particles and the refinement of existing ones. The observation of states like Z_c(3900) and P_c(4380) has further expanded the landscape of exotic hadrons, prompting extensive theoretical and experimental investigations [19].

These form factors encode information about the spatial distribution of charge and current within the baryon, providing insights into the underlying quark-gluon interactions. They are typically extracted from experimental data on processes such as photo- and electroproduction of baryon resonances, where the transition amplitude is related to the form factors through a combination of theoretical models and phenomenological parametrizations. The study of these form factors is essential for testing the predictions of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the non-perturbative regime and for validating the quark model and its extensions [4].\n\nTheoretical approaches to calculating these form factors include effective field theories, lattice QCD, and constituent quark models, each offering different levels of accuracy and applicability. Effective field theories, such as chiral perturbation theory, provide a systematic framework for describing low-energy hadronic interactions, while lattice QCD allows for first-principles calculations of form factors from the QCD Lagrangian. Constituent quark models, on the other hand, offer a more intuitive picture of the baryon structure, often incorporating relativistic effects and spin-orbit couplings. Despite these advances, challenges remain in accurately predicting the form factors for excited baryon states, particularly those with complex quark configurations or strong coupling to decay channels.\n\nRecent experimental efforts, such as those at Jefferson Lab and the Mainz Microtron, have significantly improved the precision of form factor measurements, enabling more stringent tests of theoretical models. These measurements are often complemented by studies of electromagnetic transitions in exclusive reactions, which provide additional constraints on the form factors.

X(3872) is widely considered a candidate for a $\\bar{D}^* D$ molecular state, with its production in B meson decays offering critical insights into its dynamics. Theoretical models suggest that X(3872) arises from the rescattering of $\\bar{D}^* D$ pairs in the decay process, with the branching fractions depending on the interplay between the hadronic interactions and the underlying quark structure. However, the lack of observation of other $\\bar{D}^* D^{(*)}$ molecular states in B decays raises questions about the universality of such mechanisms and the role of quantum numbers in their formation [20]. This discrepancy highlights the need for a more comprehensive theoretical framework to explain the observed patterns in B meson decays.\n\nThe Zc(3900), on the other hand, is often interpreted as a tetraquark state, with its charged nature suggesting a configuration of four quarks, such as $c \\bar{c} u \\bar{d}$. Its production in B decays, particularly in channels involving $\\bar{D}^* D$ and $D \\bar{D}^*$, has been studied extensively, yet the precise mechanism remains unclear. While the molecular model provides a plausible explanation for X(3872), the tetraquark interpretation of Zc(3900) introduces additional complexities, such as the role of color configurations and the influence of gluonic degrees of freedom. These differences underscore the importance of distinguishing between molecular and compact tetraquark states through detailed experimental and theoretical investigations.\n\nThe branching fractions of X(3872) and Zc(3900) in B decays are crucial for validating their molecular or tetraquark nature. However, the current theoretical predictions for these branching fractions are inconsistent, and the lack of a unified framework complicates the interpretation of experimental data. Moreover, the observation of X(3872) in multiple decay channels, while Zc(3900) is seen in fewer, suggests that the production mechanisms may differ significantly. This calls for further studies to clarify the underlying dynamics and to determine whether these states are governed by similar or distinct production mechanisms in B meson decays."

These frameworks often integrate principles from heavy quark symmetry (HQSS) and effective field theories, allowing for the description of both tetraquark and molecular configurations within a single formalism. By leveraging symmetry considerations and non-perturbative QCD techniques, researchers seek to establish a unified picture that can account for the observed decay patterns and spectroscopic features of TCC and TBB states. Such approaches are essential for interpreting experimental data and guiding future investigations into the nature of these complex hadronic systems.\n\nThe development of these unified frameworks is closely tied to the study of hadronic decays of $B_{(s)}$ mesons, where TCC and TBB states are expected to manifest. Theoretical models such as the color-singlet model, color-octet mechanism, and color-evaporation model are often employed to describe the production and decay dynamics of these states.

By maximizing the entropy of a probability distribution subject to constraints derived from theoretical models or experimental data, MEM provides a robust framework for inferring the most likely distribution of quark momenta within a hadron. This approach is especially valuable for exotic hadrons, such as the $Z_c(3900)$, where conventional methods struggle to extract precise information due to the complex nature of their quark content. The method effectively balances the need for accuracy with the constraints imposed by limited data, ensuring that the reconstructed distributions are both physically meaningful and statistically consistent.\n\nIn the context of valence quark distributions, MEM is applied to determine the momentum fraction carried by quarks within a hadron, taking into account the constraints imposed by QCD and the symmetries of the strong interaction [18]. For example, in the case of the $Z_c(3900)$, the method is used to deduce the distribution of valence quarks based on theoretical models of its tetraquark structure. The reconstructed distributions provide insights into the internal dynamics of the hadron, such as the relative contributions of different quark flavors and their spatial extent. This information is crucial for understanding the nature of exotic hadrons and their role in the broader landscape of QCD [5].\n\nThe application of MEM to valence quark distributions has demonstrated its effectiveness in a variety of hadronic systems, including the proton, neutron, pion, and kaon [18].

      "content": "The threshold-cusp mechanism provides a compelling framework for understanding the formation of exotic hadronic states, particularly those observed near thresholds of open-flavor meson pairs. When a resonance lies close to the threshold of a hadronic channel, the phase space available for decay can lead to a sharp enhancement in the production amplitude, manifesting as a cusp-like structure in the invariant mass distribution. This effect is especially relevant for states such as $X(3872)$ and $Z_c(3900)$, which are observed near the $\\bar{D}^*D$ and $J/\\psi \\pi$ thresholds, respectively. The cusp effect arises from the interference between the direct decay amplitude and the amplitude involving the intermediate meson pair, leading to a non-trivial dependence on the kinematics of the decay process. Such features are crucial for distinguishing between molecular, tetraquark, or conventional charmonium interpretations of these states.\n\nThe threshold-cusp explanation is further supported by the observation of isospin-breaking effects in certain decay channels, which are difficult to reconcile with conventional quarkonium models. For example, the $B \\to X(3872) \\pi^0$ and $B \\to Z_c(3900) \\pi^\\pm$ decays exhibit anomalies that suggest a strong coupling to open-charm meson states. These observations align with the idea that the observed states are not isolated resonances but rather dynamically generated through the interaction of meson pairs near their threshold. The cusp effect can naturally account for the observed mass distributions and decay patterns, offering a unified explanation for multiple experimental findings without requiring a specific internal quark structure.\n\nMoreover, the threshold-cusp mechanism is not limited to heavy quarkonium systems but can also apply to other exotic states, such as those involving bottomonium or hybrid mesons. The interplay between the threshold dynamics and the underlying QCD interactions provides a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting the observed enhancements in the mass spectra. This approach is particularly valuable in the context of future experiments, where high-precision data will be essential for disentangling the nature of these states. By leveraging the threshold-cusp effect, researchers can gain deeper insights into the structure and dynamics of exotic hadrons, advancing our understanding of QCD in the non-perturbative regime [4]."

These predictions rely on the symmetries of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at low energies, where the interactions between heavy and light quarks can be systematically expanded in terms of small parameters [14]. By leveraging the constraints imposed by chiral symmetry and HQSS, the couplings and decay amplitudes of the $X(3872)$ to $D^{(*)}\\bar{D}^{(*)}$ and $\\chi_{cJ}$ states can be determined without relying on specific hadronic models. This approach ensures that the results are consistent with the underlying symmetries of QCD and minimizes model-dependent uncertainties.\n\nThe interplay between chiral EFT and HQSS allows for the derivation of relations between different hadronic couplings, which are crucial for understanding the structure of the $X(3872)$. For instance, the isospin-breaking effects in the $X(3872)\\pi^0\\chi_{cJ}$ decay can be analyzed using the precisely determined isospin-breaking amplitude ratio $R_X$, which constrains the mixing angle $\\theta$ and the coupling $g_1$ [19]. These constraints, combined with the symmetry-based predictions, enable the derivation of upper bounds on the coupling squared $g_1^2$ and the branching ratios of the $X(3872)\\pi^0\\chi_{c1,2}(1P)$ decays [19]. Such results are essential for validating or refuting the molecular nature of the $X(3872)$ and for guiding future experimental studies.\n\nFurthermore, the application of chiral EFT and HQSS to the $D^{(*)}\\bar{D}^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)}D^{(*)}$ interactions reveals the effects of symmetry breaking, which are critical for understanding the dynamics of hadronic molecules. The small mass differences between $D^*$ and $D$ mesons, as well as between $D^{(*)}$ and $\\Xi_{cc}^{(*)}$, allow for a coupled-channel analysis that respects HQSS. This analysis provides insights into the pole positions and decay properties of the $W_{c1}$ states, which are predicted to be virtual states of the scattering matrix. These findings highlight the power of model-independent approaches in uncovering the fundamental structure of exotic hadrons [18]."

The $X(3872)$ and its counterparts, such as the $T_{cc}^+$, have been extensively analyzed in terms of their decay modes, particularly those involving isospin-breaking effects. These decays, such as $X(3872)\\pi^+\\pi^-J/\\psi$ and $X(3872)\\pi^0\\chi_{cJ}$, provide critical insights into the composition of the pentaquark state, as the partial widths are sensitive to the relative contributions of different hadronic components [21].

Theoretical approaches, including effective field theories and lattice QCD, have been employed to model these decays, emphasizing the role of unitarized scattering amplitudes and the extraction of pole positions from the complex energy plane. The decay widths and branching ratios are influenced by the proximity of the pentaquark to the relevant hadronic thresholds, with the molecular nature of the state leading to specific decay signatures [21]. These studies have also revealed the importance of final-state interactions and the triangle singularity mechanism in shaping the decay dynamics, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between quark and hadronic degrees of freedom.\n\nThe investigation of pentaquark decays in molecular models has also been instrumental in probing the spin and parity of these states, as well as their possible isospin partners. The decay modes involving multiple mesons, such as $X(3872)\\pi^0\\pi^+\\pi^-$, provide additional constraints on the internal structure and the coupling strengths between the molecular components. By analyzing the phase space and the contributions from two-body and three-body decay channels, researchers have been able to refine theoretical predictions and compare them with experimental data.

      "content": "The one-boson-exchange (OBE) model has been widely employed to investigate the interactions between heavy mesons and tetraquark states, providing a framework to understand the dynamics of hadronic molecules [22]. This approach assumes that the interaction between two heavy mesons is mediated by the exchange of light mesons such as pions, rho, omega, and sigma. The resulting potentials respect the symmetries of the strong interaction, including heavy quark spin symmetry and chiral symmetry, and are parameterized by coupling constants and a cutoff scale. These models are particularly useful in describing the binding mechanisms of tetraquarks, such as the doubly charmed $T_{cc}$ state, by accounting for the effective interactions between the constituent mesons. The OBE model's ability to incorporate both short-range and long-range effects makes it a versatile tool in studying the structure and decay properties of exotic hadrons [21].\n\nIn the context of tetraquark interactions, the OBE model is often combined with coupled-channel formalisms to account for the complex interplay between different meson-meson channels. This allows for a more accurate description of the binding energies and decay amplitudes, particularly in cases where the tetraquark state lies close to a meson-meson threshold. The model's predictions are sensitive to the choice of coupling constants and the cutoff parameter, which are typically determined by fitting to experimental data or lattice QCD results. For example, in the case of the $X(3872)$, the OBE model has been used to explore the role of isospin-breaking effects and the coupling between different meson loops. These studies highlight the importance of considering both the strength and the structure of the interaction potentials in understanding the properties of tetraquark states.\n\nDespite its success, the OBE model faces challenges in accurately determining the coupling constants from experimental data, especially when the interactions involve multiple channels or non-perturbative effects. The model's reliance on effective field theories and symmetry considerations introduces uncertainties that must be carefully addressed. Nevertheless, the OBE framework remains a crucial component in the theoretical investigation of tetraquark interactions, offering a systematic way to explore the underlying quark dynamics and the role of meson exchange in binding heavy quark systems. Continued refinement of the model, combined with experimental and lattice QCD inputs, is essential for a deeper understanding of the nature of tetraquarks and their interactions."

By considering the coupled-channel effects, the formalism enables the description of the molecular state's behavior near thresholds, where the proximity of different channels leads to significant modifications in the wavefunction and decay amplitudes. This framework is particularly important for systems where the mass differences between channels are small, as it allows for a more accurate representation of the underlying interactions and the resulting pole structures in the complex energy plane.\n\nThe formalism is typically implemented through unitarized scattering amplitudes, which ensure the conservation of probability and the correct treatment of resonant and bound states. In the context of molecular states, this involves solving the Schrödinger equation with a Hamiltonian that includes the interactions between different channels. The resulting eigenstates reflect the coupled nature of the system, with the molecular state manifesting as a pole in the scattering matrix. This approach is crucial for extracting information about the binding energy, decay width, and coupling strengths of the molecular state, which are key parameters in determining its structure and properties.\n\nMoreover, the coupled-channel formalism is instrumental in studying the effects of symmetries such as heavy quark spin symmetry (HQS) and isospin symmetry. These symmetries impose constraints on the couplings between different channels, allowing for a more systematic analysis of the molecular state's properties. By incorporating these symmetries, the formalism provides a robust framework for predicting the existence of isospin partners and other related states, which can be tested through experimental observations. Overall, the coupled-channel formalism offers a powerful tool for probing the internal structure and dynamics of molecular states in the context of quantum chromodynamics."

A primary challenge lies in the accurate determination of coupling constants and decay amplitudes for exotic states, which are often constrained by limited experimental data and theoretical uncertainties. Additionally, the distinction between molecular and compact tetraquark interpretations of observed states remains ambiguous, particularly in cases where isospin-breaking effects and final-state interactions complicate the analysis. Theoretical models, such as effective field theories and holographic approaches, provide valuable insights but often lack the precision required to fully capture the dynamics of heavy quark systems. Furthermore, the interplay between different quark-gluon configurations, including hybrid states and multiquark systems, is not yet fully understood, highlighting the need for more comprehensive frameworks that integrate lattice QCD, holography, and experimental data.\n\nTo address these challenges, future research should focus on refining theoretical models through the incorporation of more precise lattice QCD results and improved holographic constructions. This includes the development of advanced coupled-channel formalisms that can accurately describe the interactions between different meson-meson and quark-antiquark configurations. Additionally, the application of effective field theories with enhanced symmetry constraints, such as heavy quark spin symmetry and chiral symmetry, could lead to more reliable predictions for decay amplitudes and coupling constants. The integration of machine learning techniques for data analysis and parameter optimization may also provide new avenues for improving the accuracy of theoretical models. Furthermore, experimental efforts should prioritize high-precision measurements of decay modes, amplitude ratios, and isospin-breaking effects, which are critical for distinguishing between molecular and compact interpretations of exotic states. The refinement of threshold-cusp analyses and the exploration of new decay channels will be essential in validating the theoretical predictions and uncovering the underlying structure of these states.\n\nThe proposed future work holds significant potential for advancing our understanding of QCD in the non-perturbative regime and the nature of heavy quark systems. By bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental observations, these efforts will contribute to a more complete description of the hadron spectrum and the dynamics of quark-gluon interactions. The development of unified frameworks that incorporate multiple theoretical approaches, such as holography, lattice QCD, and effective field theories, will enable a more systematic exploration of exotic hadrons and their properties. Moreover, the improved precision in determining coupling constants and decay amplitudes will have broader implications for the study of hadronic interactions, including the prediction of new states and the validation of existing models.
