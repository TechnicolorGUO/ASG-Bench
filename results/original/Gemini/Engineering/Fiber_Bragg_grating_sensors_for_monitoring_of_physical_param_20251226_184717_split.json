This comprehensive review systematically examines the evolution, theoretical underpinnings, and state-of-the-art applications of FBG technology in monitoring physical parameters such as strain, temperature, pressure, acceleration, and tilt. We trace the historical trajectory from Ken Hill’s serendipitous discovery to the latest femtosecond laser inscription techniques.

      "heading": "1. Introduction",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The monitoring of physical parameters is a fundamental requirement across a spectrum of industries, ranging from civil infrastructure and aerospace to energy production and healthcare. Traditional sensing technologies, primarily based on resistive strain gauges, thermocouples, and piezoelectric transducers, have long served these industries. However, these electrical sensors face inherent limitations, including susceptibility to electromagnetic interference (EMI), signal attenuation over long distances, and the risk of sparking in explosive environments [cite: 1, 2].\n\nOptical fiber sensors (OFS) have emerged as a robust alternative, with Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) representing the most mature and widely adopted segment of this technology [cite: 3]. An FBG is a periodic modulation of the refractive index within the core of an optical fiber, acting as a wavelength-selective mirror. The reflected wavelength, known as the Bragg wavelength, shifts linearly in response to external physical perturbations such as strain and temperature [cite: 4, 5].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the rapid diversification of FBG applications and the recent technological leaps in fabrication and interrogation. While early research focused on basic strain and temperature sensing, contemporary studies have expanded into complex parameter monitoring, including liquid level, inclination, and vibration, often utilizing advanced materials and signal processing techniques [cite: 6, 7, 8]. Furthermore, the integration of FBG sensors into smart structures and the Internet of Things (IoT) represents a paradigm shift in how critical assets are monitored [cite: 9, 10].\n\nThis paper aims to provide a rigorous, systematic review of FBG sensors for monitoring physical parameters. It covers the theoretical background, historical milestones, fabrication techniques, and interrogation methods. It critically evaluates applications in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), aerospace, and biomedical engineering, while addressing the significant challenges of cross-sensitivity and packaging. Finally, it outlines future research directions, emphasizing the convergence of photonics with deep learning and nanotechnology."

      "content": "The fundamental principle of an FBG sensor relies on the Bragg condition. When a broadband light source is injected into the fiber, the grating reflects a narrow spectral band centered at the Bragg wavelength ($\\lambda_B$), while transmitting all other wavelengths. The Bragg wavelength is defined by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\lambda_B = 2 n_{eff} \\Lambda \\]\n\nwhere $n_{eff}$ is the effective refractive index of the fiber core and $\\Lambda$ is the grating period [cite: 5, 11].\n\nExternal physical parameters perturb the grating by altering either the refractive index ($n_{eff}$) or the grating period ($\\Lambda$).\n*   **Strain Sensing:** Longitudinal strain ($\\epsilon$) elongates the fiber (changing $\\Lambda$) and alters the refractive index via the photo-elastic effect. The wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_B$) is expressed as:\n    \\[ \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_B}{\\lambda_B} = (1 - p_e) \\epsilon \\]\n    where $p_e$ is the effective strain-optic coefficient [cite: 12, 13].\n*   **Temperature Sensing:** Temperature changes ($\\Delta T$) induce thermal expansion (changing $\\Lambda$) and alter the refractive index via the thermo-optic effect. The shift is given by:\n    \\[ \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_B}{\\lambda_B} = (\\alpha + \\zeta) \\Delta T \\]\n    where $\\alpha$ is the thermal expansion coefficient and $\\zeta$ is the thermo-optic coefficient [cite: 11, 12]."

They are used for dispersion compensation and sensing over large strain gradients [cite: 14, 15].\n*   **Tilted FBGs (TFBG):** The grating planes are tilted relative to the fiber axis, coupling light into cladding modes. This makes them highly sensitive to the surrounding refractive index (SRI), useful for biochemical sensing [cite: 15, 16].\n*   **Long Period Gratings (LPG):** These have a much longer period (100s of $\\mu m$) and couple core modes to co-propagating cladding modes, offering high sensitivity to external environmental changes but lower strain sensitivity compared to FBGs [cite: 1, 14]."

While studying nonlinear effects in germanium-doped silica fibers using an argon-ion laser, they observed a permanent increase in the refractive index, forming a standing wave pattern. This resulted in the first \"Hill gratings\" [cite: 17, 18]. However, these gratings could only reflect the wavelength of light used to create them, severely limiting their utility."

They utilized two interfering ultraviolet (UV) laser beams incident from the side of the fiber to create the interference pattern. This technique allowed for the inscription of gratings at any desired wavelength by adjusting the angle between the UV beams [cite: 1, 17, 18]. This breakthrough decoupled the writing wavelength from the sensing wavelength, paving the way for the mass production of FBGs for telecommunications (specifically Wavelength Division Multiplexing or WDM) and sensing."

More recently, **femtosecond (fs) laser inscription** has revolutionized the field. Unlike UV inscription, which requires photosensitive fibers (often hydrogen-loaded), fs lasers can inscribe gratings in almost any transparent material, including pure silica and sapphire fibers, through non-linear multiphoton absorption. This allows for \"through-coating\" inscription, where gratings are written without stripping the fiber's protective polymer coating, significantly retaining the mechanical strength of the sensor [cite: 3, 20]."
