This paper provides a comprehensive systematic literature review, revisiting the foundational promise of ML in seismic applications and evaluating its current realization. While early adoption focused on basic regression and classification for hazard analysis, the state-of-the-art has rapidly evolved toward Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Generative AI (diffusion models), and Foundation Models (e.g., SeisLM). This review critically analyzes applications across seismic hazard assessment, ground motion synthesis, structural health monitoring, and post-disaster response. It identifies a critical transition from \"black-box\" predictions to interpretable, physics-consistent simulations. Despite significant milestones, challenges regarding data scarcity, generalization, and trust remain. The paper concludes that while the promise of ML is being fulfilled, the future lies in synergistic frameworks that fuse domain knowledge with the scalability of foundation models.\n\n---"

      "content": "Earthquake engineering has traditionally relied on mechanics-based simulations and empirical correlations derived from historical data. While these methods have successfully underpinned modern building codes and safety standards, they face inherent limitations. Physics-based models, such as Nonlinear Time History Analysis (NLTHA), are computationally expensive and often rely on idealized assumptions about material behavior and boundary conditions [cite: 1, 2]. Conversely, empirical models, such as Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs), often struggle to capture the complex, high-dimensional non-linearities of seismic wave propagation and site-specific structural responses [cite: 3, 4].\n\nThe motivation for implementing Machine Learning (ML) in this domain stems from its ability to handle vast datasets, identify latent non-linear patterns, and serve as rapid surrogate models for complex simulations. As articulated in the seminal review by Xie et al. (2020), ML offers the \"promise\" of enhancing computational efficiency, treating uncertainties more robustly, and facilitating near-real-time decision-making [cite: 5, 6]. Since that publication, the field has witnessed an explosion of interest, driven by the proliferation of seismic data and advancements in algorithmic architecture, particularly in Deep Learning (DL) and Generative AI [cite: 7, 8]."
