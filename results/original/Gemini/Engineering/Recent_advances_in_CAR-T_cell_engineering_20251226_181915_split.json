      "content": "Adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) has emerged as a pillar of modern oncology, with Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy representing its most transformative modality. First conceptualized in the late 1980s and achieving FDA approval in 2017, CAR-T therapy involves the genetic modification of a patient’s T lymphocytes to express a synthetic receptor that redirects specificity toward a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) independent of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) presentation [cite: 11, 12].\n\nWhile the initial success of anti-CD19 CAR-T therapies in B-cell malignancies—such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)—was unprecedented, the translation of this efficacy to solid tumors has historically been hindered by physical barriers, antigen heterogeneity, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) [cite: 13, 14]. Furthermore, the logistical complexity and high cost of autologous manufacturing have limited patient access [cite: 15].\n\nThis systematic review synthesizes literature from 2024 and 2025 to analyze the \"next generation\" of CAR-T engineering. It moves beyond the established paradigms of hematological efficacy to explore novel structural designs, gene-editing enhancements (CRISPR/Cas9), logic-gated safety switches, and emerging applications in autoimmune diseases and senolysis."

These exhibited poor persistence and minimal clinical efficacy [cite: 17].\n    *   **Second-Generation:** Incorporated a co-stimulatory domain (e.g., CD28 or 4-1BB) alongside CD3$\\zeta$. This is the standard for currently approved therapies like axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel, providing necessary signals for proliferation and survival [cite: 11, 18].\n    *   **Third-Generation:** Utilize two distinct co-stimulatory domains (e.g., CD28 and 4-1BB) to combine rapid effector function with long-term persistence [cite: 16].\n    *   **Fourth-Generation (TRUCKs):** \"T cells Redirected for Universal Cytokine-mediated Killing.\" These are engineered to secrete transgenic cytokines (e.g., IL-12) upon antigen binding to remodel the TME and recruit innate immune cells [cite: 17, 19].\n    *   **Fifth-Generation:** Incorporate intracellular domains of cytokine receptors (e.g., IL-2R$\\beta$) to trigger JAK/STAT signaling pathways, mimicking physiological T-cell activation more closely than previous iterations [cite: 18, 20]."

This represents the first randomized positive trial for CAR-T in solid tumors, with an objective response rate (ORR) of 42.9% in high-dose cohorts [cite: 1, 29, 30].\n\n*   **Glioblastoma (GBM):**\n    Intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivery of bivalent CAR-T cells targeting **EGFR and IL13R$\\alpha$2** has shown feasibility and safety. By delivering cells directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, researchers overcame the blood-brain barrier.
