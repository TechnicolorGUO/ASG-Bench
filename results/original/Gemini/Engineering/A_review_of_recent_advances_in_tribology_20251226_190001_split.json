However, the period of 2024–2025 marks a significant inflection point where the discipline is being reshaped by global sustainability mandates and the fourth industrial revolution. This systematic literature review synthesizes recent breakthroughs across four primary domains: **Green Tribology**, **Tribo-informatics**, **Electric Vehicle (EV) Lubrication**, and **Macroscale Superlubricity**. We analyze the transition from petroleum-based lubricants to bio-derived alternatives, specifically highlighting the upcycling of biomass (lignin and nanocellulose) into high-performance additives. We critically examine the rapid maturation of \"E-fluids\" designed for the unique electrical and thermal environments of EV powertrains. Furthermore, we explore the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in predicting tribological behavior, a development that is accelerating material discovery. Finally, we address persistent challenges such as White Etching Cracks (WEC) in wind turbines and the scalability of superlubricity. This review aims to provide a rigorous state-of-the-art assessment for researchers and practitioners navigating this dynamic landscape.\n\n---"

      "content": "Tribology—encompassing friction, wear, and lubrication—is a cornerstone of energy efficiency. It is estimated that approximately 23% of the world’s total energy consumption originates from tribological contacts, with 20% used to overcome friction and 3% to remediate wear-related failures [cite: 1]. Consequently, recent advances in this field are not merely technical refinements but are critical to global decarbonization efforts.\n\nIn 2024 and 2025, the research landscape has shifted dramatically. The traditional focus on extending component life has expanded to include \"Green Tribology,\" which emphasizes ecological balance, biodegradability, and energy conservation [cite: 2, 3]. Simultaneously, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given rise to \"Tribo-informatics,\" allowing for the handling of massive datasets to predict complex non-linear tribological phenomena [cite: 4, 5].\n\nThis review is motivated by the need to consolidate these rapid developments. While classical tribology focused on hydrodynamic lubrication and metallic wear, the current state-of-the-art involves dielectric fluids for electrified powertrains, hydrogels for soft robotics, and atomic-scale manipulation to achieve superlubricity on macroscale steel surfaces.\n\n---"

It involves the use of biodegradable lubricants, biomimetic surfaces, and systems designed to minimize energy loss and emissions [cite: 2, 6].\n*   **Superlubricity:** A state in which the coefficient of friction (COF) drops below 0.01 (and often below 0.001). While traditionally achieved at the nanoscale (structural superlubricity), recent work focuses on **Macroscale Superlubricity**, achieving these regimes on engineering scales under ambient conditions [cite: 7, 8].\n*   **Tribo-informatics:** The application of data science, machine learning, and neural networks to tribological data. This includes **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**, which combine data-driven models with physical laws (e.g., Navier-Stokes equations) to improve prediction accuracy in lubrication problems [cite: 5, 9].\n*   **Tribotronics:** An emerging field that couples triboelectricity with semiconductor electronics. It utilizes the electrostatic potential created by friction (tribo-potential) to gate and control charge carrier transport in transistors, enabling self-powered active mechanosensation [cite: 10, 11].\n*   **E-Fluids:** Specialized lubricants for Electric Vehicles (EVs) that must possess specific dielectric (insulating) properties, high thermal conductivity for cooling, and compatibility with copper components and polymers, in addition to traditional lubrication functions [cite: 12, 13].\n\n---"

The 20th century saw the development of elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) and the synthesis of additives (ZDDP) that defined the automotive era.\n\nThe early 21st century introduced **Nanotribology**, enabled by the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), allowing researchers to understand single-asperity contacts. However, the milestone of the 2020s, and specifically the 2024-2025 period, is the **integration of the digital and physical realms**. The field has moved from *observing* friction to *actively tuning* it via smart materials and predicting it via AI [cite: 4, 14]. Another significant recent milestone is the shift in focus from Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) tribology to EV tribology, necessitating a complete reformulation of lubricant chemistry standards established over the last century [cite: 15].\n\n---"
