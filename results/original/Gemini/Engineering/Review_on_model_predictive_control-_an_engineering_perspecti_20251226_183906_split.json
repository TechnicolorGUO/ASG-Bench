      "content": "Model Predictive Control (MPC) represents a paradigm shift in control engineering, moving from reactive feedback mechanisms to proactive, optimization-based strategies. Unlike classical Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, MPC utilizes a mathematical model of the system to predict future behavior and optimizes a sequence of control actions to satisfy performance criteria and operating constraints. This review provides a comprehensive engineering perspective on MPC, tracing its trajectory from industrial process control in the 1970s to modern applications in agile robotics and autonomous vehicles. We critically analyze the transition from linear, unconstrained formulations to contemporary nonlinear, stochastic, and data-driven methods. Special emphasis is placed on the \"engineering\" reality: the implementation challenges on embedded hardware, the trade-offs between model accuracy and computational speed, and the integration of machine learning to address modeling uncertainties. By synthesizing literature from 1976 to 2025, this paper identifies the current state-of-the-art, highlights the persistent gap between theoretical stability and practical robustness, and outlines future research directions necessary to make MPC ubiquitous in cyber-physical systems.\n\n---"

      "content": "The landscape of industrial control systems has long been dominated by the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller due to its simplicity and ease of tuning. However, modern engineering systems—ranging from renewable energy grids to quadrupedal robots—exhibit complex dynamics, strong interactions between variables, and strict safety constraints that exceed the capabilities of classical feedback loops [cite: 1, 2]. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as the premier advanced control methodology capable of addressing these challenges.\n\nMPC is not a specific algorithm but a family of control methods that make use of a process model to predict the future evolution of the system [cite: 1]. By solving a constrained optimization problem at each sampling instant, MPC determines the optimal control inputs that minimize a cost function (typically tracking error and energy expenditure) while strictly adhering to system limitations, such as actuator saturation or safety boundaries [cite: 3, 4].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the rapid diversification of MPC applications. While early reviews focused heavily on chemical process control, the \"engineering perspective\" has shifted significantly in the last decade. The availability of powerful embedded processors and efficient numerical solvers has pushed MPC into millisecond and microsecond domains, such as power electronics and automotive powertrain control [cite: 5, 6]. Furthermore, the intersection of control theory and artificial intelligence has given rise to learning-based MPC, a frontier that promises to resolve the longstanding bottleneck of model identification [cite: 7, 8].\n\nThis paper aims to provide a rigorous, systematic review of MPC with a focus on practical engineering implementation. It covers the theoretical foundations, historical milestones, and the latest 2024-2025 advancements in data-driven and distributed MPC. It further scrutinizes the practical barriers to adoption, such as computational latency and hardware constraints, offering a roadmap for future developments in the field.\n\n---"

An optimization problem is solved to find a sequence of control actions over a control horizon \\( N_c \\) (where \\( N_c \\leq N_p \\)) that minimizes a cost function. Crucially, only the first element of this optimal sequence is applied to the plant. At the next time step \\( t+1 \\), the system state is measured or estimated, the horizon shifts forward by one step, and the optimization is repeated [cite: 3, 9]. This iterative process allows the controller to compensate for disturbances and modeling errors effectively."
