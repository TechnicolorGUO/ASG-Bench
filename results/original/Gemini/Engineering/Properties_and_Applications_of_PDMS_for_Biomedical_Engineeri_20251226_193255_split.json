This review provides a systematic analysis of the physicochemical properties that render PDMS suitable for biomedical applications, including its hyperelasticity, biocompatibility, and gas permeability. We trace the historical trajectory of PDMS from its industrial origins to its revolutionizing role in soft lithography. The review critically examines state-of-the-art fabrication techniques, moving beyond traditional replica molding to explore 3D printing and advanced surface modifications. We present comprehensive case studies on applications ranging from hemodynamic biomodels to COVID-19 drug screening platforms. Furthermore, this paper offers a rigorous critique of the material's limitations—specifically the absorption of small molecules and hydrophobic recovery—and discusses the regulatory and translational hurdles impeding commercialization. We conclude by identifying research gaps and proposing future directions, including the development of biodegradable alternatives and hybrid manufacturing processes."

      "content": "The intersection of materials science and biomedical engineering has long sought substrates that mimic the mechanical compliance of biological tissues while maintaining the robustness required for engineering analysis. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a silicon-based organic polymer, has emerged as the *de facto* standard for microfluidic prototyping and soft tissue modeling [cite: 1, 2]. Its rise to prominence, particularly following the advent of soft lithography in the late 1990s, fundamentally altered the landscape of Bio-MEMS (Biomedical Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems), shifting the focus from rigid silicon and glass substrates to elastomeric polymers [cite: 3, 4].\n\nThe motivation for the widespread adoption of PDMS lies in its unique constellation of properties: it is optically transparent, allowing for real-time microscopy; it is permeable to gases, essential for cell culture respiration; and it is mechanically tunable, capable of mimicking the stiffness of various soft tissues [cite: 5]. However, the translation of PDMS-based devices from academic laboratories to clinical and pharmaceutical settings has been slower than anticipated. This retardation is largely due to material-specific drawbacks, such as the absorption of hydrophobic drugs and surface instability, which complicate quantitative bioassays and long-term implantation [cite: 6, 7].\n\nThis review aims to provide a comprehensive, critical analysis of PDMS in biomedical engineering. Unlike previous reviews that may focus solely on microfluidics or implants, this paper synthesizes the material's properties with its diverse applications, while rigorously addressing the translational bottlenecks that currently challenge the field."

      "content": "PDMS is a mineral-organic polymer (silicone) belonging to the siloxane family. Its backbone consists of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms, with two methyl groups ($-CH_3$) attached to each silicon atom. The material is typically supplied as a two-part system: a base (vinyl-terminated siloxane) and a curing agent (crosslinker containing silicon hydride bonds) [cite: 8, 9].\n\nThe curing process, typically a hydrosilylation reaction catalyzed by platinum, transforms the liquid pre-polymer into a solid elastomer. The mechanical properties of the resulting bulk material can be tuned by altering the base-to-curing agent ratio. The standard ratio is 10:1, but variations (e.g., 5:1 to 20:1) allow researchers to adjust the Young's modulus to match specific tissue types [cite: 10, 11]."

This low modulus allows PDMS to conform to non-planar surfaces and mimic soft tissues [cite: 5].\n*   **Gas Permeability:** The porous structure of the siloxane network allows for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide, a vital feature for maintaining cell viability in closed microfluidic channels [cite: 12, 13].\n*   **Hydrophobicity:** Native PDMS is hydrophobic, with a water contact angle (WCA) of approximately $108^\\circ \\pm 7^\\circ$. This property drives non-specific protein adsorption and complicates the filling of microchannels with aqueous solutions [cite: 4, 5]."

This set of techniques, including replica molding (REM) and microcontact printing ($\\mu$CP), utilized PDMS stamps to pattern materials on the micro- and nanoscale [cite: 3, 15].\n\nPrior to this, microfluidic devices were primarily fabricated using silicon etching techniques derived from the semiconductor industry. These methods were expensive, required cleanroom facilities, and produced opaque, rigid devices unsuitable for cell culture. Soft lithography democratized microfabrication, allowing laboratories to rapidly prototype devices using PDMS molds cast against a master (usually SU-8 photoresist on silicon) [cite: 2, 8]."

This also enables irreversible bonding to glass or other PDMS layers. However, this effect is temporary due to \"hydrophobic recovery\" [cite: 1, 19].\n*   **Chemical Functionalization:** Techniques such as silanization, layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition, and the use of amphiphilic block copolymers (e.g., Pluronic F127) are employed to create stable hydrophilic coatings that resist protein fouling [cite: 4, 20].\n*   **UV/Ozone Treatment:** A slower but gentler alternative to plasma, UV/ozone treatment oxidizes the surface and can be used to modulate wettability with high precision [cite: 21]."

Recent studies have utilized fumed silica-PDMS suspensions to improve rheological properties for extrusion printing [cite: 22].\n*   **3D Printed Molds:** Instead of expensive photolithography, researchers are increasingly using high-resolution stereolithography (SLA) or digital light processing (DLP) 3D printers to create the master molds for PDMS casting. This significantly reduces the cost and time for prototyping [cite: 6, 23]."

A human lung airway chip, consisting of differentiated bronchial epithelium and pulmonary endothelium separated by a porous PDMS membrane, was used to model viral infection and screen therapeutics like amodiaquine. These models successfully recapitulated host-immune responses and alveolar barrier damage, offering a humane alternative to animal testing [cite: 24, 25, 26].\n*   **Gut-on-a-Chip:** PDMS devices have been used to co-culture intestinal epithelial cells with mucin-secreting cells under shear stress, simulating the peristaltic motion of the gut.

This phenomenon acts as a \"chemical sink,\" significantly reducing the effective concentration of drugs in microfluidic channels and skewing dose-response curves.\n*   **Mechanism:** The porous, hydrophobic network of PDMS allows small molecules to diffuse into the bulk polymer. The extent of absorption correlates with the molecule's octanol-water partition coefficient (Log P) [cite: 6, 29].\n*   **Impact:** In drug screening applications (e.g., testing antimalarial drugs like amodiaquine), this absorption can lead to underestimation of drug potency or toxicity. Computational models and experimental corrections are often required to account for this loss, adding complexity to bioassays [cite: 7, 30]."

Its optical clarity, gas permeability, and ease of fabrication have fueled the explosion of microfluidics and Organ-on-a-Chip technologies, enabling breakthroughs in disease modeling and fundamental biology. However, the \"sponge-like\" absorption of small molecules and surface instability present formidable challenges for pharmaceutical applications.\n\nThe future of PDMS lies in its evolution. Through advanced surface engineering, hybrid material integration, and novel fabrication methods like 3D printing, engineers are finding ways to mitigate its flaws while leveraging its strengths. While biodegradable alternatives may eventually replace PDMS in implantable applications, it is likely to remain the workhorse of *in vitro* biomedical engineering for the foreseeable future."
