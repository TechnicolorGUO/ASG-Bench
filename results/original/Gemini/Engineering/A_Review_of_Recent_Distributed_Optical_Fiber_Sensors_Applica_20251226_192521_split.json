      "content": "Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is critical for ensuring the safety, longevity, and resilience of civil infrastructure. Traditional monitoring methods, relying on discrete point sensors, often fail to capture localized damage or global deformation trends in large-scale structures. Distributed Optical Fiber Sensors (DOFS) have emerged as a transformative technology, enabling continuous, real-time measurement of strain, temperature, and vibration along fiber lengths ranging from meters to over 100 kilometers. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent DOFS applications in civil engineering, focusing on developments from 2015 to 2024. We examine the fundamental principles of Rayleigh, Brillouin, and Raman scattering, and their implementation in state-of-the-art interrogation systems. Detailed case studies are presented, covering crack detection in bridges, convergence monitoring in tunnels, landslide detection in geotechnical engineering, and leak detection in pipelines. Furthermore, the review critically analyzes current challenges, including strain transfer mechanisms and data processing, and identifies future research directions such as the integration of DOFS with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Twins."

      "content": "The deterioration of civil infrastructure due to aging, environmental loading, and natural hazards presents a significant global challenge. To mitigate catastrophic failures and optimize maintenance strategies, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has become an essential discipline within civil engineering [cite: 1, 2]. Historically, SHM relied on visual inspections and discrete sensors such as electrical resistance strain gauges, accelerometers, or vibrating wire transducers. While effective for localized measurements, these \"point\" sensors cannot detect damage occurring between sensor locations, leaving vast areas of large structures unmonitored [cite: 3, 4].\n\nDistributed Optical Fiber Sensors (DOFS) address this limitation by utilizing the optical fiber itself as the sensing medium. This technology allows for the acquisition of spatially continuous data, effectively providing thousands of sensing points along a single cable [cite: 5, 6]. The advantages of DOFS include immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI), high sensitivity, durability in harsh environments, and the ability to monitor long-distance assets such as pipelines and tunnels [cite: 1, 7].\n\nRecent years have witnessed a surge in DOFS applications, driven by improvements in spatial resolution, measurement range, and interrogation speed. Notably, the shift from static monitoring to dynamic sensing using Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) and the achievement of sub-millimeter spatial resolution using Rayleigh scattering have opened new frontiers in damage detection [cite: 8, 9]. This paper aims to review these recent advancements, categorizing them by application domain and sensing principle, while highlighting the transition from laboratory validation to full-scale field implementation."

      "content": "1.  **Rayleigh Scattering:** This is an elastic scattering process caused by random density fluctuations and refractive index variations frozen into the fiber core during manufacturing. It is sensitive to both strain and temperature. Techniques based on Rayleigh scattering, such as Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR) and Phase-Sensitive Optical Time Domain Reflectometry ($\\phi$-OTDR), offer the highest spatial resolution (down to millimeters) and are increasingly used for dynamic acoustic sensing (DAS) [cite: 3, 10, 11].\n2.  **Brillouin Scattering:** This inelastic scattering arises from the interaction between the incident light and acoustic phonons (sound waves) in the fiber. The frequency shift of the backscattered light (Brillouin Frequency Shift, BFS) is linearly proportional to both strain and temperature. This mechanism is the basis for Brillouin Optical Time Domain Analysis (BOTDA) and Reflectometry (BOTDR), which are ideal for long-range monitoring (tens of kilometers) [cite: 5, 6, 12].\n3.  **Raman Scattering:** This inelastic scattering is caused by the interaction of light with molecular vibrations. It produces two components: Stokes (weakly temperature-dependent) and anti-Stokes (strongly temperature-dependent). Raman systems are used almost exclusively for Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and are insensitive to mechanical strain [cite: 13, 14]."

      "content": "*   **OTDR (Optical Time Domain Reflectometry):** Uses light pulses to determine the location of events based on the time-of-flight. Spatial resolution is determined by pulse width [cite: 1].\n*   **OFDR (Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry):** Uses a swept-wavelength laser and interferometry. It provides exceptionally high spatial resolution (sub-millimeter) over shorter ranges (<100m), making it ideal for crack detection in concrete [cite: 4, 10].\n*   **BOTDA vs. BOTDR:** BOTDA requires access to both ends of the fiber (loop configuration) and uses stimulated scattering for higher accuracy. BOTDR requires only single-end access (spontaneous scattering), making it more practical for field installation despite lower signal strength [cite: 12, 15]."

While accurate, FBGs are quasi-distributed (point) sensors, requiring multiplexing to cover large areas [cite: 4, 16].\n*   **2000s - Brillouin Sensing Maturity:** The commercialization of BOTDA and BOTDR systems allowed for the first large-scale monitoring of dams and pipelines. A significant milestone was achieved in 2006 with the demonstration of Brillouin-based sensing over a 100 km range [cite: 17, 18].\n*   **2010s - High-Resolution Rayleigh:** The refinement of OFDR allowed for \"hair-thin\" sensing capable of detecting micro-cracks, bridging the gap between global monitoring and local damage detection [cite: 10, 19].\n*   **2020s - Dynamic and Intelligent Sensing:** The current era is defined by the adoption of DAS for real-time traffic and seismic monitoring, and the integration of DOFS data with AI and Digital Twins [cite: 2, 8]."

The system not only monitored structural vibrations but also successfully identified individual vehicles, estimating their speed and mass based on the dynamic strain response [cite: 8, 23, 24].\n*   **Seismic Monitoring:** In Taiwan, a 1 km span of a high-speed railway bridge was instrumented with strain-sensing fibers. Following earthquakes of magnitude 6.4 and 6.8 in 2022, the system provided immediate safety confirmation by comparing pre- and post-seismic deformation profiles [cite: 25, 26]."

      "content": "Despite the successes, several challenges hinder the widespread adoption of DOFS:\n\n1.  **Strain Transfer and Coating:** The accuracy of strain measurement depends heavily on the transfer of stress from the host structure to the fiber core. Soft coatings (acrylate) dampen the signal, while stiff coatings (polyimide) provide better transfer but are more brittle. The selection of adhesives and installation methods remains a critical variable [cite: 4, 32, 33].\n2.  **Temperature Compensation:** Distinguishing between mechanical strain and thermal expansion is a persistent issue, particularly for Brillouin and Rayleigh systems. While hybrid methods exist, they add complexity and cost [cite: 15, 34].\n3.  **Data Management:** DAS systems generate massive datasets (terabytes per day). Storing, processing, and extracting actionable insights from this \"big data\" in real-time is a significant computational bottleneck [cite: 2, 35].\n4.  **Durability and Installation:** Optical fibers are fragile. Ensuring their survival during the harsh construction process (e.g., concrete pouring) requires robust cabling (e.g., steel-armored cables), which can conversely affect strain sensitivity [cite: 3, 36, 37]."

This includes automated vehicle classification and anomaly detection in real-time [cite: 2, 38, 39].\n*   **Digital Twins:** DOFS data is increasingly being fed into Digital Twins—virtual replicas of physical structures. This allows for continuous model updating and predictive maintenance based on real-time distributed data [cite: 25, 40].\n*   **Smart Textiles:** To simplify installation, researchers are developing \"smart textiles\" where optical fibers are woven into fabric patches. These can be easily glued to structures to monitor cracking without complex cabling [cite: 9, 41].\n*   **Standardization:** The lack of standardized guidelines has been a barrier. Recent efforts, such as the 2021 DFOS manual by the Photonic Sensing Consortium (PhoSC), aim to standardize installation and data interpretation practices [cite: 15]."
