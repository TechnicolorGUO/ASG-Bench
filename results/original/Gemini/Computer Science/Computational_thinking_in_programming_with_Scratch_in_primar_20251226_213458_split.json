      "content": "**Background:** As digital literacy becomes a prerequisite for the 21st-century workforce, educational systems worldwide are integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into primary school curricula. Scratch, a visual block-based programming environment, has emerged as the primary pedagogical tool for this demographic.\n**Objective:** This systematic literature review examines the state of research regarding the development and assessment of CT skills using Scratch in primary education (K-9).\n**Method:** A comprehensive analysis of empirical studies, theoretical frameworks, and case studies was conducted to identify key themes, methodologies, and findings.\n**Results:** The review identifies that while Scratch effectively lowers the barrier to programming, the definition and assessment of CT remain fragmented. The Brennan and Resnick (2012) framework is the most widely adopted theoretical lens. Assessment methods have evolved from manual code inspection to automated static analysis (e.g., Dr. Scratch) and data-driven process mining.\n**Conclusion:** Scratch is effective for fostering algorithmic thinking and creativity. However, significant gaps remain regarding the transferability of skills to non-computing domains, the long-term retention of CT concepts, and the effective professional development of teachers."

      "content": "The digitization of modern society has necessitated the inclusion of computer science concepts in compulsory education. At the forefront of this educational shift is the concept of Computational Thinking (CT), a term popularized by Wing (2006) to describe the problem-solving processes involved in formulating problems so their solutions can be represented as computational steps and algorithms [cite: 1]. In primary education, the challenge has been to introduce these abstract concepts in a developmentally appropriate manner.\n\nScratch, developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab, has become the de facto standard for introducing programming to young children [cite: 2, 3]. Its \"low floor\" (easy to get started) and \"high ceiling\" (ability to create complex projects) make it an ideal environment for fostering CT [cite: 4]. Unlike text-based languages, Scratch eliminates syntax errors through a block-based interface, allowing students to focus on logic and design [cite: 5].\n\nDespite its popularity, the educational objectives of CT in primary schools remain somewhat unclear, with curricula often conflating digital literacy with computational thinking [cite: 6]. Furthermore, there is a lack of consensus on how to assess CT effectively. While some educators focus on the final code artifact, others emphasize the iterative design process [cite: 7]. This review aims to synthesize existing literature to provide a comprehensive overview of how Scratch is used to teach and assess CT, highlighting historical milestones, current methodologies, and future research directions."

CT is generally understood not just as programming, but as a set of thinking skills including abstraction, decomposition, pattern recognition, and algorithmic design [cite: 1]. In the context of Scratch, these skills are manifested through the manipulation of media and logic blocks to create interactive stories, games, and animations [cite: 8]."

This framework categorizes CT into three dimensions:\n1.  **Computational Concepts:** The concepts designers use as they program, such as sequences, loops, parallelism, events, conditionals, operators, and data [cite: 2, 9].\n2.  **Computational Practices:** The problem-solving practices that occur during programming, including experimenting and iterating, testing and debugging, reusing and remixing, and abstracting and modularizing [cite: 2, 7].\n3.  **Computational Perspectives:** The shifts in perspective that learners experience, such as expressing oneself through technology, connecting with others, and questioning the technological world [cite: 2, 9]."

Evidence suggests that Scratch is particularly effective when integrated into existing subjects like mathematics and when used to create games or stories that resonate with students' personal interests.\n\nHowever, challenges remain. The assessment of \"thinking\" rather than just \"coding\" is an ongoing struggle, and the professional development of teachers lags behind the adoption of the tools. Furthermore, the promise of CT as a universal problem-solving skill requires more robust evidence regarding transferability. As the field evolves, the integration of AI extensions and the use of data-driven learning analytics will likely define the next generation of research in primary school computing education."
