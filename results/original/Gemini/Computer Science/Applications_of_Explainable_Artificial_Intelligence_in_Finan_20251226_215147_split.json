      "content": "The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the financial sector has unlocked unprecedented predictive capabilities but has simultaneously introduced significant risks regarding opacity, bias, and lack of accountability. This \"black box\" problem has necessitated the rise of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review of XAI applications in finance, synthesizing findings from Finance, Information Systems (IS), and Computer Science (CS) disciplines. We analyze the historical evolution of the field, the current state-of-the-art methods (such as SHAP and LIME), and key application areas including credit scoring, fraud detection, and algorithmic trading. Furthermore, we critically examine the regulatory landscape, particularly the impact of the EU AI Act and GDPR, and the socio-technical challenges of user trust. The review identifies a critical gap in causal inference and the under-utilization of XAI in anti-money laundering (AML). We conclude by outlining a research agenda that bridges the gap between algorithmic transparency and human-centric decision-making."

      "content": "The financial services industry is currently undergoing a paradigm shift driven by digitalization and the adoption of advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques [cite: 1, 2]. These technologies offer superior performance in tasks such as credit scoring, fraud detection, and market forecasting compared to traditional statistical methods. However, the complexity of these models—often referred to as \"black boxes\"—obscures the internal logic behind their predictions [cite: 3, 4].\n\nIn highly regulated domains like finance, the inability to explain a decision is a critical failure point. Stakeholders, including regulators, loan officers, and customers, require transparency to ensure fairness, accountability, and compliance [cite: 1, 5]. This tension between predictive performance and interpretability has given rise to the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). While Computer Science literature focuses on the development of explanation algorithms, and Finance literature focuses on domain-specific accuracy, Information Systems (IS) literature addresses the crucial aspect of user acceptance and trust [cite: 6, 7]."

To define and categorize key XAI concepts relevant to financial applications.\n2.  To map the historical development and milestones of AI in finance leading to the XAI necessity.\n3.  To evaluate state-of-the-art XAI methods and their specific utility in financial tasks.\n4.  To identify regulatory, technical, and adoption challenges, including the impact of the EU AI Act.\n5.

Models like linear regression and decision trees are considered inherently interpretable (or \"white-box\") because their internal mechanics are transparent [cite: 3, 8].\n\n**Explainability**, in contrast, typically refers to post-hoc methods applied to complex \"black-box\" models (like Deep Neural Networks or Random Forests) to approximate or visualize their decision-making process in human-understandable terms [cite: 8, 9]. XAI seeks to bridge the cognitive gap between the mathematical operations of the model and the reasoning required by human users [cite: 6]."

The convergence of high-performance \"black box\" algorithms with stringent regulations like the EU AI Act has made XAI indispensable.\n\nWhile methods like SHAP and LIME have become industry standards for credit risk and fraud detection, significant challenges remain regarding the fidelity-interpretability trade-off and the stability of explanations. The literature suggests a future trajectory moving away from purely correlational, post-hoc explanations toward **Causal AI** and **Generative AI** interfaces that offer intuitive, dialogue-based transparency.\n\nFor researchers in Computer Science, the challenge lies in developing more stable and causal explanation methods. For Finance scholars, the focus must be on applying these tools to understudied areas like AML and systemic risk. Finally, for Information Systems researchers, the priority is to design user-centric interfaces that foster genuine trust and facilitate effective Human-AI collaboration. As finance becomes increasingly algorithmic, XAI will serve as the essential bridge ensuring that these systems remain fair, accountable, and intelligible to the humans they serve."
