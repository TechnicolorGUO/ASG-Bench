By employing a minimax game theoretic framework between a generator and a discriminator, GANs are capable of synthesizing high-fidelity data distributions without explicit density estimation. This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive analysis of the field as of early 2025. We examine the theoretical underpinnings of adversarial training, tracing the evolution from the original vanilla GAN to stabilized architectures like Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) and StyleGAN. A critical focus is placed on the \"Diffusion vs. GAN\" narrative, culminating in the analysis of the 2025 breakthrough **R3GAN**, which signals a renaissance in GAN research by outperforming diffusion models in efficiency while matching quality. Furthermore, we explore high-impact applications in medical imaging (GIST), financial time-series modeling (MiT-WGAN), and creative industries. The review concludes with a critical discussion of open problems, including mode collapse, evaluation metric limitations (FID vs. IS), and the ethical imperatives surrounding deepfakes.\n\n---"

      "content": "The domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed a paradigm shift with the advent of generative modeling, a field dedicated to learning the underlying distribution of data to generate new, plausible samples. Among the various approaches, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014, represent a radical departure from maximum likelihood estimation methods [cite: 1, 2]. Unlike Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) which optimize a lower bound on the log-likelihood, GANs utilize an adversarial process where two neural networks compete: a **Generator ($G$)** that creates synthetic data, and a **Discriminator ($D$)** that attempts to distinguish between real and synthetic data [cite: 3, 4]."

However, the period between 2021 and 2024 saw a migration of research interest toward Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), which offered greater training stability and diversity [cite: 5, 6]. By 2024, a prevailing sentiment in the community was that \"GANs are dead\" regarding SOTA image generation [cite: 7, 8].\n\nHowever, 2025 has marked a pivotal turning point. New research argues that the perceived limitations of GANs were not inherent flaws but rather consequences of outdated architectures and optimization tricks. The introduction of models like **R3GAN** has demonstrated that modernized GANs can match diffusion models in quality while retaining their primary advantage: single-step inference speed [cite: 8, 9]. This review is motivated by the need to synthesize this rapid evolution, bridging the gap between foundational GAN theory and the emerging \"post-diffusion\" GAN renaissance."

Its goal is to capture the data distribution $p_{data}$.\n*   **The Discriminator ($D$):** Outputs a single scalar representing the probability that an input $x$ came from the real data rather than $G$.\n\nThe training process is formulated as a minimax game with the following value function $V(G, D)$:\n\\[\n\\min_G \\max_D V(D, G) = \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_{data}(x)} [\\log D(x)] + \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p_z(z)} [\\log(1 - D(G(z)))]\n\\]\nIn this game, $D$ tries to maximize the probability of correctly classifying real and fake images, while $G$ tries to minimize $\\log(1 - D(G(z)))$ (or practically, maximize $\\log D(G(z))$ to avoid vanishing gradients) [cite: 4, 10, 11]."

This theoretical limitation spurred the development of alternative distance metrics, most notably the **Wasserstein distance** (Earth Mover’s distance), which provides smoother gradients even when distributions do not overlap [cite: 10, 11]."

It calculates the KL-divergence between the conditional class distribution and the marginal class distribution [cite: 14, 15].\n2.  **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID):** Currently the gold standard, FID compares the statistics (mean and covariance) of feature vectors from real and generated images. A lower FID indicates that the generated distribution is statistically closer to the real distribution. FID is generally considered more robust than IS as it accounts for the real data distribution [cite: 14, 16, 17].\n\n---"
