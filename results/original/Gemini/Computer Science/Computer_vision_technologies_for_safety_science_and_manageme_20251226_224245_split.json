Traditional safety management, reliant on manual inspection and retrospective reporting, often fails to prevent incidents in real-time. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review of computer vision (CV) technologies applied to construction safety science and management. We analyze the evolution of the field from early image processing to state-of-the-art Deep Learning architectures, including YOLOv8 and Vision Transformers (ViT). The review categorizes existing literature into three developmental levels: detection, assessment, and prediction. While significant maturity has been achieved in object detection (e.g., PPE compliance), the field faces challenges regarding data scarcity, occlusion, and integration with safety management systems. We critically examine the emergence of Generative AI for synthetic data creation and the integration of CV with Building Information Modeling (BIM). Finally, we propose a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the need for predictive models that incorporate safety culture and behavioral psychology."

      "content": "The construction industry is a cornerstone of global economic development but is plagued by a disproportionately high rate of occupational injuries and fatalities. In the United States alone, construction accounted for 20% of all work-related fatalities in 2024, with the \"Fatal Four\"—falls, struck-by incidents, electrocutions, and caught-between incidents—comprising over 60% of these deaths [cite: 1, 2]. Traditional safety management systems (SMS) rely heavily on manual observations, checklists, and post-accident investigations. These methods are inherently labor-intensive, prone to human error, and reactive rather than proactive [cite: 1, 3].\n\nThe advent of Industry 4.0 has introduced digital technologies to mitigate these risks. Among these, Computer Vision (CV)—a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to interpret visual data—has emerged as a transformative tool for safety science. By leveraging cameras and deep learning algorithms, CV systems can provide continuous, non-intrusive monitoring of construction sites, identifying hazards that human supervisors might miss [cite: 4, 5].\n\nThis paper provides a critical review of CV in construction safety, motivated by the rapid technological advancements seen in 2024 and 2025, particularly the rise of Vision Transformers and Generative AI. The objective is to synthesize current state-of-the-art methods, evaluate their alignment with theoretical safety science, and identify gaps preventing widespread industry adoption."
