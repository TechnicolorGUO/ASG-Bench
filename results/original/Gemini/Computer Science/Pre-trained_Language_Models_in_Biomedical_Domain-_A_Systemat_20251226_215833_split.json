Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have emerged as the *de facto* standard for these tasks, evolving from encoder-only architectures like BERT to massive generative decoders and multimodal systems. This systematic survey reviews the development, taxonomy, and application of PLMs in the biomedical domain. We critically analyze the historical progression from BioBERT and ClinicalBERT to state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Med-PaLM 2 and OpenBioLLM. Furthermore, we examine the shift toward autonomous medical agents and multimodal foundation models. The review identifies significant challenges, particularly regarding model factuality (hallucination), interpretability, and the ethical implications of clinical deployment. We conclude by outlining future research directions, emphasizing the need for robust evaluation metrics that transcend traditional benchmarks to ensure patient safety in real-world settings.\n\n---"

      "content": "Biomedical text mining is a critical discipline at the intersection of bioinformatics, medicine, and computer science. The volume of biomedical literature is expanding exponentially; PubMed alone adds over a million citations annually, and EHRs generate petabytes of unstructured clinical notes [cite: 1, 2]. Traditional NLP methods, relying on rule-based systems or statistical machine learning, struggled to capture the complex semantic dependencies and specialized terminology inherent in biomedical text [cite: 3, 4].\n\nThe advent of the Transformer architecture and the pre-training/fine-tuning paradigm revolutionized this landscape. General-domain models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) demonstrated that models pre-trained on vast corpora could learn universal language representations. However, the direct application of general-domain PLMs to biomedicine often yields suboptimal results due to a phenomenon known as **distribution shift**—the significant difference in word distribution and semantic structure between general web text (e.g., Wikipedia) and biomedical corpora [cite: 1, 5].\n\nThis survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the efforts to bridge this gap. We explore the trajectory from domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT) to the training of domain-specific LLMs from scratch. Unlike previous surveys that focus solely on specific architectures or tasks, this review integrates recent advancements in multimodal learning and autonomous agents (2024–2025), providing a holistic view of the current ecosystem [cite: 6, 7].\n\n---"
