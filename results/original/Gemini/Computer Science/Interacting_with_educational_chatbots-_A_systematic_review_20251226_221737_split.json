      "content": "The integration of conversational agents, or chatbots, into educational settings has witnessed a paradigm shift following the advent of generative artificial intelligence. This systematic literature review examines the landscape of educational chatbots, tracing their trajectory from early pattern-matching systems to state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs). By synthesizing data from over 100 sources, this paper categorizes chatbots based on their pedagogical roles—teaching, peer, teachable, and motivational agents—and analyzes their efficacy in diverse learning environments. Special attention is given to interaction styles, scaffolding techniques, and the implementation of Socratic methods in platforms like Khanmigo and Duolingo Max. While the literature indicates significant potential for scalability and personalized support, critical challenges regarding accuracy, ethics, and the depth of cognitive engagement remain. This review identifies gaps in longitudinal empirical evidence and proposes a research agenda focused on multimodal interaction and ethical governance."

While the benefits of one-on-one tutoring are well-documented (often referred to as Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem), providing human tutors for every student is economically unfeasible [cite: 1, 2]. Chatbots—software applications designed to simulate human conversation—have emerged as a potential solution to this scalability crisis. The release of advanced LLMs, such as GPT-4, has accelerated interest in this field, transforming chatbots from rigid, menu-based tools into dynamic conversational partners capable of complex dialogue [cite: 3, 4]."

To define and classify the pedagogical roles and technical architectures of educational chatbots.\n2.  To trace the historical evolution from rule-based systems to generative AI.\n3.  To critically evaluate state-of-the-art methods, specifically focusing on scaffolding and Socratic interaction.\n4.

Unlike general-purpose assistants (e.g., Siri), educational chatbots are specifically engineered to facilitate learning processes, provide feedback, or support administrative educational tasks [cite: 6, 7]."

      "content": "The literature categorizes chatbots into two primary technical architectures:\n*   **Rule-Based (Pattern Matching):** These systems rely on predefined templates and decision trees (e.g., AIML). They function well for frequently asked questions but fail when users deviate from the script [cite: 8, 9].\n*   **AI-Based (Generative):** Utilizing Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), these bots generate responses dynamically. Modern iterations use Transformer architectures (e.g., GPT) to understand context and intent [cite: 4, 8]."

      "content": "A critical contribution of recent systematic reviews [cite: 10, 11, 12] is the classification of chatbots by their educational function:\n*   **Teaching Agents:** The most common role, where the bot acts as a tutor delivering content, quizzing students, and providing direct feedback [cite: 10, 13].\n*   **Peer Agents:** The bot simulates a fellow student to facilitate collaborative learning or reduce anxiety, often used in language learning contexts [cite: 10, 12].\n*   **Teachable Agents:** Based on the \"learning-by-teaching\" paradigm, these bots allow students to teach the agent. The agent's performance improves as the student explains concepts, reinforcing the student's own understanding [cite: 12, 14, 15].\n*   **Motivational Agents:** Designed to support self-regulation, time management, and emotional well-being rather than delivering curriculum content [cite: 16]."

The release of OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4 (2020–2023) marked the current phase, enabling \"zero-shot\" interactions where chatbots can handle open-domain questions with high fluency, leading to tools like **Khanmigo** and **Duolingo Max** [cite: 2, 25, 26]."

The system retrieves relevant information from this trusted database and uses the LLM only to formulate the response.

The integration of Generative AI has enabled sophisticated roles, from Socratic tutors like Khanmigo to administrative assistants like Jill Watson. However, the field stands at a crossroads. To realize the full potential of this technology, researchers and developers must address the \"hallucination\" problem, ensure robust data privacy, and design interactions that foster deep cognitive engagement rather than passive consumption. The future of educational chatbots lies not in replacing human educators, but in creating a symbiotic ecosystem where AI handles the routine and scalable aspects of instruction, freeing human teachers to focus on mentorship, emotional support, and complex pedagogical guidance."
