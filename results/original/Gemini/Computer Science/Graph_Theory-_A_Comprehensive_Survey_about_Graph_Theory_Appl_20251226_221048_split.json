      "content": "Graph theory, a field originating from a recreational mathematical puzzle in the 18th century, has matured into a cornerstone of modern computational science and sociology. This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive survey of graph theory’s theoretical underpinnings and its extensive applications in computer science (CS) and social networks (SN). We examine the historical trajectory from Euler’s Seven Bridges of Königsberg to the emergence of complex network science and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The review critically analyzes state-of-the-art methods, including traversal algorithms used in navigation systems and centrality measures used in social influence analysis. Detailed case studies of Google Maps and Facebook illustrate the practical scalability of these theories. Furthermore, we identify significant challenges, such as the computational complexity of massive dynamic graphs and the \"black-box\" nature of deep learning on graphs. The paper concludes by outlining future research directions, emphasizing the convergence of symbolic AI (Knowledge Graphs) with subsymbolic AI (Deep Learning) and the necessity for explainable, trustworthy graph intelligence."

In a directed graph (digraph), edges have an orientation, representing asymmetric relationships (e.g., a hyperlink from Page A to Page B) [cite: 1, 8].\n*   **Weighted Graphs:** Edges may carry weights representing cost, distance, or strength of relationship. This is crucial for applications like finding the shortest path in a road network [cite: 3, 9].\n*   **Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs):** Unlike homogeneous graphs where all nodes and edges are of the same type, HINs involve multiple types of objects and relations (e.g., a bibliographic network containing authors, papers, and venues) [cite: 10, 11]."

High betweenness indicates a \"bridge\" or \"gatekeeper\" role, critical for controlling information flow [cite: 6, 7].\n*   **Closeness Centrality:** The inverse of the average shortest path distance from a node to all other nodes. It indicates how quickly a node can spread information to the entire network [cite: 6, 7].\n*   **Eigenvector Centrality:** Assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the concept that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question than equal connections to low-scoring nodes (e.g., Google's PageRank) [cite: 6, 12]."

This was the first instance of \"geometry of position\" (topology), where metric properties like distance were irrelevant compared to connectivity [cite: 17].\nLater, in the mid-19th century, **Gustav Kirchhoff** applied graph theoretic principles to electrical circuits, establishing Kirchhoff’s laws, while **Arthur Cayley** used trees to enumerate chemical isomers, linking graph theory to chemistry [cite: 18, 19]."

They demonstrated that by randomly rewiring a small fraction of edges in a regular lattice, one could create a graph with both high clustering (like a lattice) and short average path lengths (like a random graph), a phenomenon observed in neural networks and social groups [cite: 20, 21]."
