This systematic literature review investigates the multifaceted influence of AI on business value, synthesizing findings from academic research, industry reports, and theoretical frameworks. The review categorizes the literature into three evolutionary waves—predictive, generative, and agentic—and analyzes them through the theoretical lenses of the Resource-Based View (RBV) and Dynamic Capabilities. Key findings indicate that while AI offers substantial potential for operational efficiency, decision-making enhancement, and business model innovation, value realization is often hindered by the \"AI Paradox\"—a gap between investment and measurable return. This paper identifies critical enablers of value, including AI ambidexterity, data governance, and strategic alignment, while highlighting significant challenges such as algorithmic bias, talent shortages, and integration complexities. The review concludes by proposing a research agenda focused on the emerging impact of Agentic AI and the necessity of responsible AI frameworks for sustainable competitive advantage.\n\n---"

      "content": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the fabric of modern enterprise has precipitated a fundamental shift in the conception of business strategy. No longer merely a tool for automation or cost reduction, AI has emerged as a \"general-purpose technology\" capable of reshaping entire industries [cite: 1, 2]. However, a significant dichotomy exists in the current business landscape. While investment in AI is projected to reach trillions of dollars, a substantial portion of organizations struggle to translate these investments into tangible business value—a phenomenon often described as the \"AI Paradox\" or the challenge of \"value realization\" [cite: 3, 4].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the urgent need to bridge the gap between technological capability and strategic utility. As organizations transition from the \"digital era\" to the \"AI era,\" traditional IT strategies are proving insufficient. Leaders require robust frameworks to understand how AI influences value creation not just through efficiency, but through the reconfiguration of business models and the enhancement of dynamic capabilities [cite: 5, 6]."
