      "content": "Corruption in international business (IB) represents one of the most complex and enduring challenges for multinational enterprises (MNEs), policymakers, and scholars. This systematic literature review synthesizes three decades of research to map the intellectual terrain of the field. We analyze the evolution of corruption research from early economic rationalizations to contemporary sociological and institutional perspectives. The review categorizes the literature into key streams: legislative frameworks, determinants of corruption, the \"grease vs. sand\" debate, and the impact on firm internationalization strategies. We critically evaluate state-of-the-art methodologies, highlighting the limitations of perception-based indices and the promise of experimental approaches. Furthermore, we present detailed case studies of landmark scandals—Siemens, Odebrecht, and 1MDB—to illustrate the mechanisms of systemic graft. Finally, we propose a robust future research agenda focused on the intersection of corruption with digitalization, blockchain technology, and the burgeoning ESG movement, identifying critical gaps that demand scholarly attention."

      "content": "Corruption, defined broadly as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain, is a multifaceted phenomenon that permeates political, economic, and social spheres. In the context of International Business (IB), corruption introduces significant uncertainty, alters entry strategies, and affects the operational performance of Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) [cite: 1, 2]. Despite the proliferation of anti-corruption legislation and compliance programs, corruption remains a persistent \"grand challenge,\" with the World Economic Forum estimating the cost of corruption at over US $2.6 trillion annually, or 5% of global GDP [cite: 2].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the fragmentation of the existing literature. While scholars from economics, law, political science, and management have examined corruption, these streams often remain siloed [cite: 3, 4]. Early research largely focused on the macroeconomic determinants of corruption or the \"grease the wheels\" hypothesis. However, recent high-profile scandals involving global conglomerates like Siemens, Airbus, and Glencore have shifted the focus toward the internal mechanisms of corporate corruption and the role of organizational culture [cite: 5, 6, 7].\n\nThis paper aims to provide a comprehensive synthesis of the IB corruption literature. We adopt a multi-disciplinary approach to: (1) clarify key concepts and theoretical frameworks; (2) trace the historical trajectory of regulatory milestones; (3) evaluate methodological challenges; and (4) chart a course for future research, particularly regarding the disruptive effects of technology and the integration of corruption into the ESG agenda [cite: 8, 9]."

This perspective relies heavily on Principal-Agent theory [cite: 11].\n2.  **Institutional Theory:** Suggests that corruption is shaped by the \"rules of the game.\" In countries with weak formal institutions, corruption becomes an institutionalized practice necessary for survival [cite: 4, 11].\n3.  **Cultural Norms:** Posits that corruption is socially embedded. In high-context cultures or those with high power distance, practices labeled as \"corruption\" by Western standards may be viewed as relationship-building (guanxi, wasta) [cite: 1].\n4.  **Moral Failure:** Focuses on the ethical decision-making of individuals and the \"normalization of deviance\" within organizational cultures [cite: 1, 2]."

Economists argued that in developing nations with rigid bureaucracies, bribery could \"grease the wheels\" of commerce, acting as a market mechanism to bypass red tape [cite: 12, 13].

Empirical evidence overwhelmingly suggests that corruption hinders long-term economic development and firm growth [cite: 20, 21].

As MNEs navigate an increasingly digital and transparent world, scholars must investigate how tools like blockchain and AI can be leveraged for integrity, while simultaneously understanding the new risks they introduce. Furthermore, integrating anti-corruption efforts into the broader ESG agenda offers a promising pathway to institutionalize integrity as a core component of sustainable business strategy."
