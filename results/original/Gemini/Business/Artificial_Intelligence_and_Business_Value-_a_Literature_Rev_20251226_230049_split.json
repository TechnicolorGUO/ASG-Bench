However, the translation of AI investments into tangible business value remains a complex and often elusive endeavor, characterized by a \"productivity paradox\" where aggregate statistics fail to reflect firm-level technological advancements. This systematic literature review synthesizes extant research on the relationship between AI and business value. Grounded in the Resource-Based View (RBV) and Dynamic Capabilities frameworks, this paper analyzes the mechanisms through which AI generates value, ranging from operational efficiency to strategic business model innovation. We examine historical milestones, state-of-the-art methods, and prominent case studies, including Netflix and Amazon, to illustrate practical applications. Furthermore, we critically evaluate the challenges of AI adoption, including data governance, ethical considerations, and the measurement of intangible benefits. The review concludes by identifying critical research gaps, particularly regarding Generative AI, and outlines a future research agenda to guide scholars and practitioners in navigating the evolving AI economy.\n\n---"

      "content": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into organizational processes represents one of the most significant technological shifts of the 21st century. As organizations face a deluge of data and a concurrent increase in computational capacity, AI has emerged as a critical lever for competitive advantage [cite: 1, 2]. However, despite the hype and substantial capital investment, many organizations struggle to articulate and realize the business value of AI. This phenomenon, often described as a modern \"productivity paradox,\" suggests a disconnect between the potential of the technology and the realized economic outcomes [cite: 3, 4].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the fragmented nature of the current literature. While computer science literature focuses on algorithmic accuracy, management literature often grapples with organizational implementation without fully opening the \"black box\" of technical capabilities. There is a pressing need for a holistic understanding of how AI technologies create business value, what types of value can be expected, and the organizational contingencies required to capture it [cite: 1, 5, 6].\n\nThis paper aims to provide a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) that elucidates the value-generating mechanisms of AI. We adopt a multi-disciplinary perspective, integrating insights from Information Systems (IS), Strategic Management, and Computer Science. The review is structured to cover key concepts, historical developments, theoretical frameworks (specifically the Resource-Based View and Dynamic Capabilities), empirical case studies, and the emerging challenges posed by Generative AI."

Value is currently concentrated in \"superstar\" firms.\n4.  **Shift to GenAI:** The emergence of Generative AI represents a discontinuity, shifting value creation towards creative and knowledge-based tasks, necessitating new governance and implementation strategies.\n\nFor practitioners, the implication is clear: investing in algorithms without investing in data infrastructure, talent, and organizational change is unlikely to yield returns. For academics, the evolving nature of AI—from predictive to generative—offers a fertile ground for redefining how technology intersects with economic value in the digital age."
