# Configurational Complexity in Cross-Border Phenomena: A Systematic Review of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in International Business Research

**Key Points**
*   **Methodological Fit:** International Business (IB) phenomena are inherently complex, involving multiple interacting contexts (institutional, cultural, economic). Traditional variance-based methods (regression) often assume linearity and symmetry, creating a mismatch with the causal complexity of IB reality.
*   **Core Contributions:** Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) contributes to IB by modeling **equifinality** (multiple pathways to the same outcome), **conjunctural causation** (factors working in combination), and **causal asymmetry** (the causes of success are not simply the inverse of the causes of failure).
*   **Evolution:** While adoption was initially slow compared to sociology or general management, QCA has gained traction in IB since 2008 (Pajunen’s work) and was significantly legitimized by the 2020 *Journal of International Business Studies* editorial by Fainshmidt et al.
*   **Current Trends:** The field is moving toward **Panel-QCA** to handle longitudinal data and integrating **Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA)** to distinguish between "must-have" factors and "sufficient" configurations.

## 1. Introduction

International Business (IB) scholarship is dedicated to understanding the cross-border activities of firms, the interactions between multinational enterprises (MNEs) and their environments, and the comparative analysis of business systems. These phenomena are characterized by high levels of causal complexity, where outcomes are rarely determined by a single variable in isolation. Instead, IB outcomes—such as foreign market entry mode, subsidiary performance, or cross-cultural adjustment—result from the interplay of firm-level capabilities, industry dynamics, and country-level institutional fabrics [cite: 1, 2].

Despite this inherent complexity, the methodological toolkit of IB research has historically been dominated by variance-based approaches, particularly regression analysis. While powerful, these methods typically rely on assumptions of linearity, unifinality (one optimal path), and symmetry (the inverse of a cause leads to the inverse of the outcome) [cite: 3, 4]. Scholars have increasingly argued that this reliance creates a "mismatch" between the complex ontological reality of international business and the reductionist epistemological tools used to study it [cite: 2, 5].

Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), developed originally by Charles Ragin, offers a set-theoretic alternative that bridges qualitative case knowledge with quantitative rigor. By viewing cases as configurations of attributes rather than bundles of separable variables, QCA allows researchers to model causal complexity explicitly [cite: 6, 7].

This systematic literature review examines the contributions of QCA to IB research. It traces the method's historical trajectory, defines its core conceptual advantages for IB scholars, reviews state-of-the-art applications across key IB domains (strategy, culture, innovation), and identifies future research frontiers. The review posits that QCA is not merely an alternative statistical technique but a distinct approach that brings empirical analysis "closer to reality" by embracing the configurational nature of global business [cite: 5, 8].

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

To understand the contribution of QCA to IB, one must first distinguish its underlying logic from standard statistical templates. QCA is grounded in set theory and Boolean algebra, focusing on how conditions combine to produce an outcome [cite: 6, 7].

### 2.1 Configurational Thinking vs. Net Effects
Conventional regression analysis estimates the "net effect" of an independent variable on a dependent variable, holding other factors constant. In contrast, QCA assumes **conjunctural causation**, where the impact of a single condition depends on the presence or absence of other conditions [cite: 5, 7]. For example, in IB, high technological capability might lead to high subsidiary performance only when combined with high local autonomy; in the absence of autonomy, the same capability might lead to frustration and low performance.

### 2.2 Equifinality
Equifinality refers to the possibility that multiple, distinct causal pathways (configurations) can lead to the same outcome [cite: 5, 9]. This is highly relevant in IB, where firms from different institutional backgrounds (e.g., Emerging Market MNEs vs. Developed Market MNEs) may achieve similar global competitive advantages through fundamentally different strategic recipes [cite: 10, 11].

### 2.3 Causal Asymmetry
In correlation-based methods, if a variable correlates positively with an outcome, low levels of that variable are assumed to predict low levels of the outcome. QCA recognizes **causal asymmetry**: the causal recipe for the presence of an outcome (e.g., high export performance) is often different from the recipe for its absence (e.g., low export performance) [cite: 9, 12]. The conditions leading to failure are not necessarily the negation of those leading to success.

### 2.4 Necessity and Sufficiency
QCA distinguishes between necessary and sufficient conditions. A **necessary condition** is a factor that must be present for the outcome to occur (but might not produce it alone). A **sufficient condition** (or configuration) is one that, if present, guarantees the outcome [cite: 13, 14]. This distinction is crucial for IB policy and strategy; for instance, political stability might be necessary for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), but it is not sufficient to attract it without other economic incentives [cite: 15].

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

The integration of QCA into IB research has been a gradual process, lagging slightly behind sociology and general organization studies.

### 3.1 Origins and Early Adoption
Charles Ragin introduced QCA in 1987 as a "synthetic strategy" to bridge the divide between case-oriented qualitative research and variable-oriented quantitative research [cite: 6, 7]. While management scholars began adopting it in the mid-2000s (e.g., Fiss, 2007), IB researchers were initially slower to embrace the method [cite: 3, 11].

### 3.2 The "First Wave" in IB: Pajunen (2008)
A seminal milestone in IB-QCA research was Pajunen’s (2008) study on institutions and FDI inflows [cite: 15, 16]. Pajunen utilized fuzzy-set QCA (fsQCA) to demonstrate that no single institutional factor determines a country's attractiveness to investors. Instead, he identified multiple combinations of institutional factors (e.g., political rights, property rights, corruption levels) that combined to attract FDI. This paper demonstrated the power of QCA to resolve conflicting findings in previous regression-based literature regarding the role of corruption and political risk [cite: 15].

### 3.3 Legitimization and the "Second Wave" (2020–Present)
The field reached a turning point with the publication of the editorial "The contributions of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to international business research" by Fainshmidt, Witt, Aguilera, and Verbeke in the *Journal of International Business Studies* (2020) [cite: 1, 2, 3]. This publication explicitly legitimized the method for the IB community, arguing that IB phenomena are "inherently configurational" and calling for a move beyond reductionist linear models. Following this, there has been a proliferation of QCA studies in top-tier IB journals, expanding from country-level analyses to firm- and subsidiary-level studies [cite: 13, 17].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

As the field has matured, the methodological sophistication of QCA applications in IB has increased.

### 4.1 Fuzzy-Set QCA (fsQCA)
While early versions used "crisp sets" (binary 0 or 1 membership), the dominant form in current IB research is **fuzzy-set QCA (fsQCA)** [cite: 1, 7]. fsQCA allows for partial membership in sets (e.g., a firm can be "mostly" internationalized, calibrated as 0.8), which captures the continuous nature of many IB variables like cultural distance or R&D intensity [cite: 7, 18].

### 4.2 Panel QCA (Dynamic QCA)
A significant limitation of traditional QCA was its static nature, often analyzing cross-sectional data. To address the dynamic nature of international business (e.g., how institutional changes over time affect innovation), scholars have recently adopted **Panel QCA** [cite: 19, 20]. This technique integrates temporal dimensions, allowing researchers to assess consistency and coverage across time and within cases. Recent studies on green finance and digital innovation ecosystems in China have pioneered the use of Panel QCA to track spatiotemporal evolution [cite: 21].

### 4.3 Integration with Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA)
Richter and Hauff (2022) have championed the integration of QCA with **Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA)** [cite: 14, 22]. While QCA is excellent for identifying sufficient configurations, NCA is a standalone method specifically designed to identify "bottlenecks"—conditions that are absolutely required for an outcome. The combination of fsQCA and NCA provides a more complete causal picture, distinguishing between what a firm *must* have (necessity) and the various ways it *can* combine assets to succeed (sufficiency) [cite: 23, 24].

## 5. Applications and Case Studies

The application of QCA in IB has diversified from macro-level country studies to micro-level behavioral analyses.

### 5.1 MNE Strategy and Subsidiary Performance
QCA has proven highly effective in dissecting the "black box" of subsidiary performance. Roh et al. (2024) used fsQCA to analyze 172 Korean MNE subsidiaries in China, identifying distinct configurations of subsidiary capabilities (networking, marketing, technological) that lead to high performance [cite: 17]. Their findings demonstrated that capabilities which might seem insignificant in isolation become powerful when combined in specific recipes, illustrating the principle of conjunctural causation. Similarly, research on Emerging Market Multinationals (EMNEs) has used QCA to identify strategic configurations that allow these firms to compete globally despite lacking traditional ownership advantages [cite: 10].

### 5.2 Location Choice and Entry Modes
The decision of where and how to enter foreign markets is a classic IB problem well-suited for QCA. Building on Pajunen’s work, recent studies have examined the configurations of host country resources that attract different types of MNEs. For instance, a study on biopharmaceutical firms in the U.S. found 15 different resource configurations attracting Developed Market MNEs and 14 for Emerging Market MNEs, highlighting immense equifinality in location choice [cite: 11]. Other research has applied fsQCA to entry mode choices (e.g., Joint Venture vs. Wholly Owned Subsidiary), finding that marketing and technical intensity combine in complex ways to dictate the optimal mode [cite: 25].

### 5.3 Cross-Cultural Management and Expatriation
Cultural distance is a central construct in IB, often treated as a friction or cost. QCA allows for a more nuanced view of how culture interacts with other factors. Recent research has used fsQCA to explore expatriate adjustment, finding that the impact of Cultural Intelligence (CQ) is not linear but depends on configurations of cultural distance and perceived cultural novelty [cite: 18]. These studies show that high cultural distance does not automatically lead to low adjustment if specific configurations of CQ dimensions are present, challenging the assumption of a universal negative effect of distance [cite: 26].

### 5.4 Innovation and Sustainability in Emerging Markets
A rapidly growing area for QCA application is the intersection of digitalization, sustainability, and IB, particularly in the context of China. Studies using Panel QCA have investigated how "Digital Innovation Ecosystems" drive green technological innovation [cite: 20]. These studies reveal that no single factor (e.g., government support or digital infrastructure) is sufficient; rather, high-quality green development requires the synergistic coupling of resource endowments, strategic planning, and innovation capabilities [cite: 19, 27].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

Despite its contributions, QCA faces specific challenges in the IB context.

### 6.1 Calibration and Subjectivity
The validity of fsQCA depends heavily on the calibration of raw data into fuzzy sets (0 to 1). This process requires substantial substantive knowledge and theoretical justification. In IB, calibrating concepts like "high political instability" or "strong cultural distance" can be subjective, leading to potential inconsistencies across studies if not rigorously transparent [cite: 13, 28].

### 6.2 The "Black Box" of Configurations
While QCA identifies *that* certain conditions combine to produce an outcome, it does not always explain *how* or *why* these mechanisms work internally. Critics argue that without in-depth qualitative process tracing, the causal mechanisms within the identified configurations remain opaque [cite: 29, 30].

### 6.3 Sample Size and Generalizability
Although QCA is designed for small-to-medium-N samples (too large for case studies, too small for regression), IB researchers often attempt to apply it to very large datasets. While possible, this can sometimes lead to overly complex solutions that are difficult to interpret theoretically. Conversely, very small samples in cross-cultural research raise questions about the external validity of the configurations identified [cite: 13, 31].

## 7. Future Research Directions

To further advance the contribution of QCA to IB research, several directions are promising:

*   **Multi-Level QCA:** IB is inherently multi-level (country, industry, firm, individual). Future research should aim to apply QCA in multi-level designs, potentially analyzing how country-level configurations (e.g., institutional voids) interact with firm-level configurations (e.g., dynamic capabilities) to produce outcomes [cite: 28, 32].
*   **Temporal and Longitudinal Designs:** The wider adoption of Panel QCA and dynamic QCA is essential. IB scholars should use these methods to study the *evolution* of MNE strategies and the *process* of internationalization over time, rather than just static snapshots [cite: 19, 21].
*   **Mixed Methods (QCA + Qualitative/Quantitative):** Combining QCA with regression (to test net effects vs. configurations) or with deep qualitative case studies (to explain the mechanisms inside the configurations) offers a robust path forward. This "triangulation" can enhance both the internal and external validity of IB theories [cite: 29, 33].
*   **Focus on Necessity:** Following Richter and Hauff (2022), IB scholars should explicitly test for necessary conditions using NCA before conducting sufficiency analyses. This is particularly relevant for policy-oriented IB research, where identifying "bottlenecks" (e.g., minimum infrastructure requirements for FDI) is as important as identifying success recipes [cite: 14, 22].

## 8. Conclusion

Qualitative Comparative Analysis has matured from a niche methodology to a vital instrument in the International Business researcher's toolkit. By aligning the analytical method with the theoretical reality of the field—one defined by complexity, context-dependence, and multiple pathways to success—QCA allows IB scholars to generate insights that are often invisible to traditional variance-based approaches.

The literature demonstrates that QCA is particularly powerful in explaining MNE strategy, location choices, and cross-cultural interactions where equifinality and asymmetry are prevalent. As the field moves toward more dynamic applications via Panel QCA and integrates necessity logic through NCA, configurational analysis stands poised to resolve some of the most persistent ambiguities in international business theory, bringing research closer to the complex reality of the global economy.
