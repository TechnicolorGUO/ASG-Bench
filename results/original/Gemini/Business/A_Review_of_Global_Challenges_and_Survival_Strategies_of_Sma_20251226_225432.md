# A Review of Global Challenges and Survival Strategies of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs): A Systematic Literature Review

**Abstract**
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) constitute the backbone of the global economy, accounting for the vast majority of businesses and employment worldwide. However, they remain disproportionately vulnerable to exogenous shocks, ranging from financial crises and pandemics to geopolitical instability and technological disruption. This systematic literature review synthesizes research spanning from early 20th-century economic theories to the post-COVID-19 landscape of 2024-2025. It critically analyzes the evolution of SME research, the heterogeneity of definitions, and the shifting paradigm of survival strategies. Key findings indicate a transition from static efficiency models to dynamic capabilities, with a contemporary emphasis on digital transformation—specifically Generative AI—and supply chain reconfiguration strategies such as friend-shoring and near-shoring. This paper identifies significant research gaps regarding the long-term viability of "born-global" SMEs in fragmented markets and offers a roadmap for future inquiry into SME antifragility.

## 1. Introduction

Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are universally recognized as the engines of economic growth, innovation, and social cohesion. In both developed and developing economies, SMEs typically represent over 90% of all business entities and are responsible for a significant share of job creation and GDP contribution [cite: 1, 2, 3]. Despite their critical importance, SMEs are characterized by a "liability of smallness," possessing fewer tangible resources, lower liquidity, and limited political influence compared to large multinational corporations (MNCs) [cite: 4].

The motivation for this review stems from the unprecedented confluence of global challenges facing SMEs in the current decade. The aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising geopolitical tensions, and the rapid acceleration of Industry 4.0 and Generative AI have fundamentally altered the operating environment [cite: 2, 5, 6]. While historical literature focused on financial constraints and local competition, contemporary research must address how SMEs survive in an era of "polycrisis"—where economic, ecological, and security crises intersect.

The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature concerning the challenges and survival strategies of SMEs. It aims to:
1.  Clarify the definitional ambiguity surrounding SMEs.
2.  Trace the historical evolution of SME research milestones.
3.  Analyze state-of-the-art survival strategies, including digital adoption and supply chain resilience.
4.  Identify open problems and future research directions.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

One of the persistent challenges in SME research is the lack of a universal definition. The heterogeneity in classification criteria complicates cross-border comparisons and policy formulation.

### 2.1 The Definitional Dilemma
The classification of an enterprise as "micro," "small," or "medium" varies significantly based on economic context, industry, and population size [cite: 7].
*   **The European Union (EU) Definition:** The EU utilizes a standardized definition to determine eligibility for support programs. An SME is defined as an enterprise with fewer than 250 employees and either an annual turnover not exceeding €50 million or a balance sheet total not exceeding €43 million [cite: 8, 9, 10].
*   **The World Bank Group Definition:** The World Bank employs a more flexible approach, often requiring an entity to meet two of three criteria regarding employees, assets, and sales. However, thresholds vary by country income levels, and research within the Bank sometimes conflates SMEs with microenterprises, leading to inconsistencies in data analysis [cite: 11, 12].
*   **Country-Specific Variations:** In China, definitions are industry-specific; an industrial SME can have up to 1,000 employees, whereas retail SMEs have much lower thresholds [cite: 7]. In the US, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has historically adjusted size standards, often counting firms with up to 500 employees as small [cite: 13].

### 2.2 Survival vs. Resilience vs. Antifragility
The literature distinguishes between these concepts:
*   **Survival:** The ability to avoid insolvency and exit the market during a crisis [cite: 4, 14].
*   **Resilience:** The capacity to absorb shocks and return to a pre-crisis state [cite: 15, 16].
*   **Antifragility:** A more recent concept in SME literature, referring to firms that not only survive but grow stronger and more competitive as a result of volatility and stressors [cite: 17].

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

The academic and policy understanding of SMEs has undergone a radical transformation over the last century, shifting from viewing them as inefficient relics to celebrating them as the primary drivers of innovation.

### 3.1 Pre-1970s: The Era of Managerial Capitalism
Prior to the 1970s, economic orthodoxy favored large corporations. Influenced by the efficiency of mass production and economies of scale, small businesses were often viewed as peripheral. The prevailing sentiment, echoed by Calvin Coolidge’s adage "the business of America is business," implicitly prioritized large industrial giants [cite: 13, 18]. Research during this period was sparse, often treating small firms as "mice" that started small and stayed small [cite: 19].

### 3.2 The 1980s: The "Birch" Moment and the Discovery of Gazelles
A paradigm shift occurred with the work of David Birch in 1979 and 1981. Birch’s analysis of Dun & Bradstreet data revealed that small firms with fewer than 20 employees created the majority of net new jobs in the US economy [cite: 20, 21, 22]. He coined the term **"Gazelles"** to describe high-growth firms capable of rapid expansion, distinguishing them from "Elephants" (large, stagnant firms) and "Mice" (static small firms) [cite: 19, 20]. This milestone catalyzed a global wave of SME-focused policy and research, establishing the sector's macroeconomic importance.

### 3.3 The 1990s: Industrial Districts and Clusters
In the 1990s, attention shifted to the collective efficiency of SMEs. Research on **Industrial Districts**, particularly in Italy (e.g., the Third Italy), demonstrated how clusters of small firms could compete globally through specialization, subcontracting, and social embeddedness [cite: 23, 24, 25]. This era highlighted that SMEs did not need to grow large individually if they could achieve "passive collective efficiency" through agglomeration [cite: 26].

### 3.4 2000s–Present: Globalization and Digitalization
The 21st century introduced the concept of the "Born Global" firm—SMEs that internationalize from inception [cite: 27]. The focus shifted to how SMEs navigate economic globalization, financial crises (2008), and the digital revolution [cite: 4, 28, 29]. The Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME), for instance, evolved to address Industry 4.0 and additive manufacturing, reflecting the sector's technological upgrading [cite: 28].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

Contemporary literature on SME survival strategies is dominated by responses to the "polycrisis" environment (COVID-19, inflation, war). The state-of-the-art methods can be categorized into three pillars: Digital Transformation, Supply Chain Reconfiguration, and Strategic Agility.

### 4.1 Digital Transformation and Generative AI
Digitalization has moved from a "nice-to-have" to a survival imperative.
*   **Generative AI (GenAI):** The most recent literature (2023-2025) emphasizes GenAI as a leveler for SMEs. Unlike traditional AI, which requires vast proprietary data, GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Midjourney) allow SMEs to automate content creation, customer service, and coding with minimal investment [cite: 2, 30, 31].
*   **Augmentation vs. Automation:** Successful SMEs are adopting an "augmentation" strategy—using AI to enhance human workflows rather than replace them. This approach reduces operational costs while maintaining the personalized service that differentiates SMEs from large competitors [cite: 30].
*   **Industry 4.0:** In manufacturing, the integration of IoT and cloud computing enables SMEs to achieve "smart manufacturing," allowing for predictive maintenance and data-driven decision-making [cite: 32, 33, 34].

### 4.2 Supply Chain Reconfiguration: The "Shoring" Trends
The disruption of global supply chains has forced SMEs to abandon pure cost-minimization models in favor of resilience.
*   **Near-shoring:** Moving production to geographically closer countries to reduce transit times and gain better control over operations. Examples include US firms moving operations to Mexico or EU firms sourcing from Turkey [cite: 35, 36, 37, 38].
*   **Friend-shoring:** A strategy driven by geopolitical risk, where SMEs relocate supply chains to countries with shared political values and stable diplomatic relations. This mitigates risks associated with trade wars and sanctions [cite: 35, 39, 40, 41, 42].
*   **Diversification:** Moving away from single-source dependencies. Research indicates that SMEs are increasingly adopting multi-sourcing strategies to buffer against localized disruptions [cite: 16].

### 4.3 Strategic Agility and Financial Bootstrapping
*   **Pivoting:** The COVID-19 crisis highlighted the importance of strategic pivoting—rapidly changing business models (e.g., restaurants becoming grocery suppliers). This requires "dynamic capabilities" to sense and seize new opportunities [cite: 6, 20, 43].
*   **Financial Resilience:** Effective working capital management and "bootstrapping" (minimizing external debt) are cited as critical survival techniques during liquidity crunches [cite: 5, 44].

---

## 5. Applications and Case Studies

Empirical evidence from diverse geographies illustrates the practical application of these strategies.

### 5.1 Developed Economies: Germany and Italy
*   **Germany (The Mittelstand):** German manufacturing SMEs are pioneering digital transformation. Case studies reveal that while explicit digital strategies are often absent, SMEs successfully implement bottom-up digital process transformations. For example, BOGE Kompressoren utilized data analytics to shift from selling products to selling "compressed air as a service," enhancing efficiency and customer retention [cite: 33, 45, 46].
*   **Italy (Tourism and Food):** During the COVID-19 pandemic, Italian SMEs in the food and tourism sectors demonstrated remarkable resilience. Case studies from the Campania region and Venice show that firms which diversified their portfolios (e.g., hotels offering local food delivery) and adopted digital marketing channels survived the collapse of international tourism [cite: 6, 47, 48, 49].

### 5.2 Emerging Economies: Nigeria, India, and Sri Lanka
*   **Institutional Voids:** SMEs in developing nations face distinct challenges, including unreliable infrastructure (electricity), corruption, and limited access to formal finance [cite: 50, 51, 52].
*   **Resilience Mechanisms:** In Nigeria and India, survival often depends on "bricolage"—making do with available resources—and strong social networks. Research indicates that SMEs in these regions are increasingly leveraging mobile technology and fintech to bypass traditional banking hurdles [cite: 44, 53].
*   **Sri Lanka:** Studies on the agricultural sector reveal that survival during economic crises is heavily dependent on government policy interventions and the ability of SMEs to navigate import restrictions [cite: 54].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

Despite the availability of survival strategies, significant barriers remain.

### 6.1 The "Cliff-Edge" of Growth
Regulatory frameworks often penalize growth. In the EU, crossing the threshold from "small" to "medium" or "medium" to "large" can result in the loss of subsidies and increased compliance costs, creating a "cliff-edge" effect that discourages expansion [cite: 8].

### 6.2 The Digital Divide and Skills Gap
While GenAI offers opportunities, there is a profound skills gap. SMEs often lack the internal expertise to implement complex digital solutions or ensure cybersecurity. The "dark side" of digitalization includes increased vulnerability to cyberattacks (ransomware), which disproportionately affect resource-poor SMEs [cite: 55, 56].

### 6.3 Geopolitical Fragmentation
The trend toward friend-shoring and near-shoring, while resilient, threatens to fragment the global market. This poses a specific challenge for "Born Global" SMEs that rely on open, multilateral trade systems. Navigating a world of sanctions and trade barriers requires legal and compliance resources that most SMEs lack [cite: 4, 39, 42].

---

## 7. Future Research Directions

The review identifies several critical gaps that warrant further academic inquiry:

1.  **Longitudinal Studies on "Friend-shoring":** As friend-shoring is a nascent phenomenon (post-2022), there is little empirical data on its long-term cost implications for SMEs. Future research should quantify the trade-off between resilience and efficiency [cite: 39, 41].
2.  **SME Antifragility:** Moving beyond resilience, research should explore how SMEs can structure themselves to benefit from volatility. This involves studying the intersection of organizational structure and rapid decision-making in turbulent markets [cite: 17].
3.  **AI Ethics and Implementation in SMEs:** Most AI research focuses on large firms. There is a need for frameworks specifically designed for SMEs to adopt AI ethically and securely, addressing the specific risks of bias and data privacy in smaller datasets [cite: 2, 57].
4.  **Psychological Resilience of Entrepreneurs:** The survival of an SME is often inextricably linked to the mental health and resilience of the owner-manager. This "micro-foundation" of survival remains under-researched in the context of global crises [cite: 20, 58].

---

## 8. Conclusion

The landscape for Small and Medium Enterprises has shifted from a focus on local efficiency to global resilience. This systematic review highlights that while the challenges facing SMEs—ranging from definition inconsistencies to global polycrises—are formidable, the strategies for survival have become increasingly sophisticated. The historical view of SMEs as "mice" has been replaced by a recognition of their potential as "gazelles" and resilient innovators.

Current state-of-the-art survival depends on a dual capability: the **technological agility** to adopt tools like Generative AI for cost efficiency, and the **strategic foresight** to reconfigure supply chains through near-shoring and friend-shoring. However, the digital divide and geopolitical fragmentation remain existential threats. Future scholarship must move beyond static survival models to dynamic frameworks of antifragility, ensuring that SMEs continue to serve as the vital heartbeat of the global economy.
