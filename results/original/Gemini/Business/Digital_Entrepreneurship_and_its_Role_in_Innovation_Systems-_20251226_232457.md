# Digital Entrepreneurship and its Role in Innovation Systems: A Systematic Literature Review as a Basis for Future Research Avenues for Sustainable Transitions

**Abstract**
The intersection of digital entrepreneurship (DE), innovation systems (IS), and sustainable transitions represents a critical frontier in contemporary management and economic research. As digital technologies reshape industrial structures and societal interactions, they simultaneously offer mechanisms for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and introduce new systemic vulnerabilities. This comprehensive systematic literature review synthesizes existing research to elucidate the hybrid concept of digital entrepreneurship and its catalytic role within innovation systems. Building upon foundational work by Satalkina and Steiner (2020) and integrating recent developments regarding the "Twin Transition" (digital and green), this paper identifies key determinants across three dimensions: the entrepreneur, the entrepreneurial process, and the ecosystem. The review highlights the dual nature of digitalization as both an enabler of circular economy models and a source of environmental and social risk. We conclude by outlining a robust agenda for future research, emphasizing the need for transdisciplinary approaches to navigate the complexities of socio-technical transformations.

## 1. Introduction and Background

In the twenty-first century, the global economy is undergoing a profound metamorphosis driven by two concurrent forces: the rapid proliferation of digital technologies and the urgent imperative for environmental sustainability. This convergence, often termed the "Twin Transition," has positioned digital entrepreneurship not merely as a commercial activity but as a systemic driver of change within broader innovation systems [cite: 1, 2].

Digital entrepreneurship is increasingly recognized as an essential driver within the innovation system, fundamentally altering the structure, aims, and networking mechanisms of the overall business environment [cite: 3, 4]. Unlike traditional entrepreneurship, which may view technology as a support function, digital entrepreneurship places digital artifacts and platforms at the core of value creation. This shift affects various levels and dimensions of the innovation system, from individual competence profiles to regional infrastructure [cite: 5].

However, the integration of digital technologies into entrepreneurial ventures is not without paradoxes. While digitalization provides novel business opportunities—such as dematerialization, efficiency gains, and global market access—it is also disruptive, causing new vulnerabilities including cyber threats, the digital divide, and unforeseen environmental costs (e.g., energy consumption of data centers) [cite: 3, 6]. Consequently, understanding the role of digital entrepreneurship requires a holistic view that transcends the firm level and considers the "metasystem" of innovation [cite: 7].

The motivation for this review stems from the fragmentation of current literature. While substantial research exists on digital entrepreneurship and sustainable development separately, their intersection within the context of innovation systems remains under-theorized [cite: 8, 9]. This paper aims to bridge this gap by systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art literature, categorizing key themes, and identifying research avenues that support sustainable socio-technical transitions.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

To establish a rigorous theoretical baseline, it is necessary to define the core constructs and their interrelationships as presented in the academic discourse.

### 2.1 Digital Entrepreneurship (DE)
Digital entrepreneurship is defined as the creation of new ventures or the transformation of existing businesses through the development of novel digital technologies or the innovative application of such technologies [cite: 10, 11]. It is a hybrid concept where digital technologies are not just enablers but are intrinsic to the entrepreneurial outcome.
*   **Scope:** It encompasses the sale of digital products/services, the use of digital platforms for operations, and the digitization of value chains [cite: 12].
*   **Differentiation:** Unlike traditional entrepreneurship, DE relies heavily on digital affordances, spatial flexibility, and platform-based ecosystems [cite: 3].
*   **Categories:** The literature distinguishes between "pure" digital entrepreneurs (creating digital goods) and those who digitize traditional processes to enhance efficiency or reach [cite: 13].

### 2.2 Innovation Systems (IS)
The innovation system is conceptualized as a "metasystem" that encompasses the network of institutions, rules, and actors that influence the speed and direction of technological change [cite: 7, 14].
*   **Role of DE:** Within this system, digital entrepreneurship acts as a dynamic mechanism that changes networking patterns and competitive structures. It serves as a vehicle for knowledge spillover and technological diffusion [cite: 7, 15].
*   **Dimensions:** Satalkina and Steiner (2020) identify three core dimensions of IS affected by DE:
    1.  **The Entrepreneur:** Behavioral patterns, competencies, and mentality.
    2.  **The Entrepreneurial Process:** Digitalization of management, strategy, and startup establishment.
    3.  **The Ecosystem:** External infrastructure, institutions, and policy frameworks [cite: 3, 16].

### 2.3 Sustainable Transitions and the Twin Transition
Sustainable transitions refer to the shift of socio-technical systems toward more sustainable modes of production and consumption.
*   **Twin Transition:** This emerging concept refers to the simultaneous pursuit of digitalization and decarbonization. It posits that digital technologies (AI, IoT, Blockchain) are critical enablers for circular economy models and resource efficiency [cite: 1, 2, 17].
*   **Digital Sustainability:** This involves organizational actions that promote Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the innovative use of electronic data and digital tools [cite: 18, 19].

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

The academic understanding of digital entrepreneurship has evolved through distinct phases, moving from a focus on e-commerce to complex ecosystem dynamics.

### 3.1 Phase I: E-Entrepreneurship and the Internet Economy (Late 1990s–2010)
Early literature focused on "e-entrepreneurship" and the "net economy." The primary interest was the establishment of companies using electronic platforms for data networks. Definitions from this era emphasized the "purely electronic creation of value" and the novelty of the internet as a sales channel [cite: 11]. The focus was largely on the firm level and the adoption of ICT (Information and Communication Technology).

### 3.2 Phase II: Digital Entrepreneurship and Platforms (2010–2019)
As mobile computing and social media matured, the focus shifted to "digital entrepreneurship" as a broader phenomenon. Research began to explore how digital affordances (spatial and temporal) altered the entrepreneurial process itself [cite: 3]. Key milestones included the recognition of digital platforms not just as tools, but as regulatory structures that define market interactions. This period saw the emergence of the "Digital Entrepreneurial Ecosystem" (DEE) concept, distinguishing it from traditional regional innovation systems by emphasizing digital connectivity over geographic proximity [cite: 20, 21].

### 3.3 Phase III: Systemic Integration and Sustainable Transitions (2020–Present)
The publication of Satalkina and Steiner’s (2020) systematic review marked a pivotal moment by explicitly linking DE to *Innovation Systems* and *Sustainable Transitions* [cite: 3]. This phase is characterized by:
*   **The Twin Transition:** Post-2020 literature, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, heavily emphasizes the "Twin Transition," exploring how digital resilience supports environmental goals [cite: 1, 22].
*   **Ecosystem Maturity:** Recent studies (2023–2025) have moved toward analyzing the specific configurations of DEEs that drive sustainable development, particularly in developing regions like Latin America and Southern Africa [cite: 23, 24, 25].
*   **Critical Perspectives:** A growing body of work now questions the "utopian" view of digital sustainability, analyzing the "dark side" of digitalization, such as the material footprint of digital hardware [cite: 6].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

Research in this domain has become increasingly methodologically sophisticated, moving from descriptive case studies to rigorous quantitative and mixed-method analyses.

### 4.1 Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) and PRISMA
The Systematic Literature Review (SLR) remains the gold standard for mapping this fragmented field. The **PRISMA** (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement is widely used to ensure transparency and replicability [cite: 3, 26, 27].
*   **Application:** Satalkina and Steiner (2020) utilized PRISMA to filter 52 core papers, allowing for the categorization of DE determinants within innovation systems [cite: 3, 16].
*   **Bibliometrics:** Researchers employ bibliometric analysis (using tools like VOSviewer) to identify thematic clusters, such as "innovation and entrepreneurship," "digital transformation strategies," and "SDGs" [cite: 8, 28].

### 4.2 Fuzzy-Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA)
To understand the complex causal configurations of ecosystems, scholars are increasingly using **fsQCA**.
*   **Utility:** This method allows researchers to identify multiple pathways (combinations of conditions) that lead to a specific outcome, such as high levels of female entrepreneurial activity or sustainable development [cite: 24, 29].
*   **Findings:** For instance, studies in Latin America used fsQCA to determine that "Digital Protection" and "Networking" are necessary conditions for DEEs to effectively drive social and environmental sustainability [cite: 24, 25].

### 4.3 Case Study and Qualitative Approaches
Qualitative methods remain vital for exploring emerging phenomena where theory is nascent.
*   **Grounded Theory:** Used to identify characteristics of "sustainable digital entrepreneurs" and develop maturity models for IT-for-Sustainability [cite: 9].
*   **Multi-Case Analysis:** Recent studies have employed multiple case studies (e.g., 16 circular businesses) to empirically validate how digital technologies (AI, Blockchain) facilitate the transition from linear to circular business models [cite: 30].

---

## 5. Applications and Case Studies

The theoretical frameworks of digital entrepreneurship are being applied across various sectors to drive sustainable transitions.

### 5.1 The Circular Economy and Circular Startups (CSUs)
Digital technologies are the backbone of the "Smart Circular Economy."
*   **Mechanisms:** Digital platforms facilitate the sharing economy, product-as-a-service models, and reverse logistics. Technologies like IoT and Blockchain provide the traceability required to close material loops [cite: 19, 30].
*   **Case Evidence:** Startups are using digital twins to optimize lifecycle management and reduce waste. Research indicates that digital platforms reduce entry barriers for green ventures by providing access to global markets and alternative funding (crowdfunding) [cite: 26].
*   **Ecosystem Role:** A systems theory perspective reveals that specific DEE elements, such as digital access and protection, are critical drivers for the formation of Circular Startups (CSUs) [cite: 31, 32].

### 5.2 Regional Transitions: Latin America and the Global South
The application of DE in developing economies highlights its role in "leapfrogging" traditional developmental constraints.
*   **Latin America:** Research utilizing the Global Entrepreneurship Development Institute (GEDI) framework shows that even countries with partial digitalization can leverage DEEs for significant sustainable development gains if they focus on networking and technology transfer [cite: 24].
*   **Southern Africa:** In resource-constrained environments like Zimbabwe, digital innovation (e.g., mobile money) acts as a compensatory mechanism for institutional weaknesses, enabling a "Digital-Green Convergence" [cite: 23].
*   **Rural Entrepreneurship:** In Indonesia, digital platforms have been shown to empower women and rural entrepreneurs, although challenges regarding digital literacy and infrastructure persist [cite: 27, 33].

### 5.3 Industry 4.0 and 5.0
The manufacturing sector is witnessing a "Twin Transition" where Industry 4.0 technologies (automation, data exchange) are aligned with sustainability goals (Industry 5.0).
*   **SMEs:** For Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), financial literacy and digital literacy are identified as causal drivers for engaging in both digital and sustainable activities [cite: 34].
*   **Steel and Chemicals:** In heavy processing industries, digital innovation systems (e.g., AI for process optimization) are being used to decarbonize operations, though there is a risk that these technologies may reinforce fossil-based incumbents rather than disrupting them [cite: 17, 35].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

Despite the optimistic narratives surrounding the Twin Transition, the literature identifies significant challenges and systemic vulnerabilities.

### 6.1 The "Dark Side" of Digitalization
A critical open problem is the environmental footprint of the digital infrastructure itself.
*   **Energy and Waste:** The production of digital hardware, the energy consumption of data centers, and the generation of e-waste constitute a "rebound effect" where digital efficiency gains are offset by increased consumption [cite: 1, 6].
*   **Decoupling Myth:** Some scholars argue that promoting digital entrepreneurial ecosystems does not guarantee a decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation; in fact, countries with higher digital entrepreneurship scores often have higher material footprints [cite: 6].

### 6.2 Systemic Vulnerabilities and Inequality
Digital entrepreneurship changes the structure of innovation systems, introducing new risks.
*   **Vulnerabilities:** The reliance on digital platforms creates dependencies that can be exploited (cyber threats) or disrupted. Furthermore, the "winner-takes-all" nature of platform economies can exacerbate income inequality [cite: 3, 36].
*   **Digital Divide:** In developing contexts, the lack of institutional readiness and infrastructure creates a barrier to entry, potentially widening the gap between digital "haves" and "have-nots" [cite: 23, 33].

### 6.3 Theoretical and Methodological Fragmentation
*   **Siloed Research:** Sustainable entrepreneurship and digital entrepreneurship are often treated as separate domains. There is a lack of unified frameworks that explain how entrepreneurs can employ digital technologies specifically for sustainability beyond anecdotal evidence [cite: 9, 26].
*   **Measurement Gaps:** There is a scarcity of metrics that simultaneously capture the economic, social, and environmental impacts of digital ventures within an ecosystem [cite: 21].

---

## 7. Future Research Directions

Based on the gaps identified in the systematic review, several avenues for future research are proposed to advance the field of sustainable digital transitions.

### 7.1 The Nexus of Twin Transitions
Future research must move beyond the general "compatibility" of digital and green goals to investigate the *mechanisms* of their integration.
*   **Research Question:** How do specific digital technologies (e.g., AI vs. Blockchain) differentially impact environmental outcomes in varying industrial contexts? [cite: 2, 37].
*   **Policy Frameworks:** There is a need for research into "Digital-Green Convergence Frameworks" that guide policymakers in designing incentives that align digital adoption with decarbonization targets [cite: 23].

### 7.2 Ecosystem Resilience and Institutional Innovation
*   **Resilience:** How do Digital Entrepreneurial Ecosystems (DEEs) adapt to external shocks (pandemics, climate crises)? Longitudinal studies are needed to understand the dynamic evolution of these ecosystems [cite: 7, 21].
*   **Institutional Voids:** Research should explore how digital entrepreneurship can foster institutional innovation in the Global South, creating new governance models for sustainability where traditional institutions fail [cite: 23].

### 7.3 Transdisciplinary and Systems Science Approaches
To address the complexity of innovation systems, future studies should adopt transdisciplinary methods.
*   **Methodology:** Expanding the application of systems science to model the interdependencies between the entrepreneur, the process, and the ecosystem. This includes analyzing potential "tipping points" where digital adoption might lead to irreversible environmental harm or breakthrough sustainability [cite: 7].
*   **Human-Centricity:** Investigating the behavioral and competence patterns of the "sustainable digital entrepreneur." How does the "entrepreneurial awareness" of sustainability evolve in a digital-first environment? [cite: 9, 15].

### 7.4 Addressing the "Dark Side"
Rigorous empirical research is required to quantify the net environmental impact of digital entrepreneurship.
*   **Lifecycle Analysis:** Studies should conduct full lifecycle analyses of digital ventures to assess whether their dematerialization benefits outweigh their hardware and energy costs [cite: 6].

## 8. Conclusion

This systematic literature review confirms that digital entrepreneurship is a hybrid and transformative force within innovation systems, serving as a critical lever for sustainable transitions. The analysis of 52 core papers and subsequent recent literature reveals that digital entrepreneurship operates across three fundamental dimensions: the **entrepreneur** (competencies and intent), the **entrepreneurial process** (digitalization of value creation), and the **ecosystem** (infrastructure and policy) [cite: 3, 5].

The integration of digital technologies into entrepreneurship offers unprecedented opportunities for circular economy models, resource efficiency, and global market inclusion. However, this transition is not automatically sustainable. It is fraught with challenges, including the environmental cost of digital infrastructure and the risk of exacerbating social inequalities.

For the "Twin Transition" to be successful, future research and policy must move beyond techno-optimism. A rigorous, systems-based approach is required—one that acknowledges the trade-offs and actively steers digital innovation toward regenerative and inclusive outcomes. By understanding the interrelations between digital entrepreneurship and the broader socioeconomic system, scholars and practitioners can better navigate the complexities of the 21st-century economic landscape.
