      "level": 2,
      "content": "International Business (IB) scholarship is dedicated to understanding the cross-border activities of firms, the interactions between multinational enterprises (MNEs) and their environments, and the comparative analysis of business systems. These phenomena are characterized by high levels of causal complexity, where outcomes are rarely determined by a single variable in isolation. Instead, IB outcomes—such as foreign market entry mode, subsidiary performance, or cross-cultural adjustment—result from the interplay of firm-level capabilities, industry dynamics, and country-level institutional fabrics [cite: 1, 2].\n\nDespite this inherent complexity, the methodological toolkit of IB research has historically been dominated by variance-based approaches, particularly regression analysis. While powerful, these methods typically rely on assumptions of linearity, unifinality (one optimal path), and symmetry (the inverse of a cause leads to the inverse of the outcome) [cite: 3, 4]. Scholars have increasingly argued that this reliance creates a \"mismatch\" between the complex ontological reality of international business and the reductionist epistemological tools used to study it [cite: 2, 5].\n\nQualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), developed originally by Charles Ragin, offers a set-theoretic alternative that bridges qualitative case knowledge with quantitative rigor. By viewing cases as configurations of attributes rather than bundles of separable variables, QCA allows researchers to model causal complexity explicitly [cite: 6, 7].\n\nThis systematic literature review examines the contributions of QCA to IB research. It traces the method's historical trajectory, defines its core conceptual advantages for IB scholars, reviews state-of-the-art applications across key IB domains (strategy, culture, innovation), and identifies future research frontiers. The review posits that QCA is not merely an alternative statistical technique but a distinct approach that brings empirical analysis \"closer to reality\" by embracing the configurational nature of global business [cite: 5, 8]."

In contrast, QCA assumes **conjunctural causation**, where the impact of a single condition depends on the presence or absence of other conditions [cite: 5, 7]. For example, in IB, high technological capability might lead to high subsidiary performance only when combined with high local autonomy; in the absence of autonomy, the same capability might lead to frustration and low performance."

QCA recognizes **causal asymmetry**: the causal recipe for the presence of an outcome (e.g., high export performance) is often different from the recipe for its absence (e.g., low export performance) [cite: 9, 12]. The conditions leading to failure are not necessarily the negation of those leading to success."

      "heading": "2.4 Necessity and Sufficiency",

      "content": "QCA distinguishes between necessary and sufficient conditions. A **necessary condition** is a factor that must be present for the outcome to occur (but might not produce it alone). A **sufficient condition** (or configuration) is one that, if present, guarantees the outcome [cite: 13, 14]. This distinction is crucial for IB policy and strategy; for instance, political stability might be necessary for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), but it is not sufficient to attract it without other economic incentives [cite: 15]."

Instead, he identified multiple combinations of institutional factors (e.g., political rights, property rights, corruption levels) that combined to attract FDI. This paper demonstrated the power of QCA to resolve conflicting findings in previous regression-based literature regarding the role of corruption and political risk [cite: 15]."

This publication explicitly legitimized the method for the IB community, arguing that IB phenomena are \"inherently configurational\" and calling for a move beyond reductionist linear models.

Their findings demonstrated that capabilities which might seem insignificant in isolation become powerful when combined in specific recipes, illustrating the principle of conjunctural causation.

For instance, a study on biopharmaceutical firms in the U.S. found 15 different resource configurations attracting Developed Market MNEs and 14 for Emerging Market MNEs, highlighting immense equifinality in location choice [cite: 11]. Other research has applied fsQCA to entry mode choices (e.g., Joint Venture vs. Wholly Owned Subsidiary), finding that marketing and technical intensity combine in complex ways to dictate the optimal mode [cite: 25]."

Recent research has used fsQCA to explore expatriate adjustment, finding that the impact of Cultural Intelligence (CQ) is not linear but depends on configurations of cultural distance and perceived cultural novelty [cite: 18]. These studies show that high cultural distance does not automatically lead to low adjustment if specific configurations of CQ dimensions are present, challenging the assumption of a universal negative effect of distance [cite: 26]."

Future research should aim to apply QCA in multi-level designs, potentially analyzing how country-level configurations (e.g., institutional voids) interact with firm-level configurations (e.g., dynamic capabilities) to produce outcomes [cite: 28, 32].\n*   **Temporal and Longitudinal Designs:** The wider adoption of Panel QCA and dynamic QCA is essential. IB scholars should use these methods to study the *evolution* of MNE strategies and the *process* of internationalization over time, rather than just static snapshots [cite: 19, 21].\n*   **Mixed Methods (QCA + Qualitative/Quantitative):** Combining QCA with regression (to test net effects vs. configurations) or with deep qualitative case studies (to explain the mechanisms inside the configurations) offers a robust path forward. This \"triangulation\" can enhance both the internal and external validity of IB theories [cite: 29, 33].\n*   **Focus on Necessity:** Following Richter and Hauff (2022), IB scholars should explicitly test for necessary conditions using NCA before conducting sufficiency analyses. This is particularly relevant for policy-oriented IB research, where identifying \"bottlenecks\" (e.g., minimum infrastructure requirements for FDI) is as important as identifying success recipes [cite: 14, 22]."

    {
      "heading": "8. Conclusion",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Qualitative Comparative Analysis has matured from a niche methodology to a vital instrument in the International Business researcher's toolkit. By aligning the analytical method with the theoretical reality of the field—one defined by complexity, context-dependence, and multiple pathways to success—QCA allows IB scholars to generate insights that are often invisible to traditional variance-based approaches.\n\nThe literature demonstrates that QCA is particularly powerful in explaining MNE strategy, location choices, and cross-cultural interactions where equifinality and asymmetry are prevalent. As the field moves toward more dynamic applications via Panel QCA and integrates necessity logic through NCA, configurational analysis stands poised to resolve some of the most persistent ambiguities in international business theory, bringing research closer to the complex reality of the global economy."
