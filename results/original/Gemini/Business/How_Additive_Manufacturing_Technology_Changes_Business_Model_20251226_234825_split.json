      "content": "Additive Manufacturing (AM), colloquially known as 3D printing, has evolved from a rapid prototyping niche into a transformative industrial force capable of reshaping global supply chains and business architectures. This systematic literature review investigates the intersection of AM technology and business model innovation (BMI). By synthesizing data from over 100 academic sources and industry reports, this paper analyzes how AM alters the three pillars of business models: value creation, value delivery, and value capture. The review identifies a shift from centralized, forecast-based production to decentralized, on-demand manufacturing. It highlights the emergence of circular business models that leverage AM for sustainability and waste reduction. Furthermore, the paper provides a critical analysis of recent industry upheavals, contrasting the operational success of industrial adopters like GE Aviation with the financial failures of aggregator platforms like Shapeways. The study concludes that while AM lowers barriers to entry and enables unprecedented design freedom, its successful commercialization requires a holistic restructuring of business logic rather than a mere substitution of manufacturing processes."

Among these, Additive Manufacturing (AM) stands out as a disruptive force capable of decoupling manufacturing complexity from cost [cite: 1, 2]. Unlike traditional subtractive manufacturing, where cost increases with design complexity, AM allows for the production of intricate geometries with no additional tooling costs. This unique characteristic challenges the dominant logic of economies of scale that has defined industrial business models for a century [cite: 3].\n\nHowever, despite the technological maturity of AM, the literature suggests a lag in business model innovation. Companies often attempt to shoehorn AM into existing linear business models, failing to capture its full strategic value [cite: 3, 4]. The motivation for this review stems from the need to understand not just the *technological* capabilities of AM, but the *managerial* and *strategic* implications that dictate firm survival and growth."

To critically evaluate real-world case studies to identify success factors and failure modes in AM-centric business models.\n4.
