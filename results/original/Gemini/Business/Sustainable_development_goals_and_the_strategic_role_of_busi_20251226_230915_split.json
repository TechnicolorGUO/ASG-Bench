This systematic literature review examines the evolving relationship between business strategy and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It synthesizes findings from over 100 academic sources, analyzing how firms integrate SDGs into their business models, the technological enablers facilitating this transition, and the persistent challenges of \"SDG-washing.\" While multinational enterprises (MNEs) like Unilever and Interface demonstrate advanced strategic alignment, significant gaps remain in Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) engagement and the measurement of substantive impact versus symbolic adoption. This paper provides a comprehensive roadmap of the current state of research, highlighting the tension between the privatization of governance and the necessity of private sector resources in achieving global development targets.\n\n---"

      "content": "The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in 2015, represent a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all by 2030. Unlike their predecessors, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the SDGs explicitly call upon the private sector to play a pivotal role in their achievement [cite: 1, 2]. This shift recognizes that the scale of investment and innovation required to meet the 169 targets exceeds the capacity of governments and NGOs alone [cite: 3]. Consequently, the academic discourse has moved from questioning *whether* business should contribute to sustainable development to investigating *how* these goals can be integrated into the strategic core of business operations [cite: 4, 5].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the increasing pressure on firms to demonstrate legitimacy and long-term viability through SDG alignment. However, despite the proliferation of sustainability reports, evidence suggests that corporate engagement often remains superficial, a phenomenon increasingly termed \"SDG-washing\" [cite: 6, 7]. Furthermore, the literature reveals a dichotomy: while large corporations possess the resources to align with SDGs, they often face scrutiny regarding the depth of their commitment, whereas SMEs face resource constraints despite being crucial for local implementation [cite: 8, 9].\n\nThis paper aims to provide a comprehensive systematic review of the strategic role of business in achieving the SDGs. It covers historical evolution, current methodological frameworks (such as the SDG Compass and Digital Twins), empirical case studies, and critical perspectives on the privatization of global governance."

The literature confirms that the SDGs have successfully elevated sustainability from a compliance issue to a strategic priority for many global firms. Leading companies like Unilever, Patagonia, and Iberdrola demonstrate that aligning with the SDGs can drive innovation, risk resilience, and financial performance.\n\nHowever, the field is beset by the challenge of distinguishing between genuine strategic transformation and symbolic \"SDG-washing.\" The reliance on voluntary reporting and the lack of standardized impact measurement tools allow for significant decoupling of rhetoric and reality. Furthermore, the increasing role of business in delivering public goods raises profound questions about governance and accountability.\n\nFor the 2030 Agenda to be realized, the \"strategic role of business\" must evolve from selective adoption to holistic integration. This requires not only technological innovation and new business models but also a rigorous academic and regulatory environment that holds the private sector accountable for its profound influence on the planet's future."
