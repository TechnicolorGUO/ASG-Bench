# Corruption in International Business: A Systematic Review and Research Agenda

**Key Points**
*   **Ubiquity and Cost:** Corruption remains a pervasive challenge in international business (IB), estimated to cost the global economy trillions annually, distorting markets and undermining institutional trust.
*   **Theoretical Evolution:** The field has moved from viewing corruption as a "grease the wheels" mechanism (efficiency-enhancing in weak bureaucracies) to a "sand the wheels" consensus (detrimental to long-term growth and firm performance).
*   **Regulatory Landscape:** The enforcement environment has shifted dramatically from the pre-1977 era of tax-deductible bribes to a rigorous global regime anchored by the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act, and the OECD Convention.
*   **Methodological Shifts:** Research is transitioning from reliance on aggregate perception indices (e.g., CPI) toward firm-level surveys, experimental designs, and forensic case studies to overcome measurement biases.
*   **Emerging Frontiers:** Future research must address the "dark side" of digitalization (cryptocurrencies facilitating illicit flows) versus the "bright side" (blockchain for transparency), and the integration of anti-corruption into Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) frameworks.

## Abstract

Corruption in international business (IB) represents one of the most complex and enduring challenges for multinational enterprises (MNEs), policymakers, and scholars. This systematic literature review synthesizes three decades of research to map the intellectual terrain of the field. We analyze the evolution of corruption research from early economic rationalizations to contemporary sociological and institutional perspectives. The review categorizes the literature into key streams: legislative frameworks, determinants of corruption, the "grease vs. sand" debate, and the impact on firm internationalization strategies. We critically evaluate state-of-the-art methodologies, highlighting the limitations of perception-based indices and the promise of experimental approaches. Furthermore, we present detailed case studies of landmark scandals—Siemens, Odebrecht, and 1MDB—to illustrate the mechanisms of systemic graft. Finally, we propose a robust future research agenda focused on the intersection of corruption with digitalization, blockchain technology, and the burgeoning ESG movement, identifying critical gaps that demand scholarly attention.

## 1. Introduction

Corruption, defined broadly as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain, is a multifaceted phenomenon that permeates political, economic, and social spheres. In the context of International Business (IB), corruption introduces significant uncertainty, alters entry strategies, and affects the operational performance of Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) [cite: 1, 2]. Despite the proliferation of anti-corruption legislation and compliance programs, corruption remains a persistent "grand challenge," with the World Economic Forum estimating the cost of corruption at over US $2.6 trillion annually, or 5% of global GDP [cite: 2].

The motivation for this review stems from the fragmentation of the existing literature. While scholars from economics, law, political science, and management have examined corruption, these streams often remain siloed [cite: 3, 4]. Early research largely focused on the macroeconomic determinants of corruption or the "grease the wheels" hypothesis. However, recent high-profile scandals involving global conglomerates like Siemens, Airbus, and Glencore have shifted the focus toward the internal mechanisms of corporate corruption and the role of organizational culture [cite: 5, 6, 7].

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive synthesis of the IB corruption literature. We adopt a multi-disciplinary approach to: (1) clarify key concepts and theoretical frameworks; (2) trace the historical trajectory of regulatory milestones; (3) evaluate methodological challenges; and (4) chart a course for future research, particularly regarding the disruptive effects of technology and the integration of corruption into the ESG agenda [cite: 8, 9].

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

### 2.1 Defining Corruption in IB
Corruption in IB is typically categorized into "grand corruption" (involving high-level officials and large sums) and "petty corruption" (facilitation payments to low-level bureaucrats) [cite: 10]. While traditional definitions focus on public abuse of power, the literature increasingly recognizes "private-to-private" corruption, where corporate officers abuse their positions for personal gain at the expense of the firm or shareholders [cite: 1, 4].

### 2.2 Theoretical Perspectives
Recent systematic reviews identify four dominant theoretical perspectives in management research on corruption [cite: 1, 2]:
1.  **Rational Action:** Views corruption as a calculated decision where the expected benefits (e.g., winning a contract) outweigh the costs (e.g., fines, reputational damage). This perspective relies heavily on Principal-Agent theory [cite: 11].
2.  **Institutional Theory:** Suggests that corruption is shaped by the "rules of the game." In countries with weak formal institutions, corruption becomes an institutionalized practice necessary for survival [cite: 4, 11].
3.  **Cultural Norms:** Posits that corruption is socially embedded. In high-context cultures or those with high power distance, practices labeled as "corruption" by Western standards may be viewed as relationship-building (guanxi, wasta) [cite: 1].
4.  **Moral Failure:** Focuses on the ethical decision-making of individuals and the "normalization of deviance" within organizational cultures [cite: 1, 2].

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

The academic and practical treatment of corruption has undergone a profound transformation over the last half-century.

### 3.1 The Era of "Efficient Corruption" (Pre-1977)
Prior to the late 1970s, corruption was often viewed through a functionalist lens. Economists argued that in developing nations with rigid bureaucracies, bribery could "grease the wheels" of commerce, acting as a market mechanism to bypass red tape [cite: 12, 13]. During this period, many Western nations allowed corporations to deduct foreign bribes as legitimate business expenses [cite: 10].

### 3.2 The Regulatory Turning Point: FCPA (1977)
The enactment of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in 1977 marked a watershed moment. Following the Watergate scandal and revelations that over 400 US companies had bribed foreign officials, the US criminalized extraterritorial bribery [cite: 3, 14]. For two decades, the US stood largely alone, leading American firms to complain of a competitive disadvantage.

### 3.3 Globalization of Anti-Corruption (1997–Present)
The landscape shifted in 1997 with the adoption of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions [cite: 2, 15]. This compelled signatory nations to criminalize foreign bribery, leveling the playing field. Subsequent milestones include the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) and the UK Bribery Act (2010), which introduced the strict liability offense of "failure to prevent bribery," forcing companies to implement robust compliance programs [cite: 16, 17].

## 4. The "Grease vs. Sand" Debate

A central theme in IB literature is the economic impact of corruption on firm performance and economic growth.

### 4.1 The "Grease the Wheels" Hypothesis
Proponents argue that corruption can enhance efficiency in countries with weak governance by allowing firms to circumvent cumbersome regulations. Empirical studies have found limited support for this in specific contexts, suggesting that bribery can speed up processes like obtaining permits in highly bureaucratic regimes [cite: 12, 18]. For instance, some research indicates that "greasing" may facilitate innovation in the short term by removing administrative barriers for firms that can afford to pay [cite: 18].

### 4.2 The "Sand the Wheels" Hypothesis
The dominant view in modern research is that corruption "sands the wheels." It increases transaction costs, introduces uncertainty, and reduces the return on investment [cite: 19, 20]. Corruption distorts public expenditure, discourages Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), and acts as an arbitrary tax. Empirical evidence overwhelmingly suggests that corruption hinders long-term economic development and firm growth [cite: 20, 21]. Furthermore, firms that pay bribes often face *higher* costs of capital and spend *more* management time negotiating with bureaucrats, debunking the efficiency argument [cite: 21, 22].

## 5. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

Researching illicit activity presents unique methodological challenges. The field has evolved from macro-level analysis to more granular approaches.

### 5.1 Perception-Based Indices
For decades, the literature relied heavily on aggregate indices like Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) and the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) [cite: 23, 24].
*   **Strengths:** Broad coverage, longitudinal data, ease of use for cross-country regressions.
*   **Weaknesses:** They measure *perception*, not actual experience. They are subject to ideological bias and may lag behind real-world changes [cite: 19, 23].

### 5.2 Firm-Level Surveys
To overcome perception bias, researchers increasingly use experience-based surveys, such as the World Bank Enterprise Surveys (WBES) and the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) [cite: 25, 26]. These instruments ask firms specific questions about "informal payments" required to "get things done."
*   **Advantages:** Direct measurement of bribery incidence and intensity; allows for analysis of firm-level determinants (e.g., size, ownership) [cite: 22, 27].

### 5.3 Experimental Economics
A growing stream of research employs laboratory and field experiments to isolate the micro-foundations of corrupt behavior [cite: 28, 29]. These studies simulate bribery scenarios to test variables such as monitoring, wages, and cultural background.
*   **Key Findings:** Experiments have shown that monitoring can sometimes crowd out intrinsic motivation for honesty, and that individuals from high-corruption countries do not necessarily behave more corruptly in controlled settings, challenging cultural stereotypes [cite: 30].

## 6. Applications and Case Studies

Analyzing major corporate scandals provides granular insight into how corruption is organized and concealed within MNEs.

### 6.1 Siemens: The Compliance Revolution
The Siemens scandal (2006-2008) is the archetype of systemic corporate corruption. The German engineering giant paid over $1.4 billion in bribes to secure contracts worldwide [cite: 7, 31].
*   **Mechanism:** Bribery was institutionalized; "slush funds" were managed via off-book accounts and sham consulting contracts [cite: 32, 33].
*   **Outcome:** Siemens paid a record $1.6 billion in fines to US and German authorities. The case triggered a massive restructuring of Siemens' internal controls and is widely credited with sparking the modern era of rigorous corporate compliance [cite: 7, 34].

### 6.2 Odebrecht: The Industrialization of Bribery
The Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht took corruption to a new level of sophistication by establishing a dedicated "Division of Structured Operations"—effectively a "Department of Bribery" [cite: 35, 36].
*   **Mechanism:** The firm used a complex web of shell companies and off-shore banks to funnel approximately $788 million to officials in 12 countries [cite: 37, 38].
*   **Outcome:** The "Car Wash" (Lava Jato) investigation led to a $2.6 billion fine and the imprisonment of the CEO. The case demonstrated how corruption can capture the highest levels of state power across an entire region [cite: 35, 38].

### 6.3 1MDB: Sovereign Wealth and Kleptocracy
The 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal involved the embezzlement of billions from a sovereign wealth fund [cite: 39, 40].
*   **Mechanism:** Funds intended for development were diverted through offshore shell companies for personal enrichment (luxury real estate, art, film financing). The scandal implicated global financial institutions, notably Goldman Sachs, for facilitating bond issuances despite red flags [cite: 41, 42].
*   **Significance:** This case highlights the role of "gatekeepers" (banks, lawyers, auditors) and the intersection of corruption with money laundering and political elites (Politically Exposed Persons - PEPs) [cite: 39, 43].

### 6.4 Airbus and Glencore: Third-Party Intermediaries
Both the Airbus (2020) and Glencore (2022) settlements underscore the risks of third-party intermediaries. Airbus used consultants to funnel bribes, while Glencore paid over $100 million to intermediaries to secure oil contracts in Africa and South America [cite: 5, 6, 44]. These cases emphasize that MNEs are liable for the actions of their agents.

## 7. Challenges and Open Problems

Despite progress, the field faces significant hurdles:
1.  **Measurement Validity:** The reliance on proxies (CPI) remains problematic. Self-reporting in surveys suffers from social desirability bias [cite: 23, 45].
2.  **Theory-Practice Gap:** Academic research often lags behind the sophisticated schemes used by practitioners (e.g., crypto-laundering).
3.  **Western Bias:** Much of the literature is grounded in Western normative frameworks, potentially misinterpreting gift-giving cultures in emerging markets [cite: 3, 4].
4.  **The "Demand Side":** Most research focuses on the supply side (firms paying bribes). The demand side (public officials soliciting bribes) is harder to study but equally critical [cite: 2].

## 8. Future Research Directions

The landscape of IB corruption is shifting due to technological disruption and changing governance standards. We propose the following research agenda:

### 8.1 Digitalization: The Double-Edged Sword
Digitalization offers conflicting potentials. On one hand, e-government initiatives can reduce corruption by removing human discretion from procurement and licensing [cite: 46, 47]. On the other hand, digitalization creates new avenues for "cyber-corruption" and sophisticated financial crimes [cite: 9].
*   **Research Question:** Under what institutional conditions does digitalization reduce corruption versus merely displacing it to new channels?

### 8.2 Blockchain and Cryptocurrency
Blockchain technology holds promise for supply chain transparency and immutable record-keeping, potentially mitigating corruption risks [cite: 48, 49]. However, cryptocurrencies also facilitate anonymous illicit financial flows and money laundering [cite: 50, 51].
*   **Research Question:** Can blockchain-based smart contracts effectively replace traditional compliance audits in high-risk jurisdictions?
*   **Research Question:** How do MNEs navigate the compliance risks associated with cryptocurrency payments in markets with capital controls? [cite: 52, 53].

### 8.3 ESG and Corruption
Corruption is increasingly viewed as a critical component of the "G" (Governance) in ESG. However, the relationship is complex; some firms with high "E" and "S" scores still engage in bribery [cite: 54, 55].
*   **Research Question:** How does corruption exposure affect a firm's ESG ratings?
*   **Research Question:** Can ESG frameworks be standardized to include robust anti-corruption metrics beyond mere policy disclosure? [cite: 56, 57].

### 8.4 The Role of Intermediaries and Gatekeepers
Given the prominence of intermediaries in recent scandals (Glencore, Airbus), research should focus on the governance of third-party relationships.
*   **Research Question:** What governance mechanisms are most effective in monitoring third-party agents in distance markets?

## 9. Conclusion

Corruption in international business remains a dynamic and pernicious force. This review highlights that while the legal and regulatory frameworks have hardened significantly since the 1970s, the methods of corruption have evolved in complexity. The field has moved beyond the simplistic "grease the wheels" debate to a more nuanced understanding of corruption as a systemic institutional failure.

The future of corruption research lies at the intersection of technology and governance. As MNEs navigate an increasingly digital and transparent world, scholars must investigate how tools like blockchain and AI can be leveraged for integrity, while simultaneously understanding the new risks they introduce. Furthermore, integrating anti-corruption efforts into the broader ESG agenda offers a promising pathway to institutionalize integrity as a core component of sustainable business strategy.
