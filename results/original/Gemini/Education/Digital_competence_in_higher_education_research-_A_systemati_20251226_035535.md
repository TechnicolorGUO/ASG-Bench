# Digital Competence in Higher Education Research: A Systematic Literature Review

### Key Points
*   **Concept Evolution:** Digital competence has evolved from technical computer literacy to a holistic concept encompassing critical thinking, information management, content creation, and ethical participation in society.
*   **Framework Dominance:** The European Commission’s frameworks (DigComp and DigCompEdu) are the most prevalent theoretical models used to benchmark competence in Higher Education (HE), though the TPACK model remains relevant for pedagogical integration.
*   **Assessment Gap:** There is a heavy reliance on self-assessment instruments (questionnaires) in current research. Evidence suggests a discrepancy between self-perceived skills and actual performance, highlighting a need for more objective, performance-based evaluation methods.
*   **Teacher vs. Student Competence:** While early research focused on students ("digital natives"), recent trends emphasize the critical gap in faculty competence. Without digitally competent educators, the integration of technology into pedagogy remains superficial.
*   **The AI Frontier:** The emergence of Generative AI has disrupted the field, necessitating new frameworks (e.g., UNESCO 2024) that integrate AI literacy with traditional digital competence, focusing on ethics and human-centered mindsets.

## 1. Introduction

The rapid digitization of society has fundamentally altered the landscape of Higher Education (HE). No longer a peripheral skill, digital competence has become a prerequisite for academic success, employability, and active citizenship in the 21st century [cite: 1, 2]. The integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into educational environments has shifted from a technical novelty to a structural necessity, a transition accelerated dramatically by the COVID-19 pandemic [cite: 2, 3].

Despite the ubiquity of digital tools, the assumption that university students—often labeled "digital natives"—possess inherent academic digital competence has been challenged by empirical evidence [cite: 4, 5]. Simultaneously, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) face the dual challenge of upskilling faculty to teach *with* technology (pedagogical digital competence) and preparing students to work *in* a digitalized economy [cite: 6, 7].

This systematic literature review synthesizes research on digital competence in HE. It examines the evolution of definitions, the frameworks guiding policy and practice, the methods used to assess competence, and the emerging challenges posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI). The review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the field's current state, identifying critical gaps between policy rhetoric and educational reality.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

### 2.1. Defining Digital Competence
The terminology surrounding digital skills is complex and often fragmented. In the literature, terms such as "digital literacy," "ICT skills," "media literacy," and "digital competence" are frequently used interchangeably, though they possess distinct nuances [cite: 8, 9].

*   **Digital Literacy vs. Digital Competence:** Research indicates a geographical and disciplinary divide. "Digital literacy" is more commonly used in English-speaking countries (UK, USA) and emphasizes the cognitive ability to read, interpret, and produce media. In contrast, "digital competence" is favored in continental Europe and policy contexts, often implying a broader set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes [cite: 8, 10].
*   **Holistic Definitions:** Early definitions focused on technical proficiency (instrumental skills). However, current consensus defines digital competence as a multidimensional construct. It involves the confident, critical, and responsible use of digital technologies for learning, work, and societal participation [cite: 11, 12]. It encompasses not just technical operation but also information management, communication, content creation, safety, and problem-solving [cite: 9, 13].

### 2.2. The "Boundary Concept"
Ilomäki et al. describe digital competence as a "boundary concept"—a flexible term that adapts to different contexts (political, educational, technological) [cite: 14]. This flexibility allows it to serve as a bridge between policy goals (economic growth, employability) and educational practices (curriculum design, assessment), although it can also lead to conceptual ambiguity in research [cite: 15, 16].

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

The trajectory of digital competence research in HE can be categorized into three distinct phases, reflecting the changing nature of technology and society.

### 3.1. Phase I: Instrumental Skills (Pre-2010)
In the early stages, research focused on "computer literacy" and "IT skills." The primary concern was access to infrastructure (the first digital divide) and the technical ability to operate hardware and software [cite: 1, 9]. Milestones in this era included the introduction of basic ICT standards and the initial integration of computers into university labs. The focus was largely on the *tool* rather than the *pedagogy* [cite: 8].

### 3.2. Phase II: Information and Media Literacy (2010–2017)
As the internet became ubiquitous, the focus shifted to handling information. The concept of "21st-century skills" gained prominence, highlighting collaboration, communication, and critical thinking [cite: 15, 17].
*   **The DigComp Framework (2013):** A major milestone was the European Commission's release of the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens (DigComp). It standardized the definition into five key areas: Information/Data Literacy, Communication/Collaboration, Digital Content Creation, Safety, and Problem Solving [cite: 16, 18]. This framework became the de facto standard for measuring competence in Europe and beyond.

### 3.3. Phase III: Pedagogical Integration and AI (2017–Present)
The current phase is characterized by a focus on professionalization and advanced technologies.
*   **DigCompEdu (2017):** Recognizing that teachers require specialized skills, the European Framework for the Digital Competence of Educators (DigCompEdu) was launched. It moved beyond personal digital skills to focus on *pedagogical* competencies—how to use digital tools to empower learners [cite: 7, 19].
*   **The COVID-19 Catalyst:** The pandemic forced a rapid, often chaotic, shift to emergency remote teaching. This period highlighted severe deficits in faculty digital competence and accelerated the adoption of digital pedagogies [cite: 2, 3].
*   **The AI Era (2023–Present):** The release of generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) prompted UNESCO to release the "AI Competency Framework for Teachers" in 2024, marking a new milestone where digital competence must now include AI literacy, ethics, and human-centered design [cite: 20, 21].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

### 4.1. Theoretical Frameworks
The literature demonstrates a strong reliance on established frameworks to operationalize and measure digital competence.
*   **DigComp & DigCompEdu:** These are the most cited frameworks in HE research. DigCompEdu is particularly dominant in studies regarding faculty development, structuring competence into six areas ranging from "Professional Engagement" to "Facilitating Learners' Digital Competence" [cite: 22, 23].
*   **TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge):** While older, TPACK remains influential in teacher education. It conceptualizes competence at the intersection of technology, pedagogy, and subject matter knowledge [cite: 22, 24].
*   **UNESCO Frameworks:** The recent 2024 AI Competency Framework introduces a matrix of progression (Acquire, Deepen, Create) across dimensions like "Human-centered mindset" and "Ethics of AI," representing the cutting edge of theoretical development [cite: 25, 26].

### 4.2. Assessment Methods
A critical analysis of the literature reveals a significant methodological limitation in how digital competence is measured.
*   **Self-Assessment Dominance:** The vast majority of studies utilize self-report questionnaires (Likert scales) where participants rate their own skills [cite: 18, 27]. Tools like "SELFIEforTEACHERS" are widely used for their scalability and ease of administration [cite: 23, 28].
*   **The Validity Gap:** Research consistently shows a discrepancy between *perceived* competence and *actual* performance. Students often overestimate their skills (the "fluency fallacy"), particularly in critical areas like information evaluation and safety, while possessing high confidence in social media and entertainment use [cite: 29, 30].
*   **Performance-Based Assessment:** There is a growing call for, but limited implementation of, performance-based assessments (e.g., task-based tests, syllabus analysis using machine learning). These objective methods generally reveal lower competence levels than self-reports [cite: 18, 31].

## 5. Applications and Case Studies

### 5.1. Student Competence Profiles
Studies profiling university students reveal a "digital competence gap." While students are proficient in communication and social interaction (digital natives), they often lack advanced academic digital skills such as content creation, problem-solving, and critical information literacy [cite: 2].
*   **Case Study (Spain/Latin America):** Research indicates that university students in these regions often possess only "basic" levels of competence, particularly in safety and problem-solving. Gender differences are observed but inconsistent; some studies suggest males score higher in technical skills, while others find females excel in communication, or find no significant difference [cite: 5, 32, 33].

### 5.2. Faculty Professional Development
The digital competence of educators is identified as the single most significant factor influencing student digital development [cite: 34, 35].
*   **DigCompEdu Implementation:** Case studies in Portugal and Spain have used DigCompEdu to map faculty needs. Results often show that while teachers are comfortable finding resources (Area 2), they struggle with "Empowering Learners" (Area 5) and "Facilitating Learners' Digital Competence" (Area 6) [cite: 28, 36].
*   **Barriers to Adoption:** A systematic review of university teachers identifies lack of time, insufficient training, and inadequate infrastructure as the primary barriers to developing digital competence [cite: 6].

### 5.3. AI Integration in Curricula
Recent case studies are exploring the impact of Generative AI. A study at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) found that specific training in GenAI significantly improved students' critical awareness and academic honesty, moving them from passive consumers to critical users of AI [cite: 37]. This suggests that digital competence curricula must immediately adapt to include "AI literacy" [cite: 38].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

### 6.1. The Policy-Practice Gap
There is a documented disconnect between high-level policy directives (e.g., EU Digital Agenda) and the reality in HE classrooms. While policies frame digital competence as essential for employability, implementation is often fragmented, lacking strategic leadership and funding [cite: 6, 16]. Curricula often fail to integrate digital skills transversally, leaving them isolated in specific "IT" courses [cite: 15].

### 6.2. The "Digital Native" Myth
The persistence of the "digital native" narrative hinders progress. Assuming students are already competent leads institutions to under-invest in necessary digital literacy training. Research confirms that exposure to technology does not equate to competence; students require explicit instruction in *academic* and *professional* digital practices [cite: 4, 39].

### 6.3. Assessment Reliability
The reliance on self-assessment creates data reliability issues. Subjective perceptions are influenced by confidence, gender, and cultural background, making cross-institutional or cross-national comparisons difficult [cite: 18, 27]. The field lacks a standardized, globally accepted *performance-based* instrument for HE [cite: 34].

### 6.4. Inequality and the Digital Divide
Digital competence development is influenced by socio-economic background. Students from lower-income backgrounds or developing regions often face "digital exclusion," not just in access (first-level divide) but in the skills to use technology for empowerment (second-level divide) [cite: 40, 41].

## 7. Future Research Directions

### 7.1. From Digital Competence to AI Literacy
The most urgent research direction is the convergence of digital competence with AI literacy. Future studies must investigate how to transition frameworks like DigComp to accommodate the "human-centered mindset" required for AI interaction [cite: 20, 42]. Research should explore how AI tools can be used as "partners" in learning rather than just tools for content generation [cite: 43].

### 7.2. Longitudinal and Experimental Designs
The field is saturated with cross-sectional, descriptive studies. There is a critical need for longitudinal research to track competence development over a degree program [cite: 33, 44]. Furthermore, experimental studies are needed to test the efficacy of specific training interventions (e.g., gamification, AI-based tutoring) on competence acquisition [cite: 45].

### 7.3. Objective Assessment Tools
Developing and validating scalable, performance-based assessment tools is a priority. Innovations such as using machine learning to analyze course syllabi or student outputs could provide more objective measures of digital integration than surveys [cite: 31].

### 7.4. Discipline-Specific Competence
Moving beyond generic "digital skills," future research should define what digital competence looks like in specific disciplines (e.g., Digital Humanities vs. Computational Biology). Generic frameworks may not capture the specialized nuances required in different professional fields [cite: 18].

## 8. Conclusion

Digital competence in higher education has matured from a focus on technical literacy to a complex, multidimensional requirement for participation in the knowledge society. The literature confirms that neither students nor faculty are "naturally" digitally competent; rather, this competence requires intentional, continuous, and pedagogically grounded development.

While robust frameworks like DigCompEdu provide the necessary theoretical scaffolding, the field is currently hindered by a reliance on subjective assessment methods and a gap between policy ambitions and classroom implementation. The arrival of Generative AI represents a paradigm shift, demanding that HEIs not only teach students how to use digital tools but how to engage with them ethically, critically, and creatively. Addressing these challenges requires a systemic approach: integrating digital skills across the curriculum, investing in objective assessment, and prioritizing faculty development as the catalyst for broader educational transformation.
