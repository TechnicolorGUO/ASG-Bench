# The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Education System in Developing Countries: A Systematic Literature Review

**Abstract**

The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated the most severe disruption to global education in history, affecting approximately 1.6 billion learners at its peak. While the crisis was global, its impact was disproportionately severe in developing countries, where pre-existing structural inequalities, digital divides, and resource constraints exacerbated learning losses. This systematic literature review synthesizes evidence regarding the impact of the pandemic on education systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It critically examines the distinction between "Emergency Remote Teaching" (ERT) and planned online learning, analyzes the "triple shock" to health, economies, and education, and evaluates the efficacy of various intervention modalities ranging from high-tech platforms to low-tech solutions like radio and SMS. Key findings indicate that learning poverty in LMICs potentially increased from 53% to 70%, with a projected loss of $17 trillion in lifetime earnings for the affected generation. Furthermore, the review highlights significant gendered impacts, including increased teenage pregnancy and dropout rates, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. The paper concludes by identifying critical research gaps and proposing future directions for building resilient education systems.

## 1. Introduction and Background

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 forced governments worldwide to implement strict containment measures, including the mass closure of educational institutions. At the height of the crisis, schools in over 190 countries were closed, affecting 94% of the world’s student population [cite: 1, 2]. While developed nations rapidly transitioned to online learning platforms, developing countries faced a multifaceted crisis characterized by a lack of digital infrastructure, limited teacher training, and severe economic constraints.

### 1.1 Research Motivation
Prior to the pandemic, the world was already facing a "learning crisis," with 53% of 10-year-olds in low- and middle-income countries unable to read and understand a simple text—a metric known as "Learning Poverty" [cite: 3, 4]. The pandemic acted as a threat multiplier, exacerbating these pre-existing deficiencies. The motivation for this review stems from the urgent need to understand the magnitude of this "triple shock"—an intersection of health emergencies, economic contraction, and educational stagnation [cite: 2, 5, 6]. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for policymakers to mitigate long-term damages, which the World Bank estimates could cost the current generation of students $17 trillion in lifetime earnings [cite: 7, 8].

### 1.2 Objectives
This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the literature concerning the impact of COVID-19 on education in developing countries. The specific objectives are:
1.  To define and distinguish the pedagogical shifts that occurred, specifically the move to Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT).
2.  To analyze the socioeconomic and gendered impacts of school closures.
3.  To evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art low-tech and high-tech interventions.
4.  To identify challenges, research gaps, and future directions for educational resilience.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

To accurately assess the literature, it is essential to establish precise definitions, particularly regarding the nature of instruction delivered during the pandemic.

### 2.1 Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) vs. Online Learning
A critical distinction in the literature is the difference between well-designed online learning and Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT). Research emphasizes that ERT is a temporary shift of instructional delivery to an alternate mode due to crisis circumstances [cite: 9, 10].
*   **Online Learning:** Characterized by deliberate planning, systematic design, and adequate time for development (often 6–9 months). It focuses on learner engagement, social presence, and robust infrastructure [cite: 9, 11].
*   **Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT):** A rapid, unplanned migration to remote delivery with the primary objective of providing temporary access to instruction. It often lacks the theoretical foundations of online pedagogy and is frequently described as "panicgogy" or a "band-aid" solution [cite: 12, 13, 14].

In developing countries, the conflation of these terms has led to unrealistic expectations and negative perceptions of e-learning, as the ERT experience was often marred by technical failures and lack of preparation [cite: 15, 16].

### 2.2 Learning Poverty
"Learning Poverty" is defined by the World Bank and UNESCO as the percentage of 10-year-old children who cannot read and understand a simple story. This metric serves as a proxy for the quality of education systems. Pre-pandemic, this rate was 53% in LMICs; simulations suggest this could have risen to 70% due to prolonged school closures [cite: 7, 17, 18].

### 2.3 The Triple Shock
The literature describes the impact on education systems as a "triple shock":
1.  **Health Shock:** Direct impact of the virus on communities and the mental health of students/teachers.
2.  **Economic Shock:** Loss of household income leading to reduced ability to pay school fees and increased child labor.
3.  **Education Shock:** School closures and the failure of remote learning modalities to reach the most vulnerable [cite: 5, 6, 19].

---

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

### 3.1 Pre-Pandemic Context
Before 2020, developing countries were already struggling with high student-teacher ratios, poor infrastructure, and significant out-of-school populations. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the learning poverty rate was as high as 86% [cite: 17, 18]. The digital divide was stark; for instance, in Kenya, only 22% of the population had internet access, yet education policies often presumed digital readiness [cite: 20].

### 3.2 Chronology of the Crisis
*   **Phase 1: Rapid Closures (March–May 2020):** Governments mandated immediate closures. In Pakistan, institutions were directed to begin distance learning immediately, despite a lack of readiness [cite: 21]. In Latin America, 144 million students missed nearly five months of school in the initial phase [cite: 5].
*   **Phase 2: Attempted Continuity (June 2020–2021):** Countries scrambled to implement multi-modal learning. Sierra Leone revived radio instruction protocols from the Ebola crisis [cite: 22]. Kenya and Nigeria attempted broadcast lessons, though reach was limited in rural areas [cite: 20, 23].
*   **Phase 3: Uneven Reopening and Recovery (Late 2021–Present):** Schools began to reopen, revealing massive learning losses. The focus shifted to remedial education and "building back better" [cite: 24, 25].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

In the context of developing countries, "state-of-the-art" does not necessarily imply the most advanced technology, but rather the most *effective* methodology given resource constraints. The literature reveals a dichotomy between high-tech failures and low-tech innovations.

### 4.1 High-Tech Solutions and Their Limitations
Universities and elite private schools in developing nations attempted to use Learning Management Systems (LMS), Zoom, and Google Classroom. However, systematic reviews indicate that this approach largely failed for the majority due to:
*   **Infrastructure:** Lack of electricity and reliable internet [cite: 26, 27].
*   **Cost:** High cost of data bundles for students [cite: 26].
*   **Competence:** Low digital literacy among both instructors and learners [cite: 28, 29].
In a study of medical students in the Caribbean, high anxiety was reported due to the instability of these high-tech solutions [cite: 30].

### 4.2 Low-Tech and No-Tech Innovations
The most successful interventions in LMICs leveraged existing, accessible infrastructure.
*   **Radio and Television:** Building on the legacy of Interactive Radio Instruction (IRI), countries like Sierra Leone and Kenya utilized broadcast media. While cost-effective, these methods lacked interactivity and feedback loops [cite: 31, 32].
*   **SMS and Phone-Based Tutoring:** A landmark randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Botswana by Youth Impact (formerly Young 1ove) demonstrated the efficacy of "low-tech" solutions. The study found that weekly SMS messages combined with 20-minute phone tutorials improved learning outcomes by 0.12 standard deviations. This intervention was highly cost-effective and has since been replicated in five countries (India, Kenya, Nepal, Philippines, Uganda) [cite: 33, 34, 35, 36].
*   **Paper-Based Packets:** In regions with zero connectivity, such as rural parts of Latin America and Africa, the distribution of physical learning packets remained the primary method of instruction, though logistical challenges often delayed delivery [cite: 10].

## 5. Applications and Case Studies

### 5.1 Sub-Saharan Africa: The Gendered Impact in Kenya
Kenya provides a critical case study on the intersection of education and gender. Research indicates that school closures led to a spike in teenage pregnancies and early marriages.
*   **Pregnancy and Dropout:** A study in rural western Kenya found that secondary schoolgirls out of school due to COVID-19 had **twice the risk of becoming pregnant** and **three times the risk of dropping out** compared to pre-COVID cohorts [cite: 37, 38].
*   **Re-enrollment:** Approximately 16% of girls and 8% of boys did not return to school upon reopening, citing lack of school fees and pregnancy as primary reasons [cite: 39, 40, 41].

### 5.2 Latin America: Inequality and Mobility in Brazil and Peru
Latin America experienced some of the longest school closures globally.
*   **Intergenerational Mobility:** In Brazil and Peru, the pandemic is projected to reduce absolute upward mobility by nearly 30 percentage points. Children from less-educated parents face a significantly higher risk of not completing secondary education compared to their peers from educated households [cite: 42, 43].
*   **Dropout Rates:** In Chile and Peru, enrollment declined by approximately 5 percentage points, signaling a massive exit of vulnerable youth from the education system [cite: 42].

### 5.3 Sierra Leone: Leveraging Ebola Legacies
Sierra Leone offered a unique application of historical resilience. Having dealt with school closures during the 2014 Ebola epidemic, the government rapidly revitalized its education radio program. This existing institutional memory allowed for a faster deployment of remote learning compared to neighboring countries, although challenges regarding coverage and engagement remained [cite: 22].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

The literature identifies several persistent challenges that hinder the recovery of education systems in developing countries.

### 6.1 The Digital Divide and Infrastructure
The "digital divide" is the most frequently cited challenge. In low-income countries, fewer than 10% of households have internet access. UNESCO reports that 40% of low-income countries provided no support to disadvantaged learners during shutdowns [cite: 1, 20]. This divide is not just about hardware; it encompasses the "soft" infrastructure of digital literacy and technical support [cite: 26, 28].

### 6.2 Mental Health and Psychosocial Well-being
The pandemic inflicted severe psychological distress.
*   **Students:** Studies report high levels of anxiety, depression, and loneliness among students due to isolation and uncertainty about their academic futures [cite: 30, 44, 45]. In a survey of international students, 99% reported significant mental health effects [cite: 46].
*   **Teachers:** Educators faced burnout, stress from adapting to new technologies without training, and anxiety regarding job security. A study across 14 African countries highlighted depression affecting 31% of teachers [cite: 47, 48].

### 6.3 Economic Fallout and Budget Cuts
The economic shock has forced households to cut education spending. Simultaneously, governments facing fiscal crises have reduced education budgets. Two-thirds of low- and lower-middle-income countries cut their education budgets after the onset of the pandemic [cite: 19]. This reduction threatens to create a vicious cycle of underfunding and poor learning outcomes [cite: 49].

### 6.4 Exacerbation of Inequalities
The pandemic acted as an inequality amplifier. Children with disabilities were largely excluded from remote learning plans [cite: 1]. Furthermore, the burden of household chores disproportionately fell on girls during lockdowns, further reducing their learning time [cite: 39, 40].

---

## 7. Future Research Directions

Based on the review, several critical areas require further investigation:

1.  **Longitudinal Impact Studies:** While simulations predict a $17 trillion loss in earnings, empirical longitudinal studies are needed to track the actual economic trajectories of the "COVID generation" over the next decade [cite: 7].
2.  **Efficacy of Hybrid Models in Low-Resource Settings:** As schools reopen, "hybrid" or "blended" learning is being touted as the future. Research is needed to determine how these models can be effectively implemented in regions with intermittent electricity and internet [cite: 24, 50].
3.  **Teacher Resilience and Training:** There is a gap in the literature regarding effective professional development models that can rapidly upskill teachers in digital pedagogy during emergencies [cite: 47, 51].
4.  **Low-Tech Scalability:** The success of the Botswana SMS/phone trial suggests a need for more research on scaling low-tech interventions. Can these methods sustain learning gains in non-emergency contexts? [cite: 34, 36].
5.  **Intersectionality:** More granular data is needed on the impact of the pandemic on specific marginalized groups, including children with disabilities, refugees, and linguistic minorities in developing contexts [cite: 1, 52].

## 8. Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a devastating blow to education systems in developing countries, threatening to reverse decades of progress in access and learning. The distinction between Emergency Remote Teaching and planned online learning reveals that the global response was largely a triage operation, often ill-suited to the realities of the Global South. The "triple shock" of health, economic, and educational crises has exacerbated inequalities, with the most vulnerable—girls, the poor, and the disabled—bearing the heaviest burden.

However, the crisis has also spurred innovation. The success of low-tech interventions, such as the phone-based tutoring models in Botswana, offers a blueprint for resilient, cost-effective education delivery. Moving forward, the focus must shift from emergency response to systemic recovery. This requires urgent investment in infrastructure, teacher mental health and training, and targeted remedial programs to address the alarming rise in learning poverty. Failure to act decisively could result in a lost generation, with profound long-term economic and social consequences for the developing world.
