This systematic literature review examines the state of the field from 2015 to 2025, analyzing empirical studies, theoretical frameworks, and technological advancements. The review synthesizes findings across biology, chemistry, and physics education, distinguishing between superficial gamification (points, badges, leaderboards) and deep, adaptive gamification driven by artificial intelligence. Key findings indicate that while gamification significantly enhances short-term engagement and academic performance, challenges remain regarding long-term knowledge retention, pedagogical integration, and the \"novelty effect.\" The paper identifies a critical shift towards AI-driven adaptive systems and stealth assessment as the future frontier of the field.\n\n---"

      "content": "Science education faces a persistent global challenge: a decline in student motivation and engagement, often attributed to the abstract nature of scientific concepts and traditional, didactic teaching methods [cite: 1, 2]. As scientific literacy becomes increasingly vital for navigating the 21st century, educators and researchers have sought innovative pedagogical interventions. Among these, **gamification**—the application of game design elements in non-game contexts—has gained significant traction [cite: 1, 3].\n\nThe motivation behind this review stems from the rapid evolution of educational technology. Early implementations of gamification were often limited to behaviorist reward systems. However, the proliferation of mobile devices, Virtual Reality (VR), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has expanded the possibilities for immersive and personalized learning experiences [cite: 4, 5].\n\nThis paper provides a comprehensive systematic review of the literature on gamification in science education. The objectives are to: (1) define and distinguish key concepts; (2) trace the historical trajectory of the field; (3) analyze state-of-the-art methods, particularly AI integration; (4) evaluate applications across specific scientific disciplines; and (5) identify critical challenges and future research directions.\n\n---"

The learning activity remains the core, but it is \"wrapped\" in game layers.\n*   **Game-Based Learning (GBL)** involves using actual games (digital or analog) as the primary medium for learning. In GBL, the game *is* the lesson [cite: 4, 8].\n*   **Serious Games** are full-fledged games designed specifically for educational purposes rather than entertainment, often involving simulations of real-world phenomena [cite: 7]."

Gamification facilitates \"flow\" through adaptive difficulty and immediate feedback [cite: 11, 12].\n*   **The ARCS Model:** Focuses on Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction. Gamification strategies are often mapped to these four dimensions to ensure sustained engagement [cite: 13].\n*   **Constructivism:** In science education, gamification often supports constructivist approaches by allowing students to experiment, fail safely, and build knowledge through active inquiry [cite: 14, 15].\n\n---"
