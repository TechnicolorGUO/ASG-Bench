      "content": "The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), epitomized by Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has precipitated a paradigm shift in the educational landscape. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review titled \"Transforming Education,\" synthesizing findings from over 3,800 peer-reviewed articles published between 2022 and 2025. Utilizing both bibliometric mapping and qualitative content analysis, this review delineates the historical trajectory of AI in education, from early Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to current generative models. The bibliometric analysis identifies exponential growth in research output, with dominant contributions from the United States and China, and reveals thematic clusters focusing on higher education, ethics, assessment, and writing support. Content analysis highlights the dual nature of GenAI: while meta-analytic evidence demonstrates significant gains in learning performance and higher-order thinking, substantial challenges remain regarding academic integrity, hallucination, and cognitive offloading. This review concludes by identifying critical research gaps and proposing a roadmap for the responsible integration of GenAI, emphasizing the necessity of AI literacy and human-centric pedagogical frameworks.\n\n---"

Unlike previous educational technologies that focused on content delivery or discriminative analysis, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) possesses the capability to create novel content—text, code, images, and audio—thereby simulating a human-like interlocutor [cite: 1, 2]. This capability has sparked a \"gold rush\" in educational research, necessitating a rigorous synthesis of the rapidly expanding literature [cite: 3]."

These models are designed to classify data or predict outcomes based on existing patterns—for example, identifying at-risk students based on grades or classifying an image as a \"dog\" or \"cat\" [cite: 12, 13]. Discriminative models draw decision boundaries between classes [cite: 14, 15].\n\nIn contrast, **Generative AI** learns the underlying distribution of a dataset to generate *new* data instances that resemble the training data [cite: 14, 16]. In an educational context, this means rather than just grading an essay (discriminative), the AI can write the essay, generate a unique quiz, or engage in a Socratic dialogue with a student [cite: 15, 17]."

However, the risks of cognitive offloading, bias, and academic dishonesty are non-trivial and require immediate pedagogical and policy interventions.\n\nUltimately, the \"transformation\" of education will not be determined by the technology itself, but by how educators adapt to it. The future lies not in replacing human educators, but in evolving the educational model toward a symbiotic relationship where AI augments human intelligence, allowing teachers to focus on the uniquely human aspects of inspiration, mentorship, and ethical guidance.\n\n---"
