      "content": "The prediction of academic success in higher education has transitioned from a peripheral administrative interest to a central strategic imperative for universities worldwide. As higher education institutions face increasing pressure to improve retention rates, optimize resource allocation, and ensure equitable outcomes, the ability to identify students at risk of failure or dropout has become paramount [cite: 1, 2]. The rise of Big Data, Learning Management Systems (LMS), and advanced computational methods has birthed the fields of Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics (LA), which seek to convert vast repositories of student data into actionable intelligence [cite: 3, 4].\n\nThe motivation for this research is multifaceted. At the institutional level, student attrition represents a significant financial loss and a reputational risk. At the individual level, academic failure can have long-term socio-economic consequences for students [cite: 5, 6]. Consequently, researchers have moved beyond merely describing *why* students fail to predicting *who* will fail and *when*, enabling proactive rather than reactive interventions [cite: 7, 8].\n\nHowever, the field faces a \"reproducibility and applicability crisis.\" While algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated—moving from simple regression to complex deep learning architectures—the practical application of these models remains fraught with challenges. These include the lack of a standardized definition of \"success,\" the \"black box\" nature of advanced machine learning models, and the ethical perils of algorithmic bias where models reinforce historical inequities [cite: 9, 10, 11].\n\nThis systematic literature review aims to provide a comprehensive synthesis of the current state of research in predicting academic success. It covers the historical theoretical foundations, defines key constructs, analyzes state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques, and critically examines the ethical and practical challenges that define the current research frontier."

      "level": 3,
      "content": "Historically, academic success was synonymous with academic performance, typically measured by Grade Point Average (GPA) or course completion. However, contemporary literature argues for a more holistic definition. The seminal work by York et al. (2015) provides a comprehensive framework that is widely cited as a best practice for defining the construct. They argue that academic success is comprised of six distinct components:\n1.  **Academic Achievement:** Grades, GPA, and test scores.\n2.  **Satisfaction:** The student's subjective satisfaction with the institution and learning environment.\n3.  **Acquisition of Skills and Competencies:** The development of critical thinking, discipline-specific skills, and soft skills.\n4.  **Persistence:** Retention (re-enrolling the following year) and degree completion.\n5.  **Attainment of Learning Objectives:** Meeting specific curricular goals.\n6.  **Career Success:** Post-college performance and employability [cite: 2, 12, 13].\n\nDespite this nuanced definition, the majority of EDM research still relies heavily on **Academic Achievement** (grades) and **Persistence** (retention) because these metrics are readily available in institutional databases [cite: 2, 14]. Best practices now dictate that researchers explicitly state which dimension of success they are modeling, as predictors for GPA may differ significantly from predictors for student satisfaction or retention [cite: 15]."

EDM focuses on the development of methods for exploring unique types of data that come from educational settings (e.g., developing new algorithms).

This review encompasses both, as the *methods* of EDM are often the engine for the *applications* of LA."

      "content": "Before the advent of large-scale computing, prediction was grounded in sociological and psychological theory. The most influential framework is **Tinto’s Student Integration Model** (1975, 1993). Tinto posited that persistence is a function of the match between a student’s motivation/academic ability and the institution’s social/academic environment. He argued that \"social integration\" (belonging) and \"academic integration\" (performance) are the primary drivers of retention [cite: 16, 17, 18].\n\nParallel to Tinto, **Bean and Metzner (1985)** developed the Student Attrition Model, which focused specifically on non-traditional students. They emphasized environmental factors external to the university (e.g., family responsibilities, finances, employment) as critical predictors of success, arguing that for many students, external pressures outweigh internal integration [cite: 19]. These theories remain relevant today as they inform *feature selection*—the process of deciding which variables (e.g., demographics, financial aid, LMS interaction) to feed into modern algorithms [cite: 20, 21]."

These models were highly interpretable; they could tell an administrator that \"for every 1-point increase in high school GPA, the probability of college graduation increases by X%.\" However, these models often failed to capture complex, non-linear relationships in student data and generally suffered from lower predictive accuracy compared to modern methods [cite: 2, 22]."

Random Forest, an ensemble method, is frequently cited as a top performer for tabular data (demographics + grades). It handles non-linear data well and provides feature importance metrics, making it semi-interpretable [cite: 3, 10, 24].\n*   **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** SVMs are effective for smaller datasets with high dimensionality. Several studies have shown SVM to outperform regression in classifying students as \"pass\" or \"fail\" [cite: 25, 26].\n*   **Logistic Regression (LR):** While older, LR is still used as a baseline. It is often preferred when the primary goal is *inference* (understanding the relationship between variables) rather than pure prediction, or when data is scarce [cite: 22, 27].\n*   **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM):** In recent years, gradient boosting machines have often outperformed Random Forests in competitions and benchmarks, providing state-of-the-art accuracy for structured educational data [cite: 27, 28, 29]."

They can model a student's trajectory week-by-week. Research indicates that LSTM models significantly outperform static models by identifying patterns in *when* and *how* students engage with material over time [cite: 30, 31, 32].\n*   **Hybrid CNN-LSTM Models:** A growing body of literature supports the use of hybrid architectures. In these models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used to extract spatial features from data (or complex interaction patterns), which are then fed into LSTMs to model temporal dependencies. Studies using Blackboard and Moodle data have shown that CNN-LSTM architectures achieve superior accuracy (often >90%) compared to standalone CNN or LSTM models [cite: 33, 34, 35, 36].\n*   **Transformers:** Emerging research is beginning to apply Transformer architectures (the basis of Large Language Models) to student data, utilizing attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of specific interactions in predicting outcomes [cite: 30]."

For example, combining gameplay behavior with facial expression data improves the prediction of post-test performance and student interest in game-based learning environments [cite: 37, 38, 39].\n*   **Techniques:** Cross-attention mechanisms are used to fuse these disparate data sources, allowing the model to \"attend\" to the most salient modality (e.g., a confused facial expression) at a specific moment [cite: 38]."
