Evidence suggests a discrepancy between self-perceived skills and actual performance, highlighting a need for more objective, performance-based evaluation methods.\n*   **Teacher vs. Student Competence:** While early research focused on students (\"digital natives\"), recent trends emphasize the critical gap in faculty competence. Without digitally competent educators, the integration of technology into pedagogy remains superficial.\n*   **The AI Frontier:** The emergence of Generative AI has disrupted the field, necessitating new frameworks (e.g., UNESCO 2024) that integrate AI literacy with traditional digital competence, focusing on ethics and human-centered mindsets.\n\n---"

      "content": "The rapid digitization of society has fundamentally altered the landscape of Higher Education (HE). No longer a peripheral skill, digital competence has become a prerequisite for academic success, employability, and active citizenship in the 21st century [cite: 1, 2]. The integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into educational environments has shifted from a technical novelty to a structural necessity, a transition accelerated dramatically by the COVID-19 pandemic [cite: 2, 3].\n\nDespite the ubiquity of digital tools, the assumption that university students—often labeled \"digital natives\"—possess inherent academic digital competence has been challenged by empirical evidence [cite: 4, 5]. Simultaneously, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) face the dual challenge of upskilling faculty to teach *with* technology (pedagogical digital competence) and preparing students to work *in* a digitalized economy [cite: 6, 7].\n\nThis systematic literature review synthesizes research on digital competence in HE. It examines the evolution of definitions, the frameworks guiding policy and practice, the methods used to assess competence, and the emerging challenges posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI). The review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the field's current state, identifying critical gaps between policy rhetoric and educational reality."

      "content": "The terminology surrounding digital skills is complex and often fragmented. In the literature, terms such as \"digital literacy,\" \"ICT skills,\" \"media literacy,\" and \"digital competence\" are frequently used interchangeably, though they possess distinct nuances [cite: 8, 9].\n\n*   **Digital Literacy vs. Digital Competence:** Research indicates a geographical and disciplinary divide. \"Digital literacy\" is more commonly used in English-speaking countries (UK, USA) and emphasizes the cognitive ability to read, interpret, and produce media. In contrast, \"digital competence\" is favored in continental Europe and policy contexts, often implying a broader set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes [cite: 8, 10].\n*   **Holistic Definitions:** Early definitions focused on technical proficiency (instrumental skills). However, current consensus defines digital competence as a multidimensional construct. It involves the confident, critical, and responsible use of digital technologies for learning, work, and societal participation [cite: 11, 12]. It encompasses not just technical operation but also information management, communication, content creation, safety, and problem-solving [cite: 9, 13]."

The concept of \"21st-century skills\" gained prominence, highlighting collaboration, communication, and critical thinking [cite: 15, 17].\n*   **The DigComp Framework (2013):** A major milestone was the European Commission's release of the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens (DigComp). It standardized the definition into five key areas: Information/Data Literacy, Communication/Collaboration, Digital Content Creation, Safety, and Problem Solving [cite: 16, 18]. This framework became the de facto standard for measuring competence in Europe and beyond."

It moved beyond personal digital skills to focus on *pedagogical* competencies—how to use digital tools to empower learners [cite: 7, 19].\n*   **The COVID-19 Catalyst:** The pandemic forced a rapid, often chaotic, shift to emergency remote teaching. This period highlighted severe deficits in faculty digital competence and accelerated the adoption of digital pedagogies [cite: 2, 3].\n*   **The AI Era (2023–Present):** The release of generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) prompted UNESCO to release the \"AI Competency Framework for Teachers\" in 2024, marking a new milestone where digital competence must now include AI literacy, ethics, and human-centered design [cite: 20, 21]."

It conceptualizes competence at the intersection of technology, pedagogy, and subject matter knowledge [cite: 22, 24].\n*   **UNESCO Frameworks:** The recent 2024 AI Competency Framework introduces a matrix of progression (Acquire, Deepen, Create) across dimensions like \"Human-centered mindset\" and \"Ethics of AI,\" representing the cutting edge of theoretical development [cite: 25, 26]."

Tools like \"SELFIEforTEACHERS\" are widely used for their scalability and ease of administration [cite: 23, 28].\n*   **The Validity Gap:** Research consistently shows a discrepancy between *perceived* competence and *actual* performance. Students often overestimate their skills (the \"fluency fallacy\"), particularly in critical areas like information evaluation and safety, while possessing high confidence in social media and entertainment use [cite: 29, 30].\n*   **Performance-Based Assessment:** There is a growing call for, but limited implementation of, performance-based assessments (e.g., task-based tests, syllabus analysis using machine learning). These objective methods generally reveal lower competence levels than self-reports [cite: 18, 31]."

The literature confirms that neither students nor faculty are \"naturally\" digitally competent; rather, this competence requires intentional, continuous, and pedagogically grounded development.\n\nWhile robust frameworks like DigCompEdu provide the necessary theoretical scaffolding, the field is currently hindered by a reliance on subjective assessment methods and a gap between policy ambitions and classroom implementation. The arrival of Generative AI represents a paradigm shift, demanding that HEIs not only teach students how to use digital tools but how to engage with them ethically, critically, and creatively. Addressing these challenges requires a systemic approach: integrating digital skills across the curriculum, investing in objective assessment, and prioritizing faculty development as the catalyst for broader educational transformation."
