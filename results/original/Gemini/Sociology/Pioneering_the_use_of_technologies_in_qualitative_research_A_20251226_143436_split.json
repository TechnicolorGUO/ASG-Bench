This systematic literature review examines the evolution, methodology, and implications of digital interviewing. It traces the historical trajectory from early asynchronous email exchanges to the ubiquity of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and finally to the pioneering frontiers of Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) moderated data collection. The review synthesizes findings from seminal and contemporary studies to evaluate the efficacy, ethical complexity, and epistemological shifts associated with these technologies. While digital interviews offer unprecedented access to geographically dispersed and marginalized populations, they introduce distinct challenges regarding rapport, non-verbal communication, and the digital divide. The paper concludes that digital interviewing is no longer merely a logistical compromise but a distinct methodological sub-field requiring specialized ethical frameworks and technical competencies."

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Qualitative research has traditionally held the face-to-face (FtF) interview as the \"gold standard\" for data collection, prized for its ability to capture the nuances of body language, environmental context, and immediate rapport [cite: 1, 2]. However, the rapid digitization of society, coupled with global disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, has necessitated a paradigm shift. Researchers have been compelled to pioneer the use of technologies to conduct interviews, moving from viewing digital methods as a \"second-best\" alternative to recognizing them as a robust, standalone methodological approach [cite: 1, 3].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the explosion of technological tools available to the qualitative researcher. What began as simple text-based email exchanges has evolved into immersive metaverse interactions and AI-driven automated interviewing systems. This review aims to consolidate the fragmented literature on digital interviews, offering a comprehensive analysis of how technology shapes the research relationship and the data generated.\n\nThe objectives of this paper are threefold:\n1.  To map the historical development of digital interviewing from text-based origins to immersive virtual realities.\n2.  To critically evaluate state-of-the-art methods, including mobile ethnography, VR, and AI, assessing their strengths and limitations compared to traditional methods.\n3.  To identify ethical and methodological gaps that must be addressed as the field moves toward increasingly automated and immersive data collection."

Technologies include telephone interviews and VoIP video conferencing platforms like Skype, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams [cite: 2, 4]. These methods preserve the immediacy of response and allow for real-time probing.\n*   **Asynchronous Interviews:** These do not occur in real-time. Participants respond to prompts at their own convenience. This category includes email interviews, mobile ethnography apps (e.g., Indeemo, dscout), and text-based messaging platforms [cite: 5, 6]. Asynchronous methods are characterized by \"time-lagged\" interactions, allowing for more reflective and curated responses from participants [cite: 5]."

Mann and Stewart (2000) provided seminal work on internet communication, exploring how computer-mediated communication (CMC) could be utilized for qualitative inquiry [cite: 9, 10]. During this period, email interviewing emerged as a novel technique. Opdenakker (2006) and Meho (2006) were pivotal in defining the advantages of asynchronous email interviews, noting their ability to eliminate transcription costs and allow participants to reflect deeply before answering [cite: 11, 12, 13]. However, these early methods were often criticized for the complete loss of social cues and spontaneous reaction [cite: 14]."

Features such as screen sharing and automatic recording/transcription have streamlined the analytical process [cite: 18].\n*   **Rapport:** Contrary to early skepticism, recent studies suggest that rapport can be established effectively online, particularly when participants are in their own comfortable environments (e.g., home), which may balance power dynamics between researcher and researched [cite: 16, 20]."

There is a risk that sensitive interview data could be accessed by platform providers or used to train AI models without explicit participant consent [cite: 37, 38].\n*   **AI Ethics:** The use of AI interviewers introduces the \"black box\" problem.

They represent a distinct mode of communication with their own logic, rules, and ethical requirements [cite: 1, 3]. The shift to digital has democratized research access but also erected new barriers regarding the digital divide.\n\nAs we look to the future, the integration of AI and VR promises to further blur the lines between the physical and the virtual. The successful qualitative researcher of the future will need to be a \"methodological technologist,\" capable of navigating the technical, ethical, and interpersonal complexities of the digital realm to uncover the human experience."
