Originating from Black feminist legal theory, intersectionality has evolved into a critical paradigm for understanding how overlapping systems of power shape collective action. This paper surveys the historical development of the field, distinguishes between structural and political intersectionality, and evaluates state-of-the-art methodological approaches, ranging from ethnographic discourse analysis to novel quantitative techniques like network analysis and multilevel modeling. Through an analysis of diverse case studies—including the Women’s March, Black Lives Matter, and labor movements in the Global South—this review identifies the mechanisms through which intersectional solidarity is constructed or inhibited. The paper concludes by highlighting persistent challenges in quantitative operationalization and offering future research directions regarding digital activism and the decentering of Global North epistemologies.\n\n---"

      "content": "Social movements are rarely monolithic; they are composed of actors occupying distinct social locations defined by race, class, gender, sexuality, and ability. For decades, social movement scholarship struggled to account for these internal heterogeneities, often treating movements as unitary actors or prioritizing a single axis of oppression. However, the integration of **intersectionality**—the understanding that systems of oppression are interlocking and mutually reinforcing—has fundamentally reshaped the study of contentious politics [cite: 1, 2].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the increasing necessity to understand how diverse groups form political alliances in an era of fragmented identity politics. As Silke Roth argues, intersectionality matters for all social movements, not merely as a descriptor of identity, but as both an analytic tool and a political strategy for coalition building [cite: 1]. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of how intersectionality is operationalized in social movement research. It explores how \"political intersectionality\" facilitates or hinders coalitions, how researchers measure these dynamics, and where the field is heading."

In the context of social movements, this concept describes the paradox where individuals belonging to two political constituencies (e.g., a labor union and a civil rights group) find their specific interests addressed by neither [cite: 3, 4]."

It is also an internal process within a single movement where diverse subgroups negotiate power. **Intersectional solidarity** is defined as an ongoing process of creating ties across social group differences by negotiating power asymmetries, rather than assuming a pre-existing unity [cite: 5, 6]. This requires \"intersectional consciousness\"—the awareness of movement organizers to differing inequalities and discrepancies of power and privilege within their own ranks [cite: 7, 8]."

Early formulations are found in the 19th-century speeches of Sojourner Truth and Maria Stewart, who articulated the unique position of Black women [cite: 2, 11].

This has been particularly effective in studying environmental and disability rights movements in the UK, revealing how intersectional language is often adopted by grassroots groups but ignored by professional NGOs [cite: 11]."

A systematic review of quantitative methods from 1989 to 2020 found that the majority of studies still rely on simple regression with interaction terms, which often fails to capture the structural nature of power [cite: 19, 20].\n\nHowever, state-of-the-art techniques are emerging:\n*   **MAIHDA (Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy):** This method models individuals nested within intersectional strata (e.g., Black working-class women), allowing researchers to partition variance and quantify the specific effect of the intersection beyond the sum of its parts [cite: 21].\n*   **Network Analysis:** Recent studies have applied network science to map coalitions. For instance, an analysis of the \"New Rights Agenda\" in Uruguay used network surveys to visualize how feminist, LGBTQ+, and Afro-descendant organizations formed an integrated structure with specific \"bridge-builder\" organizations [cite: 22]. Similarly, Twitter hashtag analysis (#BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo) uses network co-occurrence to visualize digital coalitions [cite: 16].\n*   **Decision Trees (CART/CHAID):** These data-driven methods identify which intersections of identity are most predictive of an outcome (e.g., participation in protests) without imposing a priori assumptions about which categories matter most [cite: 21]."

While it was the largest single-day protest in US history, it faced immediate criticism for its initial white-centric leadership.

Participants’ motivations were often siloed; for example, white women were motivated by reproductive rights, while Black participants were significantly more likely to cite racial justice [cite: 17].

      "content": "Intersectionality has transitioned from a legal theory to an indispensable paradigm in social movement research. It reveals that coalitions are not merely strategic alliances between groups but are sites of struggle where power, privilege, and identity are negotiated. The literature demonstrates that while intersectionality poses challenges—methodological complexity, internal friction, and risk of co-optation—it offers the only viable framework for understanding collective action in a stratified world.\n\nThe \"state of the art\" is moving toward a synthesis of deep qualitative insight and sophisticated quantitative modeling. By embracing complexity, acknowledging the \"matrix of domination,\" and expanding the geographical scope of inquiry, social movement scholars can better understand how activists build power across difference. As Roth concludes, intersectionality is not just an analytic strategy for researchers; it is a political imperative for movements seeking transformative social justice [cite: 1].\n\n---"
