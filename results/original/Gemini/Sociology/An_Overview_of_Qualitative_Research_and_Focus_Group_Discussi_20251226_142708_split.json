Tracing the trajectory of the field from the seminal works of Robert Merton and Paul Lazarsfeld in the 1940s to the contemporary integration of Artificial Intelligence and synthetic participants, this paper synthesizes current state-of-the-art practices. The review analyzes the epistemological foundations of qualitative inquiry, distinguishes FGDs from group interviews, and explores the methodological rigors of data collection and analysis, including Grounded Theory and Thematic Analysis. Furthermore, it critically evaluates ethical challenges unique to group settings—specifically confidentiality and consent—and addresses cross-cultural applications. Finally, the paper identifies emerging research gaps and future directions, particularly the controversial yet burgeoning use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic focus groups, positing that while technology offers efficiency, the human element of social interaction remains the cornerstone of valid qualitative inquiry.\n\n---"

      "content": "Qualitative research has established itself as a vital paradigm in the social sciences, business, and health sectors, offering descriptive and interpretative power that quantitative methods often lack. Unlike quantitative research, which seeks to quantify variables and generalize results to larger populations through numerical data, qualitative research focuses on understanding the \"why\" and \"how\" of human behavior, exploring the depth of attitudes, beliefs, and social interactions [cite: 1, 2]. Among the arsenal of qualitative tools—which includes in-depth interviews, participant observation, and case studies—the Focus Group Discussion (FGD) stands out as a unique method that leverages group dynamics to generate data.\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the evolving landscape of social research. While FGDs have been a staple of methodology for decades, the digital revolution and the recent advent of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) are reshaping how these discussions are conceived, conducted, and analyzed. Furthermore, the democratization of research tools has led to a proliferation of FGDs in non-academic settings, necessitating a rigorous review of best practices to maintain methodological integrity.\n\nThe objectives of this paper are threefold: (1) to provide a historical and theoretical grounding of FGDs within the broader qualitative framework; (2) to critically analyze current methodologies, ethical constraints, and applications; and (3) to explore the frontier of \"synthetic\" research and virtual modalities. By synthesizing literature from sociology, marketing, and healthcare, this review aims to bridge the gap between traditional sociological roots and modern technological applications.\n\n---"

      "content": "Qualitative research is an inquiry process of understanding based on distinct methodological traditions of inquiry that explore a social or human problem. It is fundamentally exploratory, aiming to reveal the meaning individuals ascribe to a social or human problem [cite: 1]. As noted by Mohajan (2018), qualitative research provides a \"richer and better understanding of society under investigation\" by focusing on non-numerical data and the \"nature\" of the event or condition [cite: 2]. It is particularly adept at uncovering complex social phenomena where variables are difficult to isolate or quantify."

      "content": "A Focus Group Discussion is defined as a \"carefully planned discussion designed to obtain perceptions on a defined area of interest in a permissive, non-threatening environment\" [cite: 3, 4]. The core characteristic that distinguishes an FGD from other methods is the explicit use of **group interaction** as part of the data generation method. Participants are encouraged to talk to one another, asking questions, exchanging anecdotes, and commenting on each other's experiences and points of view [cite: 5, 6].\n\nKey characteristics of a standard FGD include:\n*   **Size:** Typically 6–10 participants, though \"mini-focus groups\" may have fewer [cite: 7, 8].\n*   **Composition:** Participants usually share specific characteristics (homogeneity) relevant to the topic to promote comfortable disclosure [cite: 9, 10].\n*   **Moderation:** Led by a facilitator who guides the discussion using a semi-structured guide but allows the conversation to flow naturally [cite: 11, 12]."

      "level": 3,
      "content": "A critical conceptual distinction exists between a \"focus group\" and a \"group interview,\" though the terms are often used interchangeably in loose parlance. In a **group interview**, the researcher asks questions of individuals in a group setting, and the interaction is primarily between the interviewer and the participant (Researcher $\\leftrightarrow$ Participant). The goal is often efficiency—collecting individual responses faster than one-on-one interviews [cite: 12, 13].\n\nIn contrast, a **focus group** relies on the interaction *between* participants (Participant $\\leftrightarrow$ Participant). The researcher acts as a moderator or facilitator, and the data produced is the result of the \"synergistic effect\" or \"piggybacking,\" where one participant's comment triggers a chain reaction of responses from others [cite: 6, 14]. As noted in recent methodological comparisons, researchers choose group interviews when they want individual data points without the \"contamination\" of group influence, whereas they choose focus groups when they want to observe how opinions are formed and negotiated socially [cite: 13].\n\n---"

      "content": "The intellectual roots of the focus group are traced to the collaboration between sociologists **Robert Merton** and **Paul Lazarsfeld** at Columbia University’s Bureau of Applied Social Research during World War II [cite: 15, 16]. In November 1941, Lazarsfeld invited Merton to observe a session testing audience reactions to radio programs. Participants pressed buttons to indicate positive or negative responses (a quantitative measure), but Merton was fascinated by the subsequent discussion where participants explained *why* they reacted that way [cite: 17, 18].\n\nMerton, along with Marjorie Fiske and Patricia Kendall, formalized this method to analyze the effectiveness of wartime propaganda and training films for the U.S. Army [cite: 19, 20]. They coined the term \"focused interview\" because the interview focused on a specific, concrete situation (e.g., watching a film) that all participants had experienced. Their seminal work, *The Focused Interview* (1956), established the criteria of non-direction, specificity, range, and depth [cite: 16, 19]."

However, the business world embraced it. In the 1950s, prompted by the rise of consumerism, marketing researchers adopted the technique to understand consumer preferences for products like soap and cars [cite: 3, 20]. Psychologist **Ernest Dichter** is often credited with coining the term \"focus group\" during this period, emphasizing its utility in uncovering subconscious consumer motivations [cite: 21]. For decades, the focus group was almost exclusively associated with commercial market research."

They adapted the marketing style of focus groups for social science applications, such as health assessments and program evaluations. Merton himself, writing in 1987, noted the \"obliteration by incorporation\" of his original work, expressing surprise at how the method had evolved (and sometimes devolved) in the hands of market researchers [cite: 15, 22]. Since then, FGDs have become a cornerstone of qualitative inquiry in public health, education, and sociology.\n\n---"

Techniques include direct questioning of silent members and using body language to shift focus [cite: 5, 11].\n*   **Projective Techniques:** To bypass social desirability bias, moderators may use indirect methods like role-playing, drawing, or sentence completion to elicit deeper emotional responses [cite: 8, 25]."

The integration of digital tools and AI offers unprecedented efficiency but threatens to strip away the messy, unpredictable human elements that make qualitative research valuable. While synthetic users and AI coding can augment the researcher's toolkit, they cannot replace the empathetic understanding of a skilled moderator or the nuanced interpretation of a human analyst.\n\nFuture research must rigorously test the validity of these new technologies while upholding the ethical standards established over the last century. As the method continues to adapt, the core objective remains unchanged: to listen to the voices of participants and understand the world through their eyes.\n\n---"
