      "content": "The insurance industry is currently undergoing a transformation described by proponents as a \"digital disruption\" and by critics as a fundamental rewriting of the social contract. This transformation centers on the emergence of **behaviour-based insurance (BBI)**, a model that utilizes granular, real-time data from telematics, wearable devices, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to assess risk and price premiums dynamically [cite: 1, 2]. Unlike traditional actuarial models that rely on static proxies (e.g., age, gender, postal code) to pool risk, BBI promises to price risk based on actual individual behavior—how one drives, eats, exercises, or sleeps [cite: 2, 3].\n\nHowever, this technological shift is deeply \"contested\" within the social sciences. It is not merely a technical upgrade but a sociotechnical reorganization that challenges the historical foundations of insurance: the principle of solidarity and the pooling of uncertainty [cite: 4, 5]."

BBI is the primary focus of social scientific critique because it involves deeper surveillance of lifestyle choices."

BBI proponents argue this is the ultimate form of fairness—low-risk individuals should not subsidize high-risk ones [cite: 10, 11].\n*   **Solidarity:** The social function of insurance where risks are pooled to protect the vulnerable. Critics argue that BBI \"demutualizes\" risk, potentially making insurance unaffordable for those who need it most (the sick, the elderly, the poor), thereby dismantling the \"veil of ignorance\" that makes insurance a social good [cite: 12, 13]."

Critics note that this privileges the able-bodied and wealthy, as \"healthy\" behaviors (gym visits, buying healthy food) correlate with socioeconomic status [cite: 9, 20, 26].\n*   **Branding vs. Risk:** Jeanningros and McFall (2020) argue that for Vitality, the behavioral data is less about precise actuarial calculation and more about **branding** and **engagement**. The \"value\" comes from customer loyalty and self-selection (attracting healthy people) rather than predicting the exact moment of death via step counts [cite: 20, 26]."

This challenges the CDS narrative of omnipotent surveillance, showing that insurers are often \"muddling through\" [cite: 22, 27]."

BBI penalizes them for these structural factors, exacerbating inequality [cite: 35].\n*   **Erosion of Solidarity:** If the healthy pay less and the sick pay more, the redistributive function of insurance is lost. This is particularly acute in health and life insurance [cite: 12, 36]."

Whether this results in a \"shared value\" utopia or a \"surveillance\" dystopia depends not on the technology itself, but on the social and political choices made in its regulation and implementation.\n\n---"
