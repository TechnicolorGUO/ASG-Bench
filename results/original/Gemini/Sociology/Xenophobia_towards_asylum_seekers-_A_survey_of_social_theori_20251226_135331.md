# Xenophobia towards Asylum Seekers: A Systematic Survey of Social Theories

**Abstract**
The global escalation of forced displacement has been paralleled by a resurgence of xenophobia directed specifically at asylum seekers. This systematic literature review synthesizes the primary social theories explaining this phenomenon, moving beyond generalized prejudice to examine the specific mechanisms driving hostility toward those seeking international protection. The review categorizes existing scholarship into four dominant theoretical frameworks: Realistic Group Conflict Theory (RGCT) and Welfare Chauvinism; Social Identity Theory (SIT); Integrated Threat Theory (ITT); and Dehumanization. By integrating findings from sociology, political science, social psychology, and neuroscience, this paper elucidates how asylum seekers are constructed as distinct economic, cultural, and security threats. Special attention is given to the "deservingness" heuristic, the neurobiological underpinnings of dehumanization, and the emerging discourse surrounding climate-induced migration. The review identifies critical research gaps regarding the causality of threat perceptions and the efficacy of contact-based interventions in the context of securitized borders.

## 1. Introduction and Background

In recent decades, the figure of the asylum seeker has moved from the periphery to the center of global political discourse. While migration is a historic constant, the specific hostility directed toward asylum seekers—often termed xenophobia or "fear of the stranger"—has become a pressing issue across disciplines [cite: 1, 2]. Unlike voluntary economic migrants, asylum seekers occupy a liminal legal and social space that frequently triggers distinct forms of exclusionary attitudes.

The motivation for this review stems from the observation that causal models explaining xenophobia are often fragmented across disciplinary boundaries. Sociologists may emphasize structural inequalities and capitalist globalization [cite: 2], while psychologists focus on intergroup anxiety and cognitive biases [cite: 3, 4]. Political scientists, conversely, often analyze the strategic mobilization of "welfare chauvinism" by populist actors [cite: 5, 6].

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of these social theories. It draws connections between divergent models to present a comparative introduction to the social aspects of xenophobia. The objective is to understand not just the presence of hostility, but the theoretical mechanisms that transform the asylum seeker into a "threat" or a "non-human" entity in the public imagination.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

### 2.1 Xenophobia vs. Racism
Xenophobia is derived from the Greek *xenos* (stranger) and *phobos* (fear). It is defined as a fear or dislike of anything perceived as foreign or strange [cite: 7]. While closely related to racism, xenophobia is distinct in that it is predicated on the perception of "foreignness" rather than solely on biological or phenotypic markers. It manifests as a conflict between an in-group and an out-group, characterized by suspicion, exclusion, and the fear of losing national identity [cite: 7, 8]. In the context of asylum seekers, xenophobia often operates under the guise of "New Racism," which substitutes biological inferiority with "cultural incompatibility," arguing that certain groups cannot assimilate into the host nation's way of life [cite: 2, 9].

### 2.2 The Asylum Seeker as a Distinct Category
The asylum seeker is legally defined as an individual seeking international protection whose claim has not yet been finally decided. This uncertainty is central to the social theories discussed herein. The ambiguity of their status allows for the proliferation of "false belief accounts," where asylum seekers are framed as "illegals," "queue jumpers," or "bogus" refugees [cite: 10, 11]. This categorization is crucial for theories of *welfare chauvinism*, as it places asylum seekers at the bottom of the "deservingness" hierarchy compared to native citizens or recognized refugees [cite: 12, 13].

### 2.3 Dehumanization
Dehumanization is the psychological process of denying full humanness to others. It is a key concept in explaining extreme xenophobia and policy violence. Theories distinguish between *animalistic dehumanization* (denying human uniqueness, e.g., civility, morality) and *mechanistic dehumanization* (denying human nature, e.g., emotional depth) [cite: 14, 15].

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

### 3.1 Early Foundations: Realistic Group Conflict
The historical trajectory of xenophobia research began with materialist explanations. Realistic Group Conflict Theory (RGCT), developed by Sherif (1966), posits that intergroup hostility arises from competition over scarce resources [cite: 16, 17]. Historically, this explained anti-immigrant sentiment during economic downturns. In the context of asylum seekers, this evolved into theories of labor market competition and the "burden" on state infrastructure [cite: 18, 19].

### 3.2 The Social Identity Turn
In the late 1970s, Tajfel and Turner introduced Social Identity Theory (SIT), shifting the focus from material resources to self-esteem and group categorization. SIT posits that individuals derive self-worth from their group membership. Consequently, prejudice is a mechanism to enhance the in-group's status by derogating the out-group [cite: 20, 21]. This milestone allowed researchers to explain xenophobia that persisted even in the absence of economic competition, framing it as a defense of "national identity" [cite: 22, 23].

### 3.3 Integrated Threat Theory (ITT)
A significant milestone in the 1990s and 2000s was the development of Integrated Threat Theory (later Intergroup Threat Theory) by Stephan and Stephan. This framework synthesized previous models by categorizing threats into four types:
1.  **Realistic Threats:** Danger to physical or economic well-being.
2.  **Symbolic Threats:** Danger to values, culture, and worldview.
3.  **Intergroup Anxiety:** Distress experienced during interaction with out-groups.
4.  **Negative Stereotypes:** Cognitive frameworks that justify threat perception [cite: 3, 4, 24].

ITT has become a dominant framework for analyzing hostility toward asylum seekers, as it accounts for the simultaneous fear of terrorism (realistic/physical), economic drain (realistic/economic), and "Islamization" or cultural erosion (symbolic) [cite: 25, 26].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

Contemporary research has refined these historical theories, employing advanced methodologies ranging from econometric modeling to neuroimaging.

### 4.1 Welfare Chauvinism and the "Deservingness" Heuristic
Welfare chauvinism is the political notion that social benefits should be restricted to the native in-group. Current research utilizes large-scale survey data (e.g., European Social Survey) to model the determinants of this attitude.
*   **The Deservingness Logic:** Recent studies suggest that asylum seekers are viewed as less deserving than other groups because their arrival is often framed as a choice (economic migration) rather than a necessity (fleeing persecution), despite legal realities [cite: 12, 13].
*   **Economic Insecurity:** Research indicates that subjective perceptions of deprivation are stronger predictors of welfare chauvinism than objective economic indicators like GDP. Individuals who fear future economic decline are more likely to support exclusionary welfare policies [cite: 6, 12].

### 4.2 Neuroscience of Dehumanization
One of the most significant methodological advances is the use of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to study xenophobia.
*   **Distinct Neural Pathways:** Research by Bruneau, Kteily, and colleagues has demonstrated that *dehumanization* and *dislike* are processed in different regions of the brain. While "dislike" activates emotional processing areas, dehumanization (viewing others as less evolved) fails to activate the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), an area associated with social cognition and mentalizing [cite: 27, 28, 29].
*   **The "Ascent of Man" Scale:** A state-of-the-art psychometric tool is the "Ascent of Man" scale, where participants rate groups on a visual evolutionary timeline. Studies show that blatant dehumanization (rating asylum seekers as less evolved) is a strong predictor of support for aggressive policies, such as detention and torture, and is distinct from standard prejudice [cite: 14, 30].

### 4.3 False Beliefs and Information Deficits
Current sociological research emphasizes the role of "false belief accounts." This approach measures the correlation between factual inaccuracies (e.g., overestimating the number of asylum seekers or believing they are illegal) and xenophobic attitudes. Studies in Australia have shown that false beliefs are not merely the result of ignorance but are often motivated cognitions linked to right-wing political orientation and prejudice [cite: 10, 11].

## 5. Applications and Case Studies

### 5.1 The European "Refugee Crisis" and Welfare Chauvinism
The influx of asylum seekers into Europe around 2015 provided a critical case study for ITT and Welfare Chauvinism.
*   **Symbolic vs. Realistic Threat:** In countries like Germany and Hungary, the discourse shifted rapidly from humanitarianism to threat. Research indicates that while economic concerns (realistic threat) were present, symbolic threats to national culture and religion were potent drivers of xenophobia [cite: 25, 26].
*   **Political Mobilization:** Right-wing populist parties successfully mobilized welfare chauvinism, framing asylum seekers as "free riders" on the generous European social security systems [cite: 5, 31].

### 5.2 South Africa: Xenophobia or Violent Entrepreneurship?
South Africa presents a unique and violent case study. The term "xenophobia" is frequently used to describe lethal attacks on African migrants, particularly Somali shopkeepers.
*   **Violent Entrepreneurship:** Some scholars argue that "xenophobia" is a misnomer that masks criminal opportunism and economic competition in the informal sector. This application of RGCT suggests that local business owners mobilize community sentiment to eliminate foreign competition [cite: 32].
*   **Social Identity:** Conversely, other analyses using SIT argue that the violence is driven by a "politics of fear" and a fractured post-apartheid identity, where foreign nationals serve as scapegoats for service delivery failures [cite: 20].

### 5.3 Australia: Dehumanization in Policy
Australia’s "Operation Sovereign Borders" serves as a case study in state-sanctioned dehumanization.
*   **Mechanistic Dehumanization:** By referring to asylum seekers as "illegal maritime arrivals" or "detainees" (stripping them of names and narratives), the state facilitates moral disengagement. Research shows that this bureaucratic dehumanization correlates with public acceptance of indefinite detention policies [cite: 10, 33].
*   **False Beliefs:** The prevalence of the "queue jumper" myth in Australian discourse illustrates how false beliefs function to legitimize exclusion [cite: 11].

### 5.4 The United States: The "Ascent of Man" in Politics
During the Trump administration and subsequent election cycles, rhetoric regarding the southern border provided a live application of dehumanization theories.
*   **Blatant Dehumanization:** Studies utilizing the Ascent of Man scale found that supporters of restrictive border policies (e.g., family separation) were significantly more likely to rate undocumented migrants as less evolved than Americans. This demonstrates that dehumanization is not just a historical phenomenon but an active political variable [cite: 14, 30].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

### 6.1 The Causality Dilemma
A persistent challenge in the field is establishing causality between threat perception and xenophobia. Does the perception of an economic threat cause xenophobia (as RGCT suggests), or do xenophobic individuals retrospectively justify their prejudice by claiming an economic threat? Longitudinal studies are rare, and cross-sectional data often fails to disentangle this relationship [cite: 4, 19].

### 6.2 Measurement and Social Desirability
While the "Ascent of Man" scale has revealed that many individuals are willing to blatantly dehumanize, traditional surveys often suffer from social desirability bias. Respondents may underreport xenophobic attitudes to conform to social norms. Implicit Association Tests (IAT) and fMRI offer alternatives, but these are difficult to scale for population-level research [cite: 28, 29].

### 6.3 The "Migrant" vs. "Refugee" Conflation
Theories often struggle to account for the public's inability or refusal to distinguish between "refugees" (who have a legal right to protection) and "economic migrants." This conflation complicates the application of Welfare Chauvinism, as the "deservingness" of a refugee is theoretically higher than that of an economic migrant, yet in practice, xenophobia often targets them indiscriminately [cite: 34, 35].

## 7. Future Research Directions

### 7.1 Climate Migration and Xenophobia
The intersection of climate change and displacement represents the most urgent frontier for future research.
*   **Narrative Framing:** Early research suggests that framing migration as "climate-induced" does not necessarily elicit empathy. Instead, it can trigger "security" narratives and Malthusian fears of resource scarcity, potentially fueling a new wave of "eco-xenophobia" [cite: 36, 37].
*   **Research Gap:** There is a lack of empirical data on how the public perceives the "deservingness" of climate refugees compared to political refugees [cite: 38, 39].

### 7.2 Computational Social Science and Big Data
The use of social media data to analyze xenophobia is a burgeoning field.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Researchers are increasingly using Twitter (X) and other platforms to map the real-time spread of xenophobic narratives. This allows for the analysis of "contagion" effects and the role of algorithmic amplification in spreading false beliefs [cite: 40].
*   **AI and Bias:** Future research must also address how AI tools used in border management may encode xenophobic biases found in their training data [cite: 41].

### 7.3 Re-humanization Interventions
While much research focuses on the causes of xenophobia, there is a critical need for rigorous testing of interventions. Moving beyond the "Contact Hypothesis" (which assumes interaction reduces prejudice), future research is exploring "re-humanization" strategies—interventions designed to specifically restore the perception of agency and moral status to asylum seekers [cite: 42, 43].

## 8. Conclusion

The literature on xenophobia towards asylum seekers reveals a complex interplay of cognitive, economic, and social mechanisms. No single theory provides a total explanation. **Realistic Group Conflict Theory** and **Welfare Chauvinism** explain the economic anxieties of the host population, particularly in times of austerity. **Social Identity Theory** and **Integrated Threat Theory** elucidate the powerful role of cultural anxiety and the defense of the "national self." Finally, theories of **Dehumanization**, supported by emerging neuroscience, account for the moral disengagement that permits severe state violence against asylum seekers.

The synthesis of these theories suggests that xenophobia is not merely an emotional reaction to the "stranger," but a structured social phenomenon sustained by false beliefs, political mobilization, and deep-seated cognitive biases. As the world faces new drivers of displacement, particularly climate change, the theoretical frameworks surveyed here must evolve to address how "security" and "survival" narratives will shape the next generation of intergroup relations.
