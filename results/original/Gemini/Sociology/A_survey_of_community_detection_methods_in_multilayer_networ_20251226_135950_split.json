Community detection—the identification of densely connected groups of nodes—remains a fundamental task in network science, yet it faces unique challenges in the multilayer context due to the heterogeneity and interdependence of layers. This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive examination of community detection methods in multilayer networks. We synthesize foundational concepts, trace the historical transition from monoplex to multiplex methodologies, and critically analyze the current state-of-the-art, including the rapid emergence of Deep Learning (DL) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches. Furthermore, we evaluate benchmarking frameworks, specifically the evolution from the LFR to the mABCD models, and discuss applications in neuroscience, finance, and social media. The paper concludes by identifying critical research gaps, particularly regarding robustness, scalability, and the handling of bipartite multilayer structures.\n\n---"

      "content": "Network science has emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling complex systems across sociology, biology, and computer science [cite: 1, 2]. Traditionally, these systems were represented as single-layer (monoplex) networks, where nodes represent entities and edges represent a single type of relationship. However, real-world systems are rarely this simple; they often involve multiple, distinct types of interactions, time-varying connections, or hierarchical subsystems. To address this, the field has shifted toward **multilayer networks**, which allow for the representation of diverse interactions as separate but interconnected layers [cite: 2, 3].\n\nA central focus of network analysis is **community detection** (or graph clustering), which aims to partition the network into groups of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the network [cite: 1, 4]. While community detection in single-layer networks is a mature field with established algorithms like the Louvain method and spectral clustering, these traditional algorithms often fail to capture the rich, complementary information present in multilayer structures [cite: 1, 3].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the rapid proliferation of multilayer network research and the concurrent explosion of deep learning techniques applied to graph data. Recent surveys have highlighted the \"untapped potential\" of this field, noting that despite significant strides, the area remains underexplored regarding robustness and unified frameworks [cite: 2, 5]. This paper aims to provide a rigorous, academic overview of the field, categorizing methods into direct, indirect, and learning-based approaches, while critically assessing their strengths and limitations.\n\n---"

This is common in social networks where the same users interact on different platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) [cite: 6, 7].\n*   **Temporal Networks:** Often modeled as multilayer networks where each layer represents a snapshot of the system at a specific time \\( t \\), with interlayer edges connecting nodes across consecutive time steps [cite: 8, 9]."

The literature distinguishes between several structural definitions:\n*   **Pillar Communities:** These are communities that extend across all layers. For a group of nodes to form a pillar community, they must belong to the same community assignment in every layer of the network [cite: 7].\n*   **Semi-Pillar Communities:** A more flexible definition where the community structure persists across a subset of \\( k \\) layers (where \\( 2 \\le k < N_L \\)), acknowledging that community membership may evolve or disappear in certain layers [cite: 7].\n*   **Multislice Communities:** A concept popularized by Mucha et al. (2010), where a node \\( i \\) in layer \\( s \\) is treated as a unique node-layer tuple \\( (i, s) \\). This allows a physical node to belong to different communities in different layers, coupled by a parameter that controls the penalty for changing community membership across layers [cite: 10, 11].\n\n---"

This approach respects layer heterogeneity but struggles with aligning communities when node identities are not strictly consistent [cite: 2, 15].\n3.  **Direct Methods:** These are currently considered the most robust for preserving structural integrity.\n    *   **Generalized Modularity:** Extensions of the Louvain algorithm (e.g., GenLouvain) optimize the Mucha et al. objective function directly [cite: 17, 18].\n    *   **Information Theoretic:** The Map Equation has been generalized to multilayer networks (Infomap), minimizing the description length of a random walker moving across layers [cite: 18].\n    *   **Tensor Decomposition:** Representing the network as a tensor allows for the extraction of latent community structures via non-negative tensor factorization, often requiring the number of communities to be known *a priori* [cite: 14, 16]."

Recent models integrate GCNs with modularity optimization or Markov Random Fields (MRF) to perform semi-supervised or unsupervised community detection [cite: 22, 23].\n*   **Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE):** These probabilistic generative models learn low-dimensional embeddings of nodes. The **VGAE-ECF** (Enhanced Community Detection with Structural Information) represents a recent advancement (2024), incorporating community structure information (from Leiden or Louvain) directly into the learning process to improve latent representations [cite: 24].\n*   **Deep Graph Clustering (DMoN):** A significant recent development is the Deep Modularity Network (DMoN). Unlike supervised GCNs, DMoN optimizes a modularity-based objective function in a fully unsupervised manner. Recent robustness studies (2025) indicate that DMoN maintains stronger resilience against adversarial attacks and perturbations compared to supervised counterparts like GCN and GAT [cite: 25].\n*   **Synergistic Approaches:** New frameworks (2024) have demonstrated that integrating traditional algorithms (like Louvain) into GNN architectures (like GAT) significantly boosts performance in downstream tasks such as link prediction, exemplifying the trend toward hybrid models [cite: 26, 27].\n\n---"

While unsupervised methods like DMoN show promise, the general understanding of robustness in multilayer settings is limited [cite: 25, 40].\n2.  **Scalability:** While mABCD improves benchmarking speed, detecting communities in massive real-world multilayer networks (millions of nodes) remains computationally expensive for direct methods like tensor decomposition [cite: 41, 42].\n3.  **Heterogeneity and Bipartite Layers:** Most methods assume homogeneous node sets. Practical scenarios often involve **multilayer bipartite networks** (e.g., user-item interactions across different domains). Existing algorithms for undirected networks are not directly applicable, necessitating new models like the degree-corrected stochastic co-block model [cite: 43].\n4.  **Parameter Sensitivity:** Methods like multislice modularity rely on coupling parameters (\\( \\omega \\)) that significantly influence the resulting partition.
