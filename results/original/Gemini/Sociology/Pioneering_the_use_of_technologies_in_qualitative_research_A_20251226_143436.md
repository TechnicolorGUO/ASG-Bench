# Pioneering the Use of Technologies in Qualitative Research – A Research Review of the Use of Digital Interviews

**Abstract**
The landscape of qualitative research has undergone a profound transformation over the last two decades, shifting from a discipline almost exclusively anchored in face-to-face interaction to one that increasingly embraces digital mediation. This systematic literature review examines the evolution, methodology, and implications of digital interviewing. It traces the historical trajectory from early asynchronous email exchanges to the ubiquity of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and finally to the pioneering frontiers of Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) moderated data collection. The review synthesizes findings from seminal and contemporary studies to evaluate the efficacy, ethical complexity, and epistemological shifts associated with these technologies. While digital interviews offer unprecedented access to geographically dispersed and marginalized populations, they introduce distinct challenges regarding rapport, non-verbal communication, and the digital divide. The paper concludes that digital interviewing is no longer merely a logistical compromise but a distinct methodological sub-field requiring specialized ethical frameworks and technical competencies.

## 1. Introduction

Qualitative research has traditionally held the face-to-face (FtF) interview as the "gold standard" for data collection, prized for its ability to capture the nuances of body language, environmental context, and immediate rapport [cite: 1, 2]. However, the rapid digitization of society, coupled with global disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, has necessitated a paradigm shift. Researchers have been compelled to pioneer the use of technologies to conduct interviews, moving from viewing digital methods as a "second-best" alternative to recognizing them as a robust, standalone methodological approach [cite: 1, 3].

The motivation for this review stems from the explosion of technological tools available to the qualitative researcher. What began as simple text-based email exchanges has evolved into immersive metaverse interactions and AI-driven automated interviewing systems. This review aims to consolidate the fragmented literature on digital interviews, offering a comprehensive analysis of how technology shapes the research relationship and the data generated.

The objectives of this paper are threefold:
1.  To map the historical development of digital interviewing from text-based origins to immersive virtual realities.
2.  To critically evaluate state-of-the-art methods, including mobile ethnography, VR, and AI, assessing their strengths and limitations compared to traditional methods.
3.  To identify ethical and methodological gaps that must be addressed as the field moves toward increasingly automated and immersive data collection.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

To navigate the literature, it is essential to define the core modalities of digital interviewing.

### 2.1 Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Digital Interviews
Digital interviews are generally categorized by their temporal nature.
*   **Synchronous Interviews:** These occur in real-time, mimicking the flow of a traditional conversation. Technologies include telephone interviews and VoIP video conferencing platforms like Skype, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams [cite: 2, 4]. These methods preserve the immediacy of response and allow for real-time probing.
*   **Asynchronous Interviews:** These do not occur in real-time. Participants respond to prompts at their own convenience. This category includes email interviews, mobile ethnography apps (e.g., Indeemo, dscout), and text-based messaging platforms [cite: 5, 6]. Asynchronous methods are characterized by "time-lagged" interactions, allowing for more reflective and curated responses from participants [cite: 5].

### 2.2 Remote vs. Virtual
While often used interchangeably, distinctions exist in the literature. "Remote" typically refers to the physical distance bridged by technology (e.g., a Zoom call). "Virtual" increasingly refers to environments that are synthetically constructed, such as the Metaverse or VR spaces where avatars interact, creating a sense of "presence" despite the lack of physical bodies [cite: 7, 8].

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

The integration of technology into qualitative interviewing has occurred in three distinct waves.

### 3.1 Phase I: The Textual Turn (1990s–2000s)
The earliest digital interviews were text-based. Mann and Stewart (2000) provided seminal work on internet communication, exploring how computer-mediated communication (CMC) could be utilized for qualitative inquiry [cite: 9, 10]. During this period, email interviewing emerged as a novel technique. Opdenakker (2006) and Meho (2006) were pivotal in defining the advantages of asynchronous email interviews, noting their ability to eliminate transcription costs and allow participants to reflect deeply before answering [cite: 11, 12, 13]. However, these early methods were often criticized for the complete loss of social cues and spontaneous reaction [cite: 14].

### 3.2 Phase II: The VoIP Emergence (2010s)
As internet bandwidth improved, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies like Skype became viable. Hanna (2012) and Sedgwick & Spiers (2009) produced foundational studies demonstrating that video conferencing could replicate some visual cues of FtF interviews while significantly reducing travel costs [cite: 15, 16]. During this phase, digital interviews were largely viewed as a logistical solution for reaching geographically dispersed participants or those with mobility issues, yet they were still frequently compared unfavorably to in-person methods regarding rapport building [cite: 2, 17].

### 3.3 Phase III: The Pandemic Pivot and Normalization (2020–Present)
The COVID-19 pandemic served as a catalyst for the mass adoption of digital methods. With physical distancing mandates in place, researchers had no choice but to migrate online. Thunberg and Arnell (2021) conducted a systematic review of this period, noting that the discourse shifted from "feasibility" to "necessity" [cite: 1, 3]. Platforms like Zoom became ubiquitous, and the "digital interview" became the new norm. This period also saw the rapid maturation of mobile ethnography and the experimental use of VR and AI, marking the transition to the current state-of-the-art [cite: 2, 18].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

Contemporary qualitative research now employs a diverse toolkit of digital technologies, each offering unique affordances for data collection.

### 4.1 Video Conferencing (VoIP)
Video interviewing via platforms like Zoom and Teams is currently the dominant mode of digital qualitative research.
*   **Methodological Strengths:** It allows for the observation of upper-body non-verbal cues and facial expressions, bridging the gap between telephone and FtF interviews [cite: 1, 19]. Features such as screen sharing and automatic recording/transcription have streamlined the analytical process [cite: 18].
*   **Rapport:** Contrary to early skepticism, recent studies suggest that rapport can be established effectively online, particularly when participants are in their own comfortable environments (e.g., home), which may balance power dynamics between researcher and researched [cite: 16, 20].

### 4.2 Mobile Ethnography and Asynchronous Video
Mobile ethnography utilizes smartphone apps (e.g., Indeemo, dscout) to capture "in-the-moment" data.
*   **Technique:** Participants use their own devices to record diaries, upload photos/videos, and answer prompts as they go about their daily lives [cite: 21, 22].
*   **Advantage:** This method reduces the "observer effect" (Hawthorne effect) associated with a researcher's physical presence. It captures authentic behaviors and rituals in real-time contexts that a scheduled interview might miss [cite: 23, 24]. It shifts the dynamic from researcher-led to participant-led data generation [cite: 5].

### 4.3 Virtual Reality (VR) and the Metaverse
The frontier of digital interviewing lies in immersive virtual environments.
*   **Avatar-Based Research:** Researchers meet participants as avatars in virtual spaces (e.g., VRChat, RecRoom). Rzeszewski et al. (2024) and Young et al. (2024) have explored "interviewing in the metaverse," finding that VR can induce a strong sense of "presence" and "co-presence" that 2D video calls lack [cite: 7, 8].
*   **The "Proteus Effect":** Participants may disclose more sensitive information when represented by an avatar due to the anonymity and disinhibition effects provided by the virtual environment [cite: 25]. However, technical challenges regarding interface management and the potential for "harassment" in public VR spaces remain [cite: 8].

### 4.4 AI-Moderated Interviews
The integration of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) is emerging as a disruptive force.
*   **Automated Interviewing:** Tools like "MimiTalk" or custom LLM setups can conduct synchronous voice or text interviews at scale, asking follow-up questions based on participant responses [cite: 26, 27].
*   **Scale vs. Depth:** While AI allows for thousands of qualitative interviews to be conducted simultaneously—bridging qualitative richness with quantitative scale—critics argue it lacks the "cognitive empathy" and interpretive nuance of a human researcher [cite: 28, 29].

## 5. Applications and Case Studies

The application of these technologies has proven particularly valuable in specific research contexts.

### 5.1 Sensitive Topics and Vulnerable Populations
Digital interviews have been pioneered in research involving sensitive topics such as health, victimization, and sexuality. The physical separation provided by digital screens can create a "safe distance," allowing participants to discuss traumatic events with greater comfort than they might in a physical room [cite: 1, 19]. For example, studies on victimization found that digital options yielded richer data because participants felt more in control of their environment and could terminate the interaction easily if overwhelmed [cite: 3].

### 5.2 Geographically Dispersed and Hard-to-Reach Groups
Digital methods have democratized access to participants. Researchers can now interview elites, shift workers, or individuals in conflict zones without the logistical and financial burden of travel [cite: 14, 30]. A case study involving nurse educators demonstrated that email interviews allowed busy professionals to participate asynchronously, resulting in high retention rates and reflective data that would have been impossible to capture via scheduled live interviews [cite: 11, 31].

### 5.3 Longitudinal Health Research
Mobile ethnography has been successfully applied in longitudinal health studies. By using apps to track patient experiences over weeks or months, researchers can move beyond the "snapshot" of a single interview to understand the trajectory of an illness or treatment regimen. This method captures the "say-do" gap by allowing participants to show their reality rather than just describe it retrospectively [cite: 24, 32].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

Despite the advancements, the reliance on technology introduces significant methodological and ethical challenges.

### 6.1 The Digital Divide and Exclusion
A persistent critique is that digital interviewing excludes populations with limited access to high-speed internet or digital literacy, such as the elderly or lower socio-economic groups [cite: 1, 33]. While mobile penetration is high, the requirement for stable bandwidth for video calls can skew samples toward more affluent, tech-savvy demographics [cite: 1].

### 6.2 Technical Glitches and Data Quality
Technical difficulties—frozen screens, audio lag, and connection drops—remain the most cited limitation in digital interview literature [cite: 1, 19]. These disruptions can break the flow of conversation, hamper rapport, and result in the loss of critical data. Researchers are often required to have "Plan B" contingencies (e.g., switching to phone) to mitigate these risks [cite: 1].

### 6.3 Loss of Non-Verbal Cues
While video conferencing captures facial expressions, it often misses body language (hands, posture, feet) and environmental context (what is happening off-camera) [cite: 1]. In text-based or email interviews, paralinguistic cues (tone, volume, silence) are entirely absent, requiring researchers to rely solely on the written word, which can lead to misinterpretation of irony or emotion [cite: 12, 34].

### 6.4 Ethical Dilemmas in the Digital Age
*   **Privacy and Surveillance:** Conducting interviews into a participant's home via video creates privacy risks. Researchers may inadvertently witness non-participants (family members) or sensitive domestic situations [cite: 35, 36].
*   **Data Security:** The use of third-party commercial platforms (e.g., Zoom, Otter.ai) raises questions about data ownership, storage, and confidentiality. There is a risk that sensitive interview data could be accessed by platform providers or used to train AI models without explicit participant consent [cite: 37, 38].
*   **AI Ethics:** The use of AI interviewers introduces the "black box" problem. Biases in training data can lead AI to ask leading or culturally insensitive questions. Furthermore, participants may not fully understand they are interacting with a machine, raising issues of informed consent and deception [cite: 28, 39].

## 7. Future Research Directions

The field of digital qualitative research is evolving rapidly. Several avenues for future inquiry are evident.

### 7.1 Hybrid Methodologies
Future research should explore the efficacy of "hybrid" designs that blend synchronous and asynchronous methods. For example, using mobile ethnography for pre-tasking followed by a Zoom interview for deep diving [cite: 5, 6]. Rigorous comparative studies are needed to establish best practices for integrating these modalities without overwhelming participants.

### 7.2 The Ethics of AI and Automation
As AI tools become more capable, urgent research is needed into the ethical frameworks governing their use. Can an AI interviewer truly obtain "informed consent"? How do we manage the "hallucinations" of AI in data analysis? Developing guidelines for "human-in-the-loop" qualitative research is a critical priority [cite: 39, 40].

### 7.3 Methodological Rigor in the Metaverse
As VR becomes more accessible, researchers must establish methodological standards for avatar-based interviewing. Research is needed to understand how different avatar representations (realistic vs. cartoonish) affect participant disclosure and the validity of the data collected [cite: 25, 41].

## 8. Conclusion

The pioneering use of technologies in qualitative research has fundamentally altered the landscape of inquiry. Digital interviews have evolved from a niche, text-based novelty to a sophisticated, multi-modal discipline that challenges the supremacy of the face-to-face encounter.

This review highlights that while digital interviews offer immense benefits in terms of cost-efficiency, reach, and flexibility, they are not a simple replacement for traditional methods. They represent a distinct mode of communication with their own logic, rules, and ethical requirements [cite: 1, 3]. The shift to digital has democratized research access but also erected new barriers regarding the digital divide.

As we look to the future, the integration of AI and VR promises to further blur the lines between the physical and the virtual. The successful qualitative researcher of the future will need to be a "methodological technologist," capable of navigating the technical, ethical, and interpersonal complexities of the digital realm to uncover the human experience.
