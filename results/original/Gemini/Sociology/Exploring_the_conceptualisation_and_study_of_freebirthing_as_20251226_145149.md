# Exploring the Conceptualisation and Study of Freebirthing as a Historical and Social Phenomenon: A Meta-Narrative Review of Diverse Research Traditions

**Key Points**
*   **Definition:** Freebirthing (or intentional unassisted childbirth) is the practice of giving birth without healthcare professionals present, distinct from accidental unassisted birth.
*   **Historical Roots:** The movement traces back to 1950s pioneers like Patricia Carter and Marilyn Moran, who framed birth as a domestic or psychosexual event rather than a medical one.
*   **Motivations:** Research consistently identifies previous birth trauma, a rejection of the biomedical model, and a desire for autonomy as primary drivers.
*   **Current Context:** The practice has gained visibility through social media and was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic; however, it remains controversial due to safety risks and recent investigations into radicalized online communities.
*   **Research Gaps:** There is a significant lack of quantitative safety data due to the clandestine nature of the practice, and a need for more research into the "fetus ejection reflex" and physiological birth outside clinical settings.

## Abstract

**Objective:** This systematic literature review explores the conceptualisation of freebirthing (intentional unassisted childbirth) as a complex historical and social phenomenon. It aims to synthesize diverse research traditions—ranging from midwifery and sociology to law and bioethics—to understand why women in high-income countries choose to birth without medical assistance despite the availability of maternity care.
**Methods:** A meta-narrative approach was utilized to trace the development of freebirth research from 1950s activist literature to contemporary digital ethnographies.
**Results:** The review identifies freebirth not merely as a rejection of medical safety, but as a proactive response to obstetric violence, a reclamation of bodily autonomy, and a pursuit of undisturbed physiological birth. Historical analysis reveals a shift from the "husband-wife" birth philosophies of the mid-20th century to the radicalized, algorithm-driven "birth keeper" movements of the 2020s.
**Conclusion:** Freebirthing represents a critical collision between the technocratic model of birth and the holistic/social model. Future research must bridge the gap between safety surveillance and the human rights of birthing people, focusing on how systemic failures in maternity care drive women toward unassisted birth.

## 1. Introduction and Background

In high-income countries (HICs) where medical maternity care is widely accessible, a small but significant minority of women intentionally choose to give birth without the presence of a midwife, doctor, or registered healthcare professional (HCP). This practice, known as "freebirthing" or "unassisted childbirth" (UC), challenges the dominant biomedical hegemony that views hospital birth as the only safe standard [cite: 1, 2].

While the global reduction in maternal and neonatal mortality has been largely attributed to the medicalization of childbirth and the presence of skilled birth attendants, the freebirth movement highlights a growing fracture in the relationship between childbearing women and the maternity system. The phenomenon is not monolithic; it encompasses a spectrum of motivations ranging from deep spiritual convictions about physiological birth to pragmatic responses to previous obstetric trauma [cite: 3, 4].

### 1.1 Research Motivation
The motivation for this review is threefold. First, the prevalence of freebirth appears to be rising, particularly following the disruption of maternity services during the COVID-19 pandemic, which acted as a catalyst for women seeking alternatives to hospital restrictions [cite: 5, 6]. Second, recent investigative journalism and academic inquiries have highlighted the emergence of radicalized online "birth keeper" communities, raising urgent ethical and safety questions [cite: 3, 7]. Third, despite the risks involved, freebirthing women report profound physiological experiences—such as the "fetus ejection reflex"—that are rarely witnessed or documented in clinical settings, suggesting a gap in obstetrical knowledge regarding undisturbed birth [cite: 8, 9].

### 1.2 Objectives
This paper employs a meta-narrative review framework to:
1.  Define and conceptualize freebirth across different eras and disciplines.
2.  Trace the historical trajectory from 1950s pioneers to modern social media influencers.
3.  Analyze the methodologies used to study this clandestine population.
4.  Synthesize findings regarding motivations, safety, and legal implications.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

To understand the literature, it is essential to distinguish between several overlapping terms used within midwifery, sociology, and law.

### 2.1 Freebirth vs. Accidental Unassisted Birth
**Freebirth** is defined as the *intentional* act of giving birth without a registered healthcare professional present in a country where such care is available [cite: 1, 2]. This distinguishes it from "Born Before Arrival" (BBA), which refers to accidental unassisted births where the mother intended to reach a hospital or have a midwife present but labor progressed too rapidly [cite: 2, 10]. However, the literature notes that some women disguise freebirths as BBAs to avoid social stigma or child protective services (CPS) investigations [cite: 2, 11].

### 2.2 Unassisted Childbirth (UC) vs. Home Birth
**Home Birth** typically implies a planned birth at home attended by a regulated midwife or physician. In contrast, **Unassisted Childbirth (UC)** explicitly rejects this professional oversight. In the literature, UC and freebirth are often used interchangeably, though "freebirth" has taken on a more political, identity-based connotation in recent years [cite: 5, 12].

### 2.3 Wild Pregnancy and High-Risk Refusal
A subset of the freebirth community practices **"Wild Pregnancy,"** which involves declining all antenatal care, including ultrasounds and blood tests, based on the belief that prenatal surveillance is invasive or harmful [cite: 3, 13]. This is distinct from women who engage with antenatal care but refuse specific interventions or hospital admission due to "high-risk" labels (e.g., breech presentation, VBAC, or post-dates), often termed "birthing outside the system" [cite: 11].

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

The conceptualisation of freebirth has evolved significantly over the last century, shifting from a private domestic choice to a public, often polarized, social movement.

### 3.1 The 1950s Pioneers: Domesticity and Privacy
Contrary to the assumption that freebirth is a strictly modern trend, the meta-narrative review traces its intellectual roots to the 1950s in the United States.
*   **Patricia Carter and The League of Liberated Women:** In the 1950s, Patricia Carter founded the "League of Liberated Women." Carter, who birthed her children alone (sometimes after consuming whiskey for relaxation), viewed unassisted birth as a rejection of the "twilight sleep" era of obstetrics, where women were often unconscious during delivery. Her philosophy was one of extreme privacy and self-reliance [cite: 14].
*   **Marilyn Moran and Husband/Wife Childbirth:** In the 1970s and 80s, Marilyn Moran advocated for "husband/wife childbirth." She conceptualized birth as a sexual, intimate event that should be shared exclusively between the couple. Moran argued that the presence of *any* third party—even a midwife—disrupted the "genital gesture" and the psychosexual flow of labor [cite: 15, 16].

### 3.2 The Natural Birth Movement (1970s-1990s)
As the natural birth movement gained traction with figures like Grantly Dick-Read and Michel Odent, a radical wing emerged that viewed even midwifery as a form of unnecessary intervention.
*   **Laura Kaplan Shanley:** A pivotal figure in this era, Shanley authored *Unassisted Childbirth* (1994). She argued that birth is inherently safe and painless if fear is eliminated. Shanley’s work bridged the gap between the earlier pioneers and the modern internet age, framing birth as a spiritual and psychological event rather than a medical one [cite: 17, 18].

### 3.3 The Digital Era and Radicalization (2010s-Present)
The advent of the internet transformed freebirth from a solitary practice into a networked social phenomenon.
*   **Online Communities:** Early forums allowed women to share "birth stories" that countered the dominant medical narrative of pain and danger. These spaces provided "informational continuity" that women felt was lacking in the medical system [cite: 5, 19].
*   **The Free Birth Society (FBS):** Founded in 2017 by Emilee Saldaya and Yolande Norris-Clark, FBS monetized the movement through podcasts and courses. Recent investigative reports (2025) have linked the group to a radical ideology that frames medical professionals as abusers and downplays serious risks (e.g., breech, twins) as "variations of normal." This era is marked by a shift toward "birth keepers"—unregulated lay attendants—and increased polarization [cite: 3, 7].
*   **COVID-19 Impact:** The pandemic was a significant milestone. Fear of infection in hospitals, bans on birth partners, and the suspension of home birth services in the UK and elsewhere drove a measurable increase in women considering and choosing freebirth [cite: 4, 5, 6].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

Researching a clandestine practice requires innovative methodologies. The literature reveals a shift from purely descriptive studies to complex sociological and phenomenological analyses.

### 4.1 Meta-Narrative Review
The meta-narrative approach, utilized notably by McKenzie et al. (2020), is the gold standard for this topic. Unlike a standard systematic review that aggregates data, a meta-narrative review maps how a topic is "conceptualised" across different research traditions (e.g., medicine, sociology, law). This method allows researchers to understand how freebirth is framed differently—as a "risk" in medical journals versus a "right" in legal texts [cite: 1, 2].

### 4.2 Voice Centred Relational Method (VCRM)
To capture the nuance of women's lived experiences, researchers like McKenzie have employed the VCRM. This involves multiple "readings" of interview transcripts, specifically looking for the "I" voice (e.g., "I felt," "I knew"). This method has been used to create "I-poems," which powerfully convey the emotional and psychological state of the birthing woman, revealing themes of agency and resistance that standard thematic analysis might miss [cite: 9, 20, 21].

### 4.3 Netnography
Given that much of the freebirth community exists online, **netnography** (internet ethnography) has become a crucial tool. Researchers analyze forum posts, Instagram captions, and podcast transcripts to understand the "discursive construction" of freebirth. This method is particularly effective for studying the "Free Birth Society" and the transmission of ideology through social media algorithms [cite: 5, 19].

### 4.4 Scoping Reviews
Recent scoping reviews, such as those by Shorey et al. (2023), have been instrumental in mapping the global prevalence of freebirth. These reviews distinguish between freebirth in HICs (as a choice) and unassisted birth in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) (often due to lack of access), though they note that "obstetric violence" is a shared driver in both contexts [cite: 5, 22].

## 5. Applications and Case Studies

The literature identifies several core themes that explain the "why" and "how" of freebirthing.

### 5.1 Motivations: The "Push" and "Pull" Factors
*   **Trauma and Obstetric Violence:** The most consistent finding across all studies is that freebirth is often a reaction to previous birth trauma. Women describe hospital births as experiences of coercion, non-consensual interventions, and dehumanization. Freebirth is thus conceptualized as a "safety" mechanism to protect the self from institutional harm [cite: 3, 4, 10].
*   **Biomedical Mismatch:** Women often feel a "lack of fit" between their holistic worldview and the technocratic medical system. When requests for low-intervention birth (e.g., water birth, movement) are denied, women exit the system entirely [cite: 11].
*   **Autonomy and Control:** For many, the motivation is not just avoiding harm but actively reclaiming the birth experience. This is framed as "taking radical responsibility" or "sovereignty" over one's body [cite: 3].

### 5.2 Physiological Phenomena: The Fetus Ejection Reflex
A unique contribution of freebirth research is the documentation of undisturbed physiological birth. McKenzie’s research highlights the **"Fetus Ejection Reflex" (FER)**, a phenomenon described by Michel Odent but rarely seen in hospitals. Freebirthing women report an involuntary, powerful expulsion of the baby without active pushing, often accompanied by altered states of consciousness. This suggests that standard hospital environments (characterized by interruptions and adrenaline) may inhibit this reflex [cite: 8, 9, 23].

### 5.3 Case Study: The "Free Birth Society" Investigation
A 2025 investigation by *The Guardian* serves as a critical case study of the modern movement's risks. The investigation linked the "Free Birth Society" (FBS) to multiple neonatal deaths. It revealed that the group’s ideology discourages medical help even in emergencies (e.g., breech, meconium). This case highlights the danger of "echo chambers" where lay "birth keepers" provide medical advice without licensure, reframing clear pathologies as "variations of normal" [cite: 3, 24].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

### 6.1 The Data Deficit and Safety
The primary challenge in studying freebirth is the lack of reliable quantitative data. Because many women disguise freebirths as BBAs or do not register the birth immediately, accurate mortality statistics are non-existent in most HICs [cite: 2, 5]. While some small studies suggest higher mortality rates for unassisted births (e.g., in religious communities), these may not apply to the modern, informed freebirther [cite: 2, 12]. However, case reports of preventable deaths (e.g., shoulder dystocia managed without training) underscore the undeniable physical risks [cite: 3, 25].

### 6.2 Legal and Ethical Ambiguity
The legal status of freebirth varies, creating a complex environment for researchers and families:
*   **United Kingdom:** Freebirth is explicitly legal. The Human Rights Act protects a woman's right to decline care. However, women still face referrals to social services if professionals view the choice as a safeguarding risk to the unborn child [cite: 26, 27].
*   **Australia:** While women cannot be prosecuted for birthing their own babies, legislation in states like South Australia makes it a criminal offense for unregistered persons (like doulas) to provide clinical care, driving the practice underground [cite: 28].
*   **United States:** The legal landscape is fragmented. While self-birth is generally not illegal, the involvement of CPS is a significant threat, and "failure to protect" laws can be weaponized against mothers if outcomes are poor [cite: 2, 29].

### 6.3 Stigma and Polarization
Researchers note that freebirthing women are a "stigmatized group," often labeled as "selfish" or "irresponsible" by the media and medical community. This stigma forces the practice underground, preventing open dialogue between women and HCPs that could potentially mitigate risks (e.g., by negotiating a compromise care plan) [cite: 1, 2, 5].

## 7. Future Research Directions

To advance the field, future research must move beyond descriptive studies of motivation.

1.  **Quantitative Surveillance:** Innovative methods are needed to capture accurate data on freebirth outcomes without compromising women's anonymity. This could involve anonymous national surveys or analyzing "BBA" data for patterns indicative of planned freebirth [cite: 5, 11].
2.  **Physiological Research:** The "Fetus Ejection Reflex" and other phenomena of undisturbed birth warrant rigorous study. Understanding the hormonal and environmental conditions that facilitate FER could inform and improve hospital birth practices [cite: 8, 23].
3.  **The Role of Algorithms:** Research is needed into how social media algorithms radicalize pregnant women, pushing them from natural birth interest toward extreme freebirth ideologies [cite: 7, 19].
4.  **Bridging the Gap:** Studies should evaluate models of care that might "re-engage" women considering freebirth. For example, can "high-risk" home birth pathways or continuity-of-care models satisfy the need for autonomy while providing safety nets? [cite: 11, 30].

## 8. Conclusion

Freebirthing is not merely a fringe medical risk; it is a profound social commentary on the state of modern maternity care. The meta-narrative review reveals that freebirth has evolved from the eccentric privacy of 1950s pioneers to a globally networked movement driven by a crisis of trust in obstetric institutions.

The literature presents a dichotomy: on one hand, freebirth is a rational response to obstetric violence and a reclamation of the physiological power of birth. On the other, it presents real dangers when ideological purity supersedes medical safety, as evidenced by the rise of radicalized online communities.

Ultimately, the persistence of freebirth signals a failure of the mainstream system to accommodate women's desire for autonomy and undisturbed birth. Addressing this phenomenon requires not legal prohibition, which drives it underground, but a systemic shift toward respectful, trauma-informed care that integrates safety with the fundamental human right to bodily sovereignty.
