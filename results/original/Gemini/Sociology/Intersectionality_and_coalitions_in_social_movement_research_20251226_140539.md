# Intersectionality and Coalitions in Social Movement Research: A Survey and Outlook

**Abstract**
This systematic literature review examines the convergence of intersectionality theory and social movement scholarship, with a specific focus on coalition building. Originating from Black feminist legal theory, intersectionality has evolved into a critical paradigm for understanding how overlapping systems of power shape collective action. This paper surveys the historical development of the field, distinguishes between structural and political intersectionality, and evaluates state-of-the-art methodological approaches, ranging from ethnographic discourse analysis to novel quantitative techniques like network analysis and multilevel modeling. Through an analysis of diverse case studies—including the Women’s March, Black Lives Matter, and labor movements in the Global South—this review identifies the mechanisms through which intersectional solidarity is constructed or inhibited. The paper concludes by highlighting persistent challenges in quantitative operationalization and offering future research directions regarding digital activism and the decentering of Global North epistemologies.

## 1. Introduction

Social movements are rarely monolithic; they are composed of actors occupying distinct social locations defined by race, class, gender, sexuality, and ability. For decades, social movement scholarship struggled to account for these internal heterogeneities, often treating movements as unitary actors or prioritizing a single axis of oppression. However, the integration of **intersectionality**—the understanding that systems of oppression are interlocking and mutually reinforcing—has fundamentally reshaped the study of contentious politics [cite: 1, 2].

The motivation for this review stems from the increasing necessity to understand how diverse groups form political alliances in an era of fragmented identity politics. As Silke Roth argues, intersectionality matters for all social movements, not merely as a descriptor of identity, but as both an analytic tool and a political strategy for coalition building [cite: 1]. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of how intersectionality is operationalized in social movement research. It explores how "political intersectionality" facilitates or hinders coalitions, how researchers measure these dynamics, and where the field is heading.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

To understand the dynamics of social movements, one must first distinguish between the theoretical dimensions of intersectionality.

### 2.1 Structural vs. Political Intersectionality
Kimberlé Crenshaw’s foundational work distinguishes between **structural intersectionality** and **political intersectionality**.
*   **Structural Intersectionality** refers to the ways in which the location of women of color (and other marginalized groups) at the intersection of race and gender makes their actual experience of domestic violence, rape, and remedial reform qualitatively different from that of white women [cite: 1, 3].
*   **Political Intersectionality** highlights how feminist and antiracist politics have often functioned in tandem to marginalize the interests of women of color. In the context of social movements, this concept describes the paradox where individuals belonging to two political constituencies (e.g., a labor union and a civil rights group) find their specific interests addressed by neither [cite: 3, 4].

### 2.2 Intersectional Solidarity and Coalitions
In social movement research, a **coalition** is not simply an alliance between two distinct organizations. It is also an internal process within a single movement where diverse subgroups negotiate power. **Intersectional solidarity** is defined as an ongoing process of creating ties across social group differences by negotiating power asymmetries, rather than assuming a pre-existing unity [cite: 5, 6]. This requires "intersectional consciousness"—the awareness of movement organizers to differing inequalities and discrepancies of power and privilege within their own ranks [cite: 7, 8].

### 2.3 The Matrix of Domination
Drawing from Patricia Hill Collins, the "matrix of domination" refers to the overall organization of power in a society. Social movements are situated within this matrix; thus, activists do not just fight external oppression but must also navigate the power dynamics (racism, sexism, classism) replicated within their organizations [cite: 9, 10].

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

### 3.1 Roots in Black Feminism (Pre-1989)
While the term "intersectionality" is contemporary, the praxis predates the coinage. Early formulations are found in the 19th-century speeches of Sojourner Truth and Maria Stewart, who articulated the unique position of Black women [cite: 2, 11]. In the 1970s, the **Combahee River Collective** provided a seminal text, explicitly rejecting the separation of race, class, and sexual oppression, arguing that "if Black women were free, it would mean that everyone else would have to be free since our freedom would necessitate the destruction of all the systems of oppression" [cite: 12, 13].

### 3.2 Crenshaw and the Legal Formulation (1989–1991)
Kimberlé Crenshaw formally coined the term in 1989 to critique antidiscrimination law, which treated race and gender as mutually exclusive categories. Her 1991 work, *Mapping the Margins*, applied this to violence against women of color, demonstrating how social movements (feminism and anti-racism) failed to address the specific vulnerabilities of those at the intersection [cite: 13, 14, 15].

### 3.3 Expansion into Social Sciences (2000s–Present)
In the early 2000s, scholars like Strolovitch (*Affirmative Advocacy*) and Hancock began rigorously applying intersectionality to political science and sociology. Strolovitch’s theory of **selective representation** posited that advocacy organizations prioritize the concerns of their most advantaged constituents (e.g., white women in feminist groups, Black men in civil rights groups) over those of intersectionally marginalized members [cite: 4, 16]. Recently, the framework has expanded beyond race/gender to include disability, sexuality, and immigration status, becoming a dominant paradigm for analyzing the "Resistance" movements (e.g., Anti-Trump protests) [cite: 5, 17].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

The operationalization of intersectionality in research presents significant methodological challenges. The field is currently characterized by a tension between the rich, descriptive depth of qualitative work and the struggle to model complexity in quantitative analysis.

### 4.1 Qualitative Approaches
Qualitative methods remain the stronghold of intersectional research.
*   **Ethnography and Interviews:** These methods allow researchers to observe the "doing" of intersectionality—how activists negotiate privilege in real-time. For example, studies of the Catalan feminist movement use interviews to reveal how "intersectional wounds" and affective solidarity shape internal power struggles [cite: 18].
*   **Discourse Analysis:** Researchers analyze movement manifestos and social media content to determine who is represented in the "we" of the movement. This has been particularly effective in studying environmental and disability rights movements in the UK, revealing how intersectional language is often adopted by grassroots groups but ignored by professional NGOs [cite: 11].

### 4.2 Quantitative Innovations
Quantitative intersectionality has historically been criticized for using additive models (e.g., Race + Gender = Outcome) rather than multiplicative ones. A systematic review of quantitative methods from 1989 to 2020 found that the majority of studies still rely on simple regression with interaction terms, which often fails to capture the structural nature of power [cite: 19, 20].

However, state-of-the-art techniques are emerging:
*   **MAIHDA (Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy):** This method models individuals nested within intersectional strata (e.g., Black working-class women), allowing researchers to partition variance and quantify the specific effect of the intersection beyond the sum of its parts [cite: 21].
*   **Network Analysis:** Recent studies have applied network science to map coalitions. For instance, an analysis of the "New Rights Agenda" in Uruguay used network surveys to visualize how feminist, LGBTQ+, and Afro-descendant organizations formed an integrated structure with specific "bridge-builder" organizations [cite: 22]. Similarly, Twitter hashtag analysis (#BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo) uses network co-occurrence to visualize digital coalitions [cite: 16].
*   **Decision Trees (CART/CHAID):** These data-driven methods identify which intersections of identity are most predictive of an outcome (e.g., participation in protests) without imposing a priori assumptions about which categories matter most [cite: 21].

## 5. Applications and Case Studies

### 5.1 The Women’s March and "The Resistance"
The 2017 Women’s March is a primary case study for contemporary intersectional coalitions. While it was the largest single-day protest in US history, it faced immediate criticism for its initial white-centric leadership. Research indicates that while the march successfully mobilized a diverse coalition, "political intersectionality" was difficult to sustain. Participants’ motivations were often siloed; for example, white women were motivated by reproductive rights, while Black participants were significantly more likely to cite racial justice [cite: 17]. However, the march demonstrated that intersectional *leadership* (the co-chairs) could broaden the movement's frame to include immigration and labor rights [cite: 23, 24].

### 5.2 Black Lives Matter (BLM) and Racial Justice
BLM represents a movement where intersectionality is a founding praxis rather than an addition. Founded by Black women (two of whom are queer), the movement explicitly centers those at the margins of Black politics (trans people, women, the undocumented). Research shows that BLM has successfully utilized "intersectional framing" to build coalitions with LGBTQ+ and immigrant rights groups, challenging the "respectability politics" of earlier civil rights eras [cite: 4, 25].

### 5.3 Labor and Class-Based Coalitions
Intersectionality has revitalized labor movement research by highlighting that "labor issues" are simultaneously race and gender issues. Roth’s analysis of the **Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW)** demonstrates how caucuses can serve as "safe spaces" for minority women to articulate specific demands which are then brought to the wider union [cite: 26]. Furthermore, in the context of austerity in Europe, intersectional coalitions have formed between labor unions and feminist groups to protest budget cuts that disproportionately affect women of color in the public sector [cite: 1].

### 5.4 Environmental and Climate Justice
The environmental movement has historically been criticized for a "white, middle-class" preservationist focus. Recent scholarship analyzes how the **Climate Justice** framework employs intersectionality to link environmental degradation with racism and colonialism. However, empirical studies in the UK suggest a disconnect: while grassroots youth climate strikers often employ intersectional discourse, large environmental NGOs remain resistant to integrating race and disability into their core agendas [cite: 11].

### 5.5 Global South and Transnational Perspectives
Moving beyond the US/Europe, research in the Global South offers distinct insights. In Brazil, the **Marcha das Margaridas** (a coalition of rural women workers) introduced "rurality" as a critical intersectional category, challenging urban-centric feminist theories [cite: 27]. In Uruguay, the success of the "New Rights Agenda" (legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage, and marijuana) was attributed to a dense network of intersectional coalitions that allowed organizations to support each other's primary issues without losing their specific identities [cite: 22].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

### 6.1 The Dilemma of "Identity Politics" vs. Solidarity
A persistent challenge is the tension between asserting specific identities and building broad coalitions. Critics argue that intersectionality can lead to fragmentation or an "Oppression Olympics." However, empirical research suggests that *intersectional awareness*—recognizing power differentials—actually strengthens solidarity by preventing the "secondary marginalization" of the most vulnerable members [cite: 8, 28]. The challenge remains in how to operationalize this awareness in mass movements without devolving into paralysis.

### 6.2 Methodological Limitations
Despite advances, quantitative intersectionality remains underdeveloped. Most datasets lack sufficient sample sizes to analyze complex intersections (e.g., "disabled lesbian indigenous women") without losing statistical power. This leads to the "tyranny of the averages," where unique intersectional effects are washed out [cite: 19, 20]. Furthermore, there is a lack of standardized metrics for "intersectional praxis"—how do we measure if an organization is acting intersectionally? [cite: 29].

### 6.3 Co-optation and Neoliberal Dilution
As intersectionality becomes a "buzzword," there is a risk of it being stripped of its radical critique of power. Scholars note that in policy and NGO spaces, intersectionality is often reduced to "diversity and inclusion" (a headcount of identities) rather than a structural critique of capitalism and white supremacy. This "neoliberal intersectionality" obscures the material redistribution required for true justice [cite: 25, 30].

## 7. Future Research Directions

### 7.1 Decentering the Global North
The majority of intersectionality research is rooted in US Black feminism. Future research must explore how intersectionality travels. How does the framework apply in contexts where "race" operates differently (e.g., caste in India, tribal affiliation in Africa)? Research into "rurality" in Latin America [cite: 27] and post-socialist dynamics in Eastern Europe [cite: 31] indicates a rich avenue for comparative intersectional studies.

### 7.2 Digital Intersectionality and Network Science
The role of social media in forming "digital coalitions" is a burgeoning field. Future research should leverage computational social science to analyze how intersectional solidarity is performed online. Does retweeting across difference translate to offline coalition building? Network analysis of hashtag co-occurrence offers a promising method for visualizing these digital alliances [cite: 16, 32].

### 7.3 Refining Quantitative Methodologies
To bridge the qualitative-quantitative divide, researchers are calling for the wider adoption of **MAIHDA** and **structural equation modeling** to test intersectional hypotheses rigorously. Future work should focus on developing datasets that are designed *ex-ante* with intersectionality in mind, ensuring sufficient oversampling of marginalized subgroups [cite: 21, 33].

### 7.4 Policy and Outcomes
While much research focuses on mobilization, less is known about the *outcomes* of intersectional coalitions. Do intersectional movements actually produce better policy outcomes for the most marginalized? Or does the need for broad consensus dilute the demands? Longitudinal studies tracing policy changes (like the Scottish domestic abuse policy case) are needed to answer this [cite: 34].

## 8. Conclusion

Intersectionality has transitioned from a legal theory to an indispensable paradigm in social movement research. It reveals that coalitions are not merely strategic alliances between groups but are sites of struggle where power, privilege, and identity are negotiated. The literature demonstrates that while intersectionality poses challenges—methodological complexity, internal friction, and risk of co-optation—it offers the only viable framework for understanding collective action in a stratified world.

The "state of the art" is moving toward a synthesis of deep qualitative insight and sophisticated quantitative modeling. By embracing complexity, acknowledging the "matrix of domination," and expanding the geographical scope of inquiry, social movement scholars can better understand how activists build power across difference. As Roth concludes, intersectionality is not just an analytic strategy for researchers; it is a political imperative for movements seeking transformative social justice [cite: 1].
