# Contested Technology: A Systematic Literature Review of Social Scientific Perspectives on Behaviour-Based Insurance

**Key Points**
*   **Paradigm Shift:** Behaviour-based insurance (BBI) represents a fundamental shift from traditional risk pooling (solidarity) to individualized risk assessment (personalization) through real-time data monitoring (telematics, wearables).
*   **Theoretical Divide:** The social scientific literature is largely divided into two camps: **Critical Data Studies (CDS)**, which views BBI as a form of "surveillance capitalism" and exploitation; and the **Sociology of Insurance (STS)**, which empirically studies the practical frictions, failures, and limitations of implementing these technologies.
*   **Key Case Studies:** The field is defined by major case studies, notably **Discovery Vitality** (the "Shared Value" model) and the concept of **"Happy Failures"** (where implementation fails to meet actuarial promises but succeeds in marketing or organizational learning).
*   **Ethical Concerns:** Major unresolved issues include the erosion of social solidarity, the creation of "uninsurable" classes through hyper-segmentation, proxy discrimination via algorithms, and the blurring of lines between voluntary incentives and coercive surveillance.

## 1. Introduction and Background

The insurance industry is currently undergoing a transformation described by proponents as a "digital disruption" and by critics as a fundamental rewriting of the social contract. This transformation centers on the emergence of **behaviour-based insurance (BBI)**, a model that utilizes granular, real-time data from telematics, wearable devices, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to assess risk and price premiums dynamically [cite: 1, 2]. Unlike traditional actuarial models that rely on static proxies (e.g., age, gender, postal code) to pool risk, BBI promises to price risk based on actual individual behavior—how one drives, eats, exercises, or sleeps [cite: 2, 3].

However, this technological shift is deeply "contested" within the social sciences. It is not merely a technical upgrade but a sociotechnical reorganization that challenges the historical foundations of insurance: the principle of solidarity and the pooling of uncertainty [cite: 4, 5].

### 1.1 Research Motivation
The motivation for this review stems from the growing tension between the industry's narrative of "personalization" and "fairness" and the social scientific critique of "surveillance" and "discrimination." While insurers frame BBI as a mechanism to reduce information asymmetry and incentivize healthy behaviors (the "win-win" or "shared value" model) [cite: 6, 7], social scientists argue it introduces new forms of inequality, erodes privacy, and commodifies human experience [cite: 8, 9].

### 1.2 Objectives
This paper provides a comprehensive systematic review of the social scientific literature regarding BBI. It aims to:
1.  Synthesize the theoretical frameworks used to analyze BBI, specifically contrasting **Critical Data Studies** and the **Sociology of Insurance**.
2.  Examine the historical trajectory from actuarial to behavioural valuation.
3.  Analyze key case studies, including Discovery Vitality and experimental failures.
4.  Identify the ethical, legal, and social challenges (ELSI) posed by these technologies.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

To understand the literature, one must distinguish between the technological mechanisms and the sociological concepts they invoke.

### 2.1 Behaviour-Based Insurance (BBI) vs. Usage-Based Insurance (UBI)
While often used interchangeably, the literature makes a distinction. **UBI** typically refers to quantifying *usage* (e.g., "Pay-As-You-Drive" based on miles driven). **BBI** goes further to evaluate the *quality* of behavior (e.g., "Pay-How-You-Drive" based on braking, acceleration, and cornering, or "Pay-How-You-Live" based on step counts and heart rate) [cite: 3]. BBI is the primary focus of social scientific critique because it involves deeper surveillance of lifestyle choices.

### 2.2 Actuarial Fairness vs. Social Solidarity
The central normative conflict in the literature is between **actuarial fairness** and **solidarity**.
*   **Actuarial Fairness:** The economic ideal where a premium exactly matches the individual's expected risk. BBI proponents argue this is the ultimate form of fairness—low-risk individuals should not subsidize high-risk ones [cite: 10, 11].
*   **Solidarity:** The social function of insurance where risks are pooled to protect the vulnerable. Critics argue that BBI "demutualizes" risk, potentially making insurance unaffordable for those who need it most (the sick, the elderly, the poor), thereby dismantling the "veil of ignorance" that makes insurance a social good [cite: 12, 13].

### 2.3 Surveillance Capitalism
Drawing on Shoshana Zuboff’s framework, many scholars define BBI as a manifestation of **surveillance capitalism**. In this view, human experience is extracted as raw material for datafication, processed into prediction products, and sold to modify behavior. BBI transforms the insurer from a passive payer of claims into an active agent of behavioral modification [cite: 14, 15, 16].

### 2.4 The "Active Life Partner"
A specific definition emerging from the literature is the insurer as an "active life partner." This concept, championed by firms like Discovery Limited, reframes the insurer not as a financial safety net but as a coach or guardian that uses nudges and incentives to optimize the policyholder's life [cite: 9, 17].

---

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

The literature traces the genealogy of BBI from the "mutuality" of the 19th century to the "segmentation" of the late 20th century, culminating in the "personalization" of the 21st century.

### 3.1 From Class to Individual
Historically, insurance relied on classifying people into broad risk pools based on static variables. Social scientists note that while this was discriminatory (e.g., redlining), it still maintained a degree of pooling. The "digital turn" in insurance represents a move toward **hyper-individualization**, where the goal is to segment risk so precisely that the "pool" effectively disappears [cite: 18, 19].

### 3.2 The Rise of Telematics
The introduction of telematics in car insurance (black boxes) was the first major milestone. Early literature focused on the "panoptic" nature of these devices. However, recent sociological studies have shown that the "revolution" was slower than anticipated due to consumer resistance and technical friction [cite: 11].

### 3.3 The "Shared Value" Milestone
The launch and global expansion of **Discovery Vitality** (South Africa) is cited as the definitive milestone in BBI. By integrating behavioral economics (nudges, rewards) with actuarial science, Vitality created a model where policyholders "earn" their coverage through proven behavior. This model has been exported globally (e.g., AIA Vitality, John Hancock), marking the institutionalization of BBI [cite: 6, 20].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

The social scientific study of BBI is characterized by a methodological split, identified primarily by Tanninen (2020) [cite: 5].

### 4.1 Critical Data Studies (CDS)
This stream is theoretical and normative. It approaches BBI as a dystopian extension of neoliberal governance and surveillance.
*   **Focus:** Power asymmetries, exploitation, and the "dark side" of metric culture.
*   **Key Argument:** BBI is a mechanism of "dataveillance" where users perform unpaid labor (self-tracking) to generate value for insurers, who then use that data to control and exclude them [cite: 5, 15].
*   **Critique:** Tanninen notes that CDS often treats the technology as a "black box" that works perfectly, failing to account for the messy reality of implementation [cite: 21].

### 4.2 Sociology of Insurance (STS/Pragmatic)
This stream is empirical and grounded in Science and Technology Studies (STS). It investigates how BBI is actually *done* in practice.
*   **Focus:** The practices, frictions, and negotiations inside insurance firms.
*   **Key Argument:** The "digital disruption" is not a smooth transition. Insurers face massive challenges in cleaning data, convincing customers, and navigating regulations. The technology often fails to deliver the promised actuarial precision but succeeds as a marketing or customer engagement tool [cite: 4, 22].
*   **Methodology:** Ethnographic interviews with actuaries, analysis of failed experiments, and focus groups with policyholders [cite: 22, 23].

### 4.3 Behavioral Economics in Insurance
While not strictly "social science" in the critical sense, the literature includes the industry's own use of behavioral science methods (e.g., Kahneman’s prospect theory) to design BBI products. This involves using "nudges," loss aversion, and gamification to manipulate policyholder behavior [cite: 10, 24].

---

## 5. Applications and Case Studies

The literature is anchored by specific applications that illustrate the tension between the "imagined" potential of BBI and its "lived" reality.

### 5.1 Discovery Vitality: The "Shared Value" Ecosystem
Discovery Vitality is the most analyzed case study in the field.
*   **The Model:** It operates on a "virtuous cycle" where healthier behavior leads to lower claims, creating value shared between the insurer (profit), the client (rewards/lower premiums), and society (healthier population) [cite: 20, 25].
*   **Social Scientific Critique:** Researchers argue that Vitality functions as a "moral economy" that redefines good citizenship as "healthy citizenship." It creates a system where access to insurance and rewards is contingent on the ability to perform specific, tracked behaviors. Critics note that this privileges the able-bodied and wealthy, as "healthy" behaviors (gym visits, buying healthy food) correlate with socioeconomic status [cite: 9, 20, 26].
*   **Branding vs. Risk:** Jeanningros and McFall (2020) argue that for Vitality, the behavioral data is less about precise actuarial calculation and more about **branding** and **engagement**. The "value" comes from customer loyalty and self-selection (attracting healthy people) rather than predicting the exact moment of death via step counts [cite: 20, 26].

### 5.2 "Happy Failures" in Car Insurance
Meyers and Van Hoyweghen (2020) present a seminal case study of a failed telematics experiment in Belgium.
*   **The Experiment:** An insurer tried to link driving behavior directly to premiums.
*   **The Failure:** The data was messy, the correlation between "braking" and "accidents" was harder to prove than expected, and the logistics were costly.
*   **The "Happy" Outcome:** Despite failing to create a new pricing model, the experiment was deemed a success because it taught the insurer about data governance and customer relationships. This challenges the CDS narrative of omnipotent surveillance, showing that insurers are often "muddling through" [cite: 22, 27].

### 5.3 Corporate Wellness and Workplace Surveillance
In the U.S., BBI often manifests through employer-sponsored wellness programs.
*   **Coercion:** The literature highlights the blurring line between "voluntary" participation and coercion. If non-participation results in higher premiums (or lost discounts), the program is effectively mandatory [cite: 28, 29].
*   **Wellness Capitalism:** This is described as a model where worker behaviors are monitored to reduce corporate costs. It raises significant privacy concerns, as health data flows from wearables to third-party vendors and back to employers, often bypassing HIPAA protections [cite: 30, 31].

### 5.4 Intimate Surveillance
Karen Levy’s work extends BBI into the domestic sphere. She argues that "intimate surveillance" (monitoring children, partners, or elderly parents) is becoming normalized. In the insurance context, this manifests as "networked privacy" issues—where one person's data (e.g., a genetic test or driving log) implicates their family members, creating "privacy dependencies" [cite: 32, 33, 34].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

The review identifies several critical challenges where the technology clashes with social values.

### 6.1 The Problem of the "Uninsurable"
As risk assessment becomes hyper-granular, there is a danger of identifying a class of people who are "uninsurable" because their risk is too high and too predictable.
*   **The Poverty Premium:** Low-income individuals often live in higher-risk environments (higher crime, fewer safe exercise options). BBI penalizes them for these structural factors, exacerbating inequality [cite: 35].
*   **Erosion of Solidarity:** If the healthy pay less and the sick pay more, the redistributive function of insurance is lost. This is particularly acute in health and life insurance [cite: 12, 36].

### 6.2 Discrimination and Proxy Variables
Even if insurers do not explicitly use race or gender, BBI algorithms can discriminate via **proxies**.
*   **Example:** A "safe driving" algorithm might penalize driving at night. Shift workers (who are disproportionately lower-income) drive at night. Thus, the algorithm penalizes poverty under the guise of "behavior" [cite: 37, 38].
*   **Opacity:** The "black box" nature of AI underwriting makes it difficult for regulators to detect this indirect discrimination [cite: 38].

### 6.3 Privacy and the "Datafied Self"
The literature questions the validity of the "notice and consent" model.
*   **Forced Consent:** In a market where BBI becomes the standard, "opting out" may become financially impossible, rendering consent illusory [cite: 39].
*   **Data Ownership:** There is a critique of the asymmetry where users generate data (labor) but insurers own the insights (capital). This is central to the "surveillance capitalism" critique [cite: 15, 16].

### 6.4 The Limits of Behavioral Modification
There is skepticism about whether BBI actually improves health or safety.
*   **The Deadweight Effect:** Incentives often reward people for behavior they were already doing (e.g., giving gym discounts to fitness enthusiasts), rather than changing the behavior of high-risk individuals [cite: 12].
*   **Gaming:** Users may "game" the system (e.g., putting a Fitbit on a dog), leading to data inaccuracies that undermine the actuarial validity [cite: 40].

## 7. Future Research Directions

The review identifies gaps where further social scientific inquiry is needed.

### 7.1 Empirical User Experience
Most critique is theoretical. There is a need for more empirical research on how *insureds* actually experience BBI. Do they feel surveilled? Do they feel cared for? Early focus groups suggest a complex mix of "distributed autonomy" where users negotiate their agency with the device [cite: 23, 39].

### 7.2 The "Not-Yet" Market
Research should focus on the gap between the *hype* of AI insurance and the *reality* of its implementation. The "sociology of the not-yet" suggests studying the failures and delays in BBI adoption to understand the structural resistance of the insurance market [cite: 11, 41].

### 7.3 Regulatory Frameworks
Future research must address how regulations like GDPR or the EU AI Act interact with BBI. Specifically, how can "solidarity" be encoded into algorithms? Can "fairness" be algorithmically defined in a way that prevents proxy discrimination? [cite: 38, 42].

### 7.4 Global South Perspectives
Most literature focuses on the Global North (Europe/US) or South Africa (Discovery). Research is needed on how BBI impacts developing markets where insurance penetration is low and mobile data is the primary infrastructure [cite: 20].

## 8. Conclusion

The literature on behaviour-based insurance reveals a technology that is deeply "contested." It is not merely a tool for better pricing but a mechanism that reconfigures the relationship between the individual, the corporation, and the state.

The **Critical Data Studies** perspective warns of a future defined by "surveillance capitalism," where solidarity is replaced by a punitive focus on individual responsibility and "uninsurability." Conversely, the **Sociology of Insurance** perspective reveals a more nuanced reality: one of "happy failures," where insurers struggle to make the technology work and where the "revolution" is slowed by social and regulatory friction.

Ultimately, the transition to BBI represents a move from **actuarial valuation** (predicting the future based on the past) to **behavioural valuation** (creating the future by modifying the present). Whether this results in a "shared value" utopia or a "surveillance" dystopia depends not on the technology itself, but on the social and political choices made in its regulation and implementation.
