# Tracking US Social Change Over a Half-Century: The General Social Survey at Fifty

**Key Points**
*   **Foundational Resource:** The General Social Survey (GSS) is widely considered the "gold standard" for sociological data in the United States, second only to the U.S. Census in citation frequency for social science research.
*   **Methodological Evolution:** Starting as a face-to-face annual survey in 1972, the GSS has evolved into a biennial, multi-mode (web and in-person) instrument, particularly adapting rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain data continuity.
*   **Key Findings:** Over fifty years, the GSS has documented the "rise of the Nones" (secularization), the complexity of political polarization (often defined as partisan sorting rather than ideological divergence), and fluctuating levels of social trust and institutional confidence.
*   **Challenges:** Like all major surveys, the GSS faces the existential threats of declining response rates and rising costs, necessitating rigorous experiments in mixed-mode data collection to preserve representativeness without sacrificing quality.

## Abstract

**Title:** Tracking US Social Change Over a Half-Century: The General Social Survey at Fifty

Since its inception in 1972, the General Social Survey (GSS) has served as the primary barometer of American social life, providing a cumulative record of the attitudes, behaviors, and attributes of the U.S. adult population. This systematic literature review examines the GSS’s fifty-year trajectory, analyzing its contributions to the understanding of social change, its methodological rigor, and its adaptation to the digital age. The review synthesizes findings across three major substantive domains: political polarization, religious secularization, and social networks. It further critically evaluates the survey's methodological evolution from strict face-to-face probability sampling to complex multi-mode designs necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic and declining response rates. The paper concludes that while the GSS remains an indispensable infrastructure for the social sciences, its future relies on successfully navigating the trade-offs between longitudinal consistency and the exigencies of modern survey research.

## 1. Introduction

The empirical study of society requires robust infrastructure. In the physical sciences, this infrastructure takes the form of particle accelerators or telescopes; in sociology and political science, it takes the form of large-scale, repeated cross-sectional surveys. For the United States, the General Social Survey (GSS) constitutes this critical infrastructure. Conceived in 1971 and first fielded in 1972 by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago, the GSS was designed to fill a void in the national statistical system: the lack of high-quality, accessible, and continuous data on the sentiments and behaviors of the American public [cite: 1, 2].

The motivation behind the GSS was to democratize access to high-quality social science data. Prior to the 1970s, public opinion research was often proprietary or fragmented. The GSS, funded primarily by the National Science Foundation (NSF), was established with a mandate to monitor social trends and provide data immediately to the research community without cost or delay [cite: 3]. Over the last half-century, it has generated a cumulative dataset covering more than two generations and a century of birth cohorts, enabling researchers to disentangle the complex effects of aging, period events, and cohort succession on the American psyche [cite: 4, 5].

This review assesses the GSS at its fifty-year milestone. It explores how the survey has tracked fundamental shifts in American life—from the liberalization of social attitudes to the restructuring of religious affiliation—and examines the methodological innovations required to sustain this project in an era of increasing survey non-response.

## 2. Historical Development and Milestones

### 2.1 Origins and Early Design (1972–1993)
The GSS was created by James A. Davis and colleagues at NORC. The initial design was a "replicating core" model, where a standard set of demographic and attitudinal questions would be repeated to allow for time-series analysis [cite: 1, 6]. From 1972 to 1993, the survey was conducted annually (with exceptions in 1979, 1981, and 1992) using face-to-face interviews. The sample design in the earliest years (1972–1974) utilized block quota sampling, which was subsequently replaced by full probability sampling in 1977 to ensure higher statistical rigor and representativeness [cite: 6, 7].

### 2.2 The Shift to Biennial and International Expansion (1994–2005)
A significant structural change occurred in 1994 when the GSS moved from an annual to a biennial cycle. This shift allowed for larger sample sizes in each round and the inclusion of more extensive topical modules without increasing the annualized cost [cite: 1, 6].

Crucially, the GSS became a global model. In 1984, the GSS co-founded the **International Social Survey Programme (ISSP)**, a cross-national collaboration that now includes over 40 member countries. This expansion allowed researchers to place U.S. trends in a comparative global context, examining whether American exceptionalism holds in areas such as welfare state attitudes, religious belief, and environmental concern [cite: 1, 4, 8].

### 2.3 The Panel Era and Modernization (2006–Present)
While primarily a repeated cross-sectional survey, the GSS has experimented with panel designs. In 2006, a rotating panel design was introduced, allowing a subsample of respondents to be re-interviewed in subsequent waves (2008 and 2010). This design facilitated the study of individual-level change, though the survey largely returned to its cross-sectional roots in later years to prioritize trend monitoring [cite: 6, 7].

The most recent and disruptive historical milestone was the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020/2021 cycle forced a radical departure from the traditional face-to-face methodology, necessitating a rapid pivot to web-based and address-based sampling (ABS) to ensure the safety of interviewers and respondents [cite: 9, 10].

## 3. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

The methodological reputation of the GSS rests on its adherence to rigorous probability sampling and high response rates, historically exceeding 70%—significantly higher than the industry average [cite: 7]. However, the landscape of survey research has necessitated significant evolution.

### 3.1 Sampling and Mode
The GSS target population is English and Spanish-speaking adults (18+) living in U.S. households. The "gold standard" methodology has historically been in-person, face-to-face (FTF) interviewing using Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) since 2002 [cite: 1, 7].

However, the 2022 GSS represents the current state-of-the-art in adaptive design. It employed a **multi-mode experimental design** to bridge the gap between pre-pandemic face-to-face data and pandemic-era web data. Respondents were randomized into two conditions:
1.  **Face-to-Face First:** Traditional in-person recruitment, followed by web options for non-respondents.
2.  **Web-First (Push-to-Web):** Mailed invitations to complete the survey online, followed by in-person follow-up for non-respondents [cite: 9, 11].

This design allows methodologists to disentangle "mode effects" (differences in how people answer based on the medium) from "selection effects" (differences in the types of people who prefer one mode over another) [cite: 12, 13].

### 3.2 Experiments and Psychometrics
The GSS serves as a laboratory for survey methodology. It routinely embeds question-wording experiments to test the stability of attitudes. For example, recent cycles have tested "grid-format" questions versus individual items and the impact of offering explicit "don't know" options in web surveys versus volunteered "don't knows" in face-to-face interviews [cite: 9]. These methodological studies are critical for ensuring that observed social changes are real and not artifacts of measurement error.

## 4. Applications and Case Studies: Tracking Social Change

The GSS has generated over 32,000 scholarly publications [cite: 4, 14]. The literature utilizing this data can be categorized into three dominant themes: political polarization, religious change, and social connectedness.

### 4.1 Political Polarization and Liberalization
A central debate in political sociology concerns whether the American public is becoming ideologically polarized or merely "sorted." GSS data has been instrumental in this analysis.
*   **Liberalization:** Long-term trends show a general liberalization of attitudes regarding race, gender, and civil liberties. Cohort replacement (younger, more liberal generations replacing older ones) drives much of this change [cite: 4].
*   **Sorting vs. Polarization:** Research by Hout, Maggio, and others using GSS data suggests that while Americans' policy views have not necessarily become bimodal (extremist), their partisan identities have become perfectly aligned with their ideologies. In the 1970s, there were many conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans; today, these groups have largely vanished, creating a "sorted" electorate that feels more polarized [cite: 15, 16].
*   **The "Liberal Rebound":** Contrary to the narrative of a permanent conservative shift during the Reagan era, GSS data revealed a "liberal rebound" in public opinion starting in the 1990s, particularly regarding social tolerance and government spending [cite: 4, 17].

### 4.2 The Secularization of America: Rise of the "Nones"
Perhaps the most dramatic trend documented by the GSS is the restructuring of American religion.
*   **The Rise of the Nones:** From 1972 until the early 1990s, the percentage of Americans claiming "no religion" hovered between 5% and 8%. Starting in the 1990s, this number began to climb rapidly, reaching nearly 30% by the 2020s [cite: 18, 19].
*   **Drivers of Change:** Hout and Fischer (2002, 2014) utilized GSS data to argue that this shift was not purely a loss of belief (many "nones" still believe in God) but a political backlash against the Religious Right. As conservative Christianity became linked with right-wing politics, moderates and liberals disaffiliated from organized religion [cite: 4, 20].
*   **Demographic Inertia:** The data shows that this secularization is driven by generational succession. Younger cohorts are entering adulthood with significantly lower rates of affiliation than previous generations, and they are not "returning to the fold" as they age [cite: 19, 21].

### 4.3 Social Networks and the "Isolation" Controversy
The GSS is one of the few sources of egocentric network data (who people talk to about important matters).
*   **The 2004 Controversy:** A widely cited study by McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Brashears (2006) used 2004 GSS data to claim that Americans' social networks had shrunk dramatically, with a tripling of people reporting "no one" to talk to.
*   **Correction and Re-evaluation:** This finding sparked intense scholarly debate. Subsequent analysis, including work by Fischer (2009) and Paik and Sanchagrin (2013), suggested that the 2004 finding was likely an artifact of training effects or interviewer fatigue rather than a sudden societal collapse in sociability. Later GSS waves did not support the catastrophic isolation hypothesis, though they do show a subtle shift toward kin-centric networks [cite: 22, 23, 24, 25]. This episode highlights the importance of the GSS's transparency, allowing the community to audit and correct findings.

## 5. Challenges and Open Problems

Despite its stature, the GSS faces existential challenges common to the survey industry, exacerbated by its specific mandate for long-term comparability.

### 5.1 The Non-Response Crisis
Response rates for face-to-face surveys have declined precipitously. The GSS maintained rates above 70% for decades, but the 2021/2022 cycles saw significant drops (to below 20% for the web-only 2021 wave, though higher for the 2022 mixed-mode) [cite: 7, 26]. Low response rates threaten the validity of the data, raising concerns about **non-response bias**—where those who do not participate differ systematically (e.g., in trust or political engagement) from those who do [cite: 26, 27].

### 5.2 Mode Effects and Comparability
The transition to web-based data collection introduces "mode effects."
*   **Measurement Differences:** People answer differently online than in person. For instance, respondents are more likely to select "don't know" or extreme options when an interviewer is not present to guide them or induce social desirability bias [cite: 9].
*   **Trend Breaks:** The shift in 2021 created a potential "break" in the time series. Researchers must now determine if a change in a variable (e.g., a drop in happiness) is a real social change or simply a result of the change in survey mode [cite: 10, 28].

### 5.3 Cost and Sustainability
Face-to-face interviewing is the most expensive form of data collection. As costs rise and funding remains competitive, the GSS must balance the need for the "gold standard" in-person interview with the cost-efficiencies of web panels [cite: 7, 29].

## 6. Future Research Directions

To remain relevant for the next fifty years, the GSS is undertaking several strategic evolutions.

### 6.1 Hybrid and Multi-Mode Designs
The future of the GSS lies in **mixed-mode designs**. The 2022 experiment demonstrated that a "Web-First" design (mailing invitations to web surveys) is more cost-effective, but a "Face-to-Face First" design still yields higher response rates. Future iterations will likely refine this hybrid approach to optimize the trade-off between cost and coverage [cite: 13, 29].

### 6.2 Integration with Administrative Data
There is a growing movement to link survey data with administrative records (e.g., tax data, mortality records) to reduce respondent burden and increase accuracy. While the GSS has explored this, privacy concerns and consent rates remain hurdles that future research must address [cite: 7].

### 6.3 International Harmonization
The GSS recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the **European Social Survey (ESS)**. This partnership aims to align methodological standards, particularly regarding the transition to self-completion (web) modes. This collaboration will likely lead to more robust cross-national datasets that allow for direct comparison of U.S. and European social trends [cite: 30].

## 7. Conclusion

For fifty years, the General Social Survey has served as the nation's mirror, reflecting the changing complexion of American society. It has documented the liberalization of social norms, the polarization of political identities, and the secularization of religious life. More than just a dataset, the GSS represents a commitment to the idea that social facts should be a public good, accessible to all.

However, the GSS at fifty stands at a crossroads. The "golden age" of high-response, face-to-face survey research has passed. The survey's ability to track the next half-century of social change will depend on its ability to innovate methodologically—embracing digital modes and hybrid designs—while maintaining the rigorous standards of representativeness that established its reputation. As the U.S. faces deepening fragmentation and declining trust, the objective, longitudinal data provided by the GSS is more vital than ever for distinguishing between anecdotal panic and empirical reality.
