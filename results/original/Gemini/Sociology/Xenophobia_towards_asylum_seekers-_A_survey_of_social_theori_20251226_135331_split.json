This systematic literature review synthesizes the primary social theories explaining this phenomenon, moving beyond generalized prejudice to examine the specific mechanisms driving hostility toward those seeking international protection. The review categorizes existing scholarship into four dominant theoretical frameworks: Realistic Group Conflict Theory (RGCT) and Welfare Chauvinism; Social Identity Theory (SIT); Integrated Threat Theory (ITT); and Dehumanization. By integrating findings from sociology, political science, social psychology, and neuroscience, this paper elucidates how asylum seekers are constructed as distinct economic, cultural, and security threats. Special attention is given to the \"deservingness\" heuristic, the neurobiological underpinnings of dehumanization, and the emerging discourse surrounding climate-induced migration. The review identifies critical research gaps regarding the causality of threat perceptions and the efficacy of contact-based interventions in the context of securitized borders.\n\n---"

      "heading": "1. Introduction and Background",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "In recent decades, the figure of the asylum seeker has moved from the periphery to the center of global political discourse. While migration is a historic constant, the specific hostility directed toward asylum seekers—often termed xenophobia or \"fear of the stranger\"—has become a pressing issue across disciplines [cite: 1, 2]. Unlike voluntary economic migrants, asylum seekers occupy a liminal legal and social space that frequently triggers distinct forms of exclusionary attitudes.\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the observation that causal models explaining xenophobia are often fragmented across disciplinary boundaries. Sociologists may emphasize structural inequalities and capitalist globalization [cite: 2], while psychologists focus on intergroup anxiety and cognitive biases [cite: 3, 4]. Political scientists, conversely, often analyze the strategic mobilization of \"welfare chauvinism\" by populist actors [cite: 5, 6].\n\nThis paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of these social theories. It draws connections between divergent models to present a comparative introduction to the social aspects of xenophobia. The objective is to understand not just the presence of hostility, but the theoretical mechanisms that transform the asylum seeker into a \"threat\" or a \"non-human\" entity in the public imagination."

      "level": 3,
      "content": "Xenophobia is derived from the Greek *xenos* (stranger) and *phobos* (fear). It is defined as a fear or dislike of anything perceived as foreign or strange [cite: 7]. While closely related to racism, xenophobia is distinct in that it is predicated on the perception of \"foreignness\" rather than solely on biological or phenotypic markers. It manifests as a conflict between an in-group and an out-group, characterized by suspicion, exclusion, and the fear of losing national identity [cite: 7, 8]. In the context of asylum seekers, xenophobia often operates under the guise of \"New Racism,\" which substitutes biological inferiority with \"cultural incompatibility,\" arguing that certain groups cannot assimilate into the host nation's way of life [cite: 2, 9]."

This uncertainty is central to the social theories discussed herein. The ambiguity of their status allows for the proliferation of \"false belief accounts,\" where asylum seekers are framed as \"illegals,\" \"queue jumpers,\" or \"bogus\" refugees [cite: 10, 11]. This categorization is crucial for theories of *welfare chauvinism*, as it places asylum seekers at the bottom of the \"deservingness\" hierarchy compared to native citizens or recognized refugees [cite: 12, 13]."

Realistic Group Conflict Theory (RGCT), developed by Sherif (1966), posits that intergroup hostility arises from competition over scarce resources [cite: 16, 17]. Historically, this explained anti-immigrant sentiment during economic downturns. In the context of asylum seekers, this evolved into theories of labor market competition and the \"burden\" on state infrastructure [cite: 18, 19]."

      "content": "In the late 1970s, Tajfel and Turner introduced Social Identity Theory (SIT), shifting the focus from material resources to self-esteem and group categorization. SIT posits that individuals derive self-worth from their group membership. Consequently, prejudice is a mechanism to enhance the in-group's status by derogating the out-group [cite: 20, 21]. This milestone allowed researchers to explain xenophobia that persisted even in the absence of economic competition, framing it as a defense of \"national identity\" [cite: 22, 23]."

This framework synthesized previous models by categorizing threats into four types:\n1.  **Realistic Threats:** Danger to physical or economic well-being.\n2.  **Symbolic Threats:** Danger to values, culture, and worldview.\n3.  **Intergroup Anxiety:** Distress experienced during interaction with out-groups.\n4.  **Negative Stereotypes:** Cognitive frameworks that justify threat perception [cite: 3, 4, 24].\n\nITT has become a dominant framework for analyzing hostility toward asylum seekers, as it accounts for the simultaneous fear of terrorism (realistic/physical), economic drain (realistic/economic), and \"Islamization\" or cultural erosion (symbolic) [cite: 25, 26]."

Current research utilizes large-scale survey data (e.g., European Social Survey) to model the determinants of this attitude.\n*   **The Deservingness Logic:** Recent studies suggest that asylum seekers are viewed as less deserving than other groups because their arrival is often framed as a choice (economic migration) rather than a necessity (fleeing persecution), despite legal realities [cite: 12, 13].\n*   **Economic Insecurity:** Research indicates that subjective perceptions of deprivation are stronger predictors of welfare chauvinism than objective economic indicators like GDP. Individuals who fear future economic decline are more likely to support exclusionary welfare policies [cite: 6, 12]."

While \"dislike\" activates emotional processing areas, dehumanization (viewing others as less evolved) fails to activate the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), an area associated with social cognition and mentalizing [cite: 27, 28, 29].\n*   **The \"Ascent of Man\" Scale:** A state-of-the-art psychometric tool is the \"Ascent of Man\" scale, where participants rate groups on a visual evolutionary timeline.

This application of RGCT suggests that local business owners mobilize community sentiment to eliminate foreign competition [cite: 32].\n*   **Social Identity:** Conversely, other analyses using SIT argue that the violence is driven by a \"politics of fear\" and a fractured post-apartheid identity, where foreign nationals serve as scapegoats for service delivery failures [cite: 20]."

No single theory provides a total explanation. **Realistic Group Conflict Theory** and **Welfare Chauvinism** explain the economic anxieties of the host population, particularly in times of austerity. **Social Identity Theory** and **Integrated Threat Theory** elucidate the powerful role of cultural anxiety and the defense of the \"national self.\" Finally, theories of **Dehumanization**, supported by emerging neuroscience, account for the moral disengagement that permits severe state violence against asylum seekers.\n\nThe synthesis of these theories suggests that xenophobia is not merely an emotional reaction to the \"stranger,\" but a structured social phenomenon sustained by false beliefs, political mobilization, and deep-seated cognitive biases. As the world faces new drivers of displacement, particularly climate change, the theoretical frameworks surveyed here must evolve to address how \"security\" and \"survival\" narratives will shape the next generation of intergroup relations."
