      "content": "The statistical mechanics of isolated quantum systems rests fundamentally on the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). ETH posits that for generic non-integrable systems, individual energy eigenstates are locally indistinguishable from a thermal ensemble, allowing the system to relax to thermal equilibrium solely through unitary evolution [cite: 1, 2]. For decades, the primary exception to this rule was Many-Body Localization (MBL), where strong disorder prevents thermalization across the entire spectrum.\n\nHowever, recent experimental and theoretical discoveries have unveiled a new regime of \"weak\" ergodicity breaking. This began with the observation of coherent, long-lived oscillations in a chain of Rydberg atoms, a system expected to be non-integrable and thermalizing [cite: 2, 3]. This phenomenon, termed **Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS)**, involves a small number of non-thermal eigenstates embedded within a dense spectrum of thermal states. Unlike MBL, where all states violate ETH, QMBS constitutes a violation of the strong ETH while potentially satisfying the weak ETH (where most states are thermal).\n\nParallel to this, the concept of **Hilbert Space Fragmentation (HSF)** emerged, describing systems where kinetic constraints fracture the Hilbert space into an exponentially large number of dynamically disconnected sectors [cite: 4, 5]. While QMBS and HSF share phenomenological similarities—such as the failure to thermalize from specific initial states—they represent distinct algebraic structures.\n\nThis review focuses on the \"exact results\" in this field. While early work relied heavily on numerics, the maturation of the field has provided rigorous frameworks—such as the Shiraishi-Mori embedding, commutant algebras, and spectrum-generating algebras—that allow for the analytical construction of Hamiltonians hosting these exotic states [cite: 6, 7]. We further review the most recent developments from 2023-2025, including the application of Fisher zeros [cite: 8, 9] and quantum machine learning [cite: 10] for scar detection."
