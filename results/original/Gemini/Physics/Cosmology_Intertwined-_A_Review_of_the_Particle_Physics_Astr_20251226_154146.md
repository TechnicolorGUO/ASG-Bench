# Cosmology Intertwined: A Review of the Particle Physics, Astrophysics, and Cosmology Associated with the Cosmological Tensions and Anomalies

### Key Points
*   **The Standard Model under Siege:** The $\Lambda$CDM model remains the most successful description of the Universe, yet statistically significant discrepancies—most notably the Hubble Tension ($H_0$) and the Growth Tension ($S_8$)—suggest it may be an approximation of a more complex physical reality.
*   **The Hubble Tension ($H_0$):** A persistent $\sim5\sigma$ discrepancy exists between the expansion rate measured in the local universe (e.g., via Cepheids and Supernovae) and the rate predicted by early universe physics (CMB). Recent data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2024 and 2025 has largely confirmed the accuracy of Hubble Space Telescope measurements, ruling out simple photometric errors as the cause.
*   **The Growth Tension ($S_8$):** Large-scale structure surveys consistently observe a universe that is "smoother" (less clumped) than predicted by Planck CMB data. This tension is currently at the $2\text{--}3\sigma$ level, with recent debates focusing on the role of galactic dust and baryonic feedback.
*   **Intertwined Solutions:** Theoretical attempts to resolve these tensions often face a "cosmic whack-a-mole" problem; solutions that fix the $H_0$ tension (like Early Dark Energy) often exacerbate the $S_8$ tension, suggesting a need for a unified "intertwined" approach to the dark sector.

## Abstract

The standard $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model has provided a robust framework for describing the evolution of the Universe for over two decades. However, as observational precision has improved, significant fissures have emerged. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of "Cosmology Intertwined," a concept highlighting the interconnected nature of current cosmological tensions. We focus primarily on the $5\sigma$ discordance in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) between early- and late-universe probes and the persistent $2\text{--}3\sigma$ tension in the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($S_8$). We synthesize findings from the recent Snowmass 2021 process and subsequent literature through 2025, including pivotal updates from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We critically evaluate proposed solutions arising from particle physics and modified gravity, such as Early Dark Energy (EDE), interacting dark sectors, and curvature anomalies. The review concludes that these tensions likely signal the necessity for new physics beyond the standard model rather than mere systematic errors.

## 1. Introduction

The field of cosmology has transitioned from an era of order-of-magnitude estimates to one of high-precision measurements. The standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM, assumes a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) and Cold Dark Matter (CDM), governed by General Relativity. This model successfully fits a wide array of data, from the temperature anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to the distribution of large-scale structures (LSS) [cite: 1, 2].

However, the "precision cosmology" era has birthed "tension cosmology." The most statistically significant challenge is the Hubble tension: a discrepancy between the value of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the early Universe (assuming $\Lambda$CDM) and the value measured directly in the local Universe [cite: 1, 3]. Simultaneously, a separate tension has arisen regarding the clumpiness of the Universe, quantified by the parameter $S_8$, where weak lensing surveys prefer a lower value than that predicted by the CMB [cite: 4, 5].

These discrepancies are not merely statistical curiosities; they are "intertwined" with fundamental questions in particle physics and astrophysics. They challenge our understanding of the nature of dark energy, the properties of neutrinos, and the validity of General Relativity on cosmic scales [cite: 1, 6]. This review aims to synthesize the current state of these tensions, incorporating the latest observational milestones from 2024 and 2025, and to categorize the theoretical attempts to resolve them.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

To understand the landscape of cosmological tensions, it is necessary to define the primary parameters and observables at the heart of the debate.

### 2.1 The Hubble Constant ($H_0$)
The Hubble constant quantifies the current expansion rate of the Universe.
*   **Early Universe Probes:** $H_0$ is inferred inversely by measuring the sound horizon ($r_s$) at the surface of last scattering via the CMB. This method is model-dependent, relying heavily on $\Lambda$CDM assumptions. The Planck 2018 collaboration reports $H_0 \approx 67.4 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ [cite: 1, 7].
*   **Late Universe Probes:** $H_0$ is measured directly using a "distance ladder." This typically involves geometric parallax, Cepheid variables (or Tip of the Red Giant Branch stars), and Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa). The SH0ES collaboration consistently reports values around $H_0 \approx 73.0 \pm 1.0$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ [cite: 1, 8].

### 2.2 The Clustering Amplitude ($S_8$)
The parameter $S_8$ quantifies the amplitude of matter density fluctuations, defined as:
\[ S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\frac{\Omega_m}{0.3}} \]
where $\sigma_8$ is the root-mean-square fluctuation of density on scales of $8 h^{-1}$ Mpc, and $\Omega_m$ is the matter density parameter.
*   **Tension:** CMB measurements (Planck) predict a higher degree of clustering ($S_8 \approx 0.83$) compared to direct measurements from weak gravitational lensing surveys like KiDS, DES, and HSC, which favor $S_8 \approx 0.76\text{--}0.78$ [cite: 4, 9, 10].

### 2.3 The Sound Horizon ($r_s$)
The comoving sound horizon at the drag epoch ($z_d$) is the distance sound waves could travel in the primordial plasma before baryons and photons decoupled. It serves as a "standard ruler" for calibrating the expansion history. Reducing $r_s$ is a primary theoretical mechanism for increasing the inferred $H_0$ to match local measurements [cite: 11, 12].

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

### 3.1 The Rise of $\Lambda$CDM
Following the discovery of cosmic acceleration in the late 1990s, $\Lambda$CDM became the concordance model. For nearly two decades, data from WMAP and early Planck releases seemed to solidify this paradigm. However, as measurement uncertainties dropped below 2%, cracks began to appear.

### 3.2 The Snowmass 2021 Process
A pivotal moment in categorizing these anomalies was the "Cosmology Intertwined" white paper produced for the Snowmass 2021 process (published 2022). Authored by over 200 scientists, this document formally recognized that the discrepancies were likely not statistical flukes but potential evidence of new physics [cite: 1, 6, 13]. It categorized the tensions into $H_0$, $S_8$, and curvature anomalies, setting the research agenda for the 2020s.

### 3.3 The JWST Era (2023–2025)
The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) marked a critical milestone. A leading hypothesis for the Hubble tension was systematic error in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry of Cepheid variables due to stellar crowding.
*   **2024/2025 Confirmation:** Recent studies by the SH0ES team using JWST have confirmed HST measurements with high fidelity, effectively ruling out photometric systematics as the source of the tension [cite: 14, 15, 16].
*   **Counter-Arguments:** The Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program (CCHP) has utilized JWST to measure the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) and J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) stars, finding values of $H_0$ closer to the CMB prediction ($\sim 69-70$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), keeping the debate regarding the distance ladder calibration alive [cite: 17, 18, 19].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

### 4.1 The Cosmic Distance Ladder
The local determination of $H_0$ relies on a three-rung ladder:
1.  **Geometry:** Parallax measurements (Gaia EDR3) provide absolute distances to nearby anchors.
2.  **Calibrators:** Cepheid variables or TRGB stars transfer this calibration to host galaxies of Type Ia Supernovae.
3.  **Hubble Flow:** Type Ia Supernovae in the Hubble flow provide the redshift-distance relation.
Current state-of-the-art analysis involves "blinded" reviews and reprocessing of archival data to minimize confirmation bias [cite: 1, 8].

### 4.2 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
Planck 2018 remains the gold standard for full-sky CMB data. However, ground-based telescopes like the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and South Pole Telescope (SPT) provide high-resolution independent checks. Interestingly, ACT and SPT data have shown hints of deviations that sometimes support and sometimes conflict with Planck, particularly regarding the "lensing amplitude" ($A_{lens}$) anomaly [cite: 20, 21].

### 4.3 Large Scale Structure (LSS) and Weak Lensing
Surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), and the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) measure cosmic shear—the distortion of background galaxy shapes by foreground matter. These surveys are now reaching statistical precision comparable to the CMB. The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has recently provided precise Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements that constrain the expansion history independent of the CMB [cite: 5, 14].

## 5. Applications and Case Studies: The Tensions

### 5.1 The Hubble Tension ($H_0$)
The discrepancy stands at approximately $5\sigma$ significance.
*   **Planck (Early):** $67.4 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.
*   **SH0ES (Late):** $73.04 \pm 1.04$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ [cite: 7, 8].
*   **Case Study: JWST Cepheid Observations:** In late 2024 and 2025, the SH0ES team utilized JWST to resolve Cepheids in galaxies previously observed by HST. The infrared capabilities of JWST allowed for the separation of Cepheids from crowded backgrounds. The results showed a mean difference of only $\sim 0.03$ mag compared to HST, confirming the higher $H_0$ value and reinforcing the tension [cite: 16, 22].

### 5.2 The Growth Tension ($S_8$)
The $S_8$ tension is less severe ($\sim 2\text{--}3\sigma$) but highly persistent across different observational probes.
*   **Case Study: DESI and Galactic Dust:** A 2025 study utilizing DESI emission-line galaxies highlighted the sensitivity of $S_8$ measurements to galactic dust extinction. Correcting for dust using new maps reduced the tension slightly but did not eliminate the preference for a "smoother" universe ($S_8 \approx 0.76$) compared to the CMB prediction ($S_8 \approx 0.83$) [cite: 5].
*   **Weak Lensing:** Combined analyses (e.g., KiDS-1000 + BOSS) consistently prefer lower $S_8$. This suggests that structure formation in the late universe has been suppressed relative to $\Lambda$CDM predictions, potentially by baryonic feedback or non-standard dark matter properties [cite: 10, 23].

### 5.3 Curvature and $A_{lens}$ Anomalies
Planck data shows a preference for a closed universe ($\Omega_k < 0$) at over $99\%$ confidence when using temperature power spectra alone. This is linked to the $A_{lens}$ anomaly, where the CMB peaks are smoother than expected, mimicking the effect of extra gravitational lensing. While combining Planck with BAO data restores a flat universe, the internal tension within the CMB dataset remains an open issue [cite: 13, 21, 24].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

### 6.1 The "Whack-a-Mole" Problem
A major challenge in resolving these tensions is their "intertwined" nature. Modifications to the model that solve the $H_0$ tension often worsen the $S_8$ tension.
*   **Example:** Early Dark Energy (EDE) models inject energy prior to recombination to reduce the sound horizon ($r_s$) and increase $H_0$. However, this often leads to an increase in the predicted clustering of matter, thereby exacerbating the $S_8$ tension [cite: 25, 26].

### 6.2 Systematics vs. New Physics
Despite JWST's confirmation of Cepheid photometry, the debate over systematics persists. The discrepancy between Cepheid-based and TRGB-based calibrations (the latter often yielding lower $H_0$) suggests that the "astrophysical rung" of the distance ladder is still a source of uncertainty [cite: 18, 19]. Conversely, the persistence of the tension across independent late-universe probes (e.g., Masers, Tully-Fisher, Surface Brightness Fluctuations) strengthens the case for new physics [cite: 3].

### 6.3 Theoretical Fine-Tuning
Many proposed solutions, such as EDE or interacting dark energy, require significant fine-tuning of parameters (e.g., the timing of the EDE injection) to fit the data without violating other constraints like Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) [cite: 12, 27].

## 7. Future Research Directions

### 7.1 Theoretical Solutions
Research is pivoting toward "Intertwined" solutions that address multiple sectors simultaneously:
*   **Early Dark Energy (EDE):** Refined models involving oscillating scalar fields or "New EDE" are being tested to see if they can satisfy $H_0$ without breaking $S_8$ [cite: 12, 28].
*   **Interacting Dark Sector (IDE):** Models where Dark Matter decays into Dark Energy (or Dark Radiation) can suppress structure growth (solving $S_8$) while potentially affecting the expansion rate. Recent RSD (Redshift-Space Distortion) data places strong bounds on these interactions [cite: 10, 29].
*   **Modified Gravity:** Theories like $f(R)$ gravity or those involving a "sign-switching" cosmological constant are being explored to alter the expansion history at late times [cite: 30, 31].

### 7.2 Next-Generation Observatories
*   **Euclid and Roman:** These space telescopes will map the geometry of the dark universe with unprecedented precision, providing definitive measurements of $S_8$ and the equation of state of dark energy ($w$) [cite: 18, 32].
*   **Gravitational Waves:** "Standard Sirens" (neutron star mergers) offer a completely independent measurement of $H_0$, bypassing the cosmic distance ladder entirely. As detector sensitivity improves, this could be the arbiter of the Hubble tension [cite: 3].
*   **CMB-S4:** Next-generation ground-based CMB experiments will measure polarization with sufficient accuracy to test the EDE hypothesis and the $A_{lens}$ anomaly definitively [cite: 33].

## 8. Conclusion

"Cosmology Intertwined" represents a critical juncture in our understanding of the Universe. The persistence of the Hubble tension at $5\sigma$, reinforced by recent JWST observations, alongside the enduring $S_8$ tension, strongly suggests that the $\Lambda$CDM model is incomplete. While systematic errors cannot be entirely ruled out, the convergence of multiple independent probes points toward the necessity of new physics—potentially involving complex dark sectors, early universe phase transitions, or modifications to gravity. The next decade of research, driven by high-precision surveys and novel theoretical frameworks, promises to either mend the cracks in the standard model or shatter it to reveal a more profound physical reality.
