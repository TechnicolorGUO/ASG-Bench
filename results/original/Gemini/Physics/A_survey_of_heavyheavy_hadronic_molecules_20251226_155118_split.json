This review provides a comprehensive systematic analysis of heavy–heavy hadronic molecules, synthesizing theoretical predictions, experimental observations, and methodological advancements. We focus on the seminal survey by Dong, Guo, and Zou (2021) and subsequent literature, examining the application of Heavy Quark Spin Symmetry (HQSS), One-Boson-Exchange (OBE) models, and Lattice QCD to these systems. While the heavy-antiheavy sector (e.g., $X(3872)$) is well-established, the heavy–heavy sector offers a unique testing ground for exotic hadron structure due to the absence of annihilation channels and the presence of distinct heavy diquark dynamics. This paper reviews the predicted spectrum of $DD^*$, $BB^*$, and heavy dibaryon molecules, analyzes the stability of the doubly-bottom $T_{bb}$ state, and identifies key challenges in distinguishing molecular configurations from compact tetraquarks.\n\n---"

      "content": "The conventional quark model, which classifies hadrons into mesons ($q\\bar{q}$) and baryons ($qqq$), has been challenged in the 21st century by the discovery of numerous \"exotic\" states. These states, often referred to as the $XYZ$ particles, do not fit neatly into the traditional multiplets [cite: 1, 2]. Among the proposed interpretations for these exotics, the **hadronic molecule** hypothesis—where two color-singlet hadrons are bound by residual strong forces, analogous to the deuteron—has gained significant traction [cite: 2, 3].\n\nWhile the heavy-antiheavy sector ($Q\\bar{Q}$) has been extensively studied following the discovery of the $X(3872)$ (also known as $\\chi_{c1}(3872)$), the **heavy–heavy** sector ($QQ$) has historically received less attention [cite: 3, 4]. However, heavy–heavy systems are theoretically pristine; unlike $Q\\bar{Q}$ systems, $QQ$ systems cannot annihilate into gluons or light quarks, potentially leading to narrower, more stable states that provide unambiguous signatures of exotic structure [cite: 5, 6]."

Two primary models dominate the literature:\n*   **Hadronic Molecules:** These are loosely bound states of two hadrons (e.g., $D^0 D^{*+}$) mediated by the exchange of light mesons (pions, $\\sigma$, $\\rho$, $\\omega$). They are characterized by large spatial extent (several femtometers) and binding energies small compared to the hadron masses [cite: 1, 12]. The $T_{cc}^+$ is widely considered a prime candidate for a $DD^*$ molecule [cite: 13, 14].\n*   **Compact Tetraquarks:** These states are formed by a tightly bound diquark ($QQ$) and antidiquark ($\\bar{q}\\bar{q}$) interacting via direct gluon exchange. In this picture, the quarks are confined within a single hadronic volume [cite: 1, 12]."

This symmetry, **Heavy Quark Spin Symmetry (HQSS)**, implies that the potential between heavy hadrons is insensitive to the spin orientation of the heavy quarks [cite: 15, 16]. HQSS allows theorists to relate the properties of observed states (like the $T_{cc}$) to predicted partners (like the $T_{bb}$ or spin-excited states) [cite: 17, 18]."

This approach assumes that the short-range dynamics, which are difficult to calculate directly from QCD, can be approximated by the exchange of light vector and scalar mesons. In the low-energy limit, these exchanges manifest as contact potentials (constants) in the effective Lagrangian [cite: 3, 15]. This method was central to the survey by Dong et al., who used the success of the model in the heavy-antiheavy sector to predict the heavy–heavy spectrum [cite: 3, 19].\n\n---"

The interaction is assumed to be saturated by light meson exchanges ($\\sigma, \\rho, \\omega, \\phi$). In the \"constant potential\" approximation, the momentum dependence is integrated out, leaving contact terms regularized by a cutoff parameter $\\Lambda$ [cite: 3, 7].\n*   **Pole Searching:** Bound states correspond to poles in the scattering amplitude $T$ on the physical sheet (real axis below threshold), while virtual states lie on the second Riemann sheet [cite: 3]."
