Despite its deceptive simplicity—comprising only a kinetic hopping term and an on-site interaction term—the model captures the essential physics of phenomena ranging from the Mott metal-insulator transition to high-temperature superconductivity and quantum magnetism. This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive analysis of the computational landscape surrounding the Hubbard model. We trace the historical evolution from early perturbative approximations to modern, numerically exact techniques. We critically evaluate state-of-the-art methods, including Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT), and the emerging frontier of Neural Quantum States (NQS) and quantum simulation. Special attention is given to recent benchmark initiatives, such as the Simons Collaboration on the Many-Electron Problem, which have established consensus on the ground-state properties of the two-dimensional model. We conclude by identifying persistent challenges, particularly the fermionic sign problem and the scaling of entanglement entropy, and outline future research directions in the era of hybrid classical-quantum computing.\n\n---"

      "content": "The study of interacting fermions on a lattice remains one of the central challenges in modern quantum many-body physics. At the heart of this endeavor lies the Hubbard model, a Hamiltonian that models the competition between the kinetic energy of electrons (favoring delocalization) and their Coulomb repulsion (favoring localization). Since its independent proposal in 1963 by John Hubbard, Martin Gutzwiller, and Junjiro Kanamori [cite: 1, 2, 3], the model has transcended its original purpose of describing transition metal ferromagnetism to become the fundamental testing ground for theories of strong correlation.\n\nThe motivation for solving the Hubbard model is twofold. First, it is believed to contain the minimal ingredients necessary to describe the physics of cuprate high-temperature superconductors, specifically the interplay between antiferromagnetism and $d$-wave superconductivity upon doping [cite: 4, 5]. Second, it serves as a rigorous benchmark for computational methods; because the model is analytically intractable in dimensions greater than one, it drives the development of numerical algorithms that are subsequently applied to more complex materials science problems [cite: 6, 7].\n\nThis review aims to synthesize the vast literature on the computational treatment of the Hubbard model. Unlike previous reviews that may focus on a single method, this paper adopts a \"multi-messenger\" perspective, analyzing how complementary techniques—ranging from tensor networks to machine learning—have been combined to resolve longstanding controversies regarding the model's phase diagram [cite: 7]."
