      "content": "Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs) represent a crucial secondary effect in cosmological perturbation theory, where large-amplitude primordial scalar fluctuations source tensor modes at the second order. Unlike primary gravitational waves generated during inflation, SIGWs are sensitive to the detailed thermal history of the universe and the small-scale power spectrum of curvature perturbations. This review provides a systematic examination of the current state of SIGW research, covering the theoretical foundations, recent analytical advancements in resolving gauge dependencies, and the impact of non-Gaussianity and neutrino damping. We critically analyze the implications of recent observational datasets, including the NANOGrav 15-year release and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 runs, which have constrained the parameter space for Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation. Furthermore, we discuss the emergence of third-order perturbation effects that challenge the standard perturbative treatment and outline future research directions for space-based interferometers."

      "content": "The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration marked the beginning of a new era in cosmology and astrophysics. While the current catalog is dominated by astrophysical mergers of compact objects, a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) of primordial origin remains one of the most sought-after observables in modern physics. Among the various production mechanisms, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs) have garnered intense theoretical and observational interest [cite: 1].\n\nSIGWs arise from the non-linear nature of General Relativity (GR). In the standard cosmological model, first-order scalar perturbations (density fluctuations) are coupled to tensor perturbations (gravitational waves) at the second order. If the primordial scalar power spectrum is sufficiently enhanced on small scales—scales significantly smaller than those probed by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)—these fluctuations can induce a detectable background of GWs upon horizon reentry [cite: 2, 3].\n\nThe motivation for studying SIGWs is twofold. First, they serve as a tracer for Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). The formation of PBHs requires large overdensities, which inevitably generate SIGWs; thus, the detection or non-detection of SIGWs provides the most robust constraints on PBH abundance [cite: 4, 5]. Second, SIGWs offer a window into the physics of the early universe, including the equation of state during reheating, neutrino free-streaming effects, and potential deviations from GR [cite: 6, 7, 8].\n\nThis review aims to synthesize the rapid developments in the field from 2021 to 2025. We address the resolution of long-standing theoretical ambiguities regarding gauge dependence, examine the impact of higher-order perturbation theory, and evaluate the latest constraints from ground-based and pulsar timing array experiments."

While scalar and tensor modes decouple at the linear order (first order), they couple at the second order.

      "heading": "3. Historical Development and Milestones",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The theoretical possibility that density perturbations could generate gravitational waves was first identified by Tomita in 1967. However, the field remained relatively dormant until the 1990s, when Matarrese et al. developed the formalism for second-order perturbations [cite: 1, 2].\n\nA significant milestone occurred in 2007 when Ananda, Clarkson, and Wands provided the first full calculation of the GW spectrum induced by a power-law scalar spectrum during radiation domination. This work established that the resulting GW background would be detectable if the scalar amplitude was large enough [cite: 2].\n\nThe field experienced a renaissance following the first direct detection of GWs in 2015. The realization that PBHs could constitute a fraction of Dark Matter (DM) led to a surge in studies linking PBH formation to SIGWs. Between 2018 and 2021, the formalism was refined to include the effects of the thermal history of the universe and gauge dependencies, culminating in the comprehensive review by Domènech (2021) [cite: 1, 11].\n\nRecent years (2023-2025) have seen a shift toward precision cosmology with SIGWs, focusing on higher-order effects (third-order perturbations), non-Gaussianity, and the rigorous treatment of gauge issues [cite: 12, 13, 14]."

      "heading": "4.1. Resolving Gauge Dependence",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "One of the most contentious issues in SIGW literature has been the gauge dependence of the calculated energy density $\\Omega_{GW}$. Since the source term is non-linear, the resulting tensor modes appeared to vary depending on the gauge choice (e.g., synchronous vs. Newtonian/longitudinal gauge) [cite: 13, 15, 16].\n\nRecent analytical studies in 2024 and 2025 have largely resolved this ambiguity. It has been demonstrated that while the tensor perturbations are gauge-dependent on super-horizon scales, the observable energy density converges in the sub-horizon limit ($k\\eta \\gg 1$) where the waves propagate freely as radiation [cite: 13, 15, 17].\n*   **The Dichotomy:** A 2025 study identified a dichotomy across nine different gauges. In gauges like the Uniform Density (UD) and Transverse-Traceless (TT), the energy density can exhibit spurious polynomial growth ($\\eta^n$). In contrast, gauges like the Longitudinal and Newtonian-motion gauges yield a convergent late-time spectrum [cite: 18].\n*   **Resolution:** The consensus method involves a \"kernel projection\" that isolates the luminal, freely propagating components (oscillating as $\\sin(k\\eta)$ and $\\cos(k\\eta)$), thereby eliminating non-physical gauge artifacts [cite: 18]."
