# Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves: A Comprehensive Review of Theory, Phenomenology, and Observational Constraints

**Key Points**
*   **Definition:** Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs) are second-order tensor perturbations generated by the non-linear coupling of first-order scalar (density) fluctuations, offering a unique probe of the early universe on scales inaccessible to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).
*   **Observational Status:** Recent data from Pulsar Timing Arrays (NANOGrav 15-year dataset) and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) have placed stringent constraints on the abundance of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) via the non-detection (or potential detection) of the associated SIGW background.
*   **Theoretical Challenges:** The field faces significant theoretical hurdles, particularly the gauge dependence of SIGWs during formation and the breakdown of perturbation theory at third order when scalar amplitudes are large.
*   **Future Prospects:** Next-generation detectors like LISA and the Einstein Telescope are expected to probe the SIGW spectrum with sufficient sensitivity to distinguish between primordial sources and astrophysical foregrounds, potentially resolving the origin of dark matter if it consists of PBHs.

## Abstract

Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs) represent a crucial secondary effect in cosmological perturbation theory, where large-amplitude primordial scalar fluctuations source tensor modes at the second order. Unlike primary gravitational waves generated during inflation, SIGWs are sensitive to the detailed thermal history of the universe and the small-scale power spectrum of curvature perturbations. This review provides a systematic examination of the current state of SIGW research, covering the theoretical foundations, recent analytical advancements in resolving gauge dependencies, and the impact of non-Gaussianity and neutrino damping. We critically analyze the implications of recent observational datasets, including the NANOGrav 15-year release and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 runs, which have constrained the parameter space for Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation. Furthermore, we discuss the emergence of third-order perturbation effects that challenge the standard perturbative treatment and outline future research directions for space-based interferometers.

## 1. Introduction

The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration marked the beginning of a new era in cosmology and astrophysics. While the current catalog is dominated by astrophysical mergers of compact objects, a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) of primordial origin remains one of the most sought-after observables in modern physics. Among the various production mechanisms, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs) have garnered intense theoretical and observational interest [cite: 1].

SIGWs arise from the non-linear nature of General Relativity (GR). In the standard cosmological model, first-order scalar perturbations (density fluctuations) are coupled to tensor perturbations (gravitational waves) at the second order. If the primordial scalar power spectrum is sufficiently enhanced on small scales—scales significantly smaller than those probed by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)—these fluctuations can induce a detectable background of GWs upon horizon reentry [cite: 2, 3].

The motivation for studying SIGWs is twofold. First, they serve as a tracer for Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). The formation of PBHs requires large overdensities, which inevitably generate SIGWs; thus, the detection or non-detection of SIGWs provides the most robust constraints on PBH abundance [cite: 4, 5]. Second, SIGWs offer a window into the physics of the early universe, including the equation of state during reheating, neutrino free-streaming effects, and potential deviations from GR [cite: 6, 7, 8].

This review aims to synthesize the rapid developments in the field from 2021 to 2025. We address the resolution of long-standing theoretical ambiguities regarding gauge dependence, examine the impact of higher-order perturbation theory, and evaluate the latest constraints from ground-based and pulsar timing array experiments.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

### 2.1. The Source Term
In the context of cosmological perturbation theory, the metric is expanded around a Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background. While scalar and tensor modes decouple at the linear order (first order), they couple at the second order. The equation of motion for the second-order tensor perturbation $h_{ij}$ is governed by a source term $S_{ij}$ composed of quadratic combinations of first-order scalar perturbations $\phi$:
\[
h_{ij}'' + 2\mathcal{H}h_{ij}' - \nabla^2 h_{ij} = -4 S_{ij}^{TT}
\]
where primes denote derivatives with respect to conformal time, $\mathcal{H}$ is the conformal Hubble parameter, and $S_{ij}^{TT}$ is the transverse-traceless projection of the source term derived from the scalar field stress-energy tensor [cite: 1, 9].

### 2.2. The Power Spectrum
The primary observable is the energy density fraction of GWs, $\Omega_{GW}(k, \eta)$, defined as the energy density of GWs per logarithmic wavenumber interval relative to the critical density of the universe. This is related to the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ via a kernel function that encapsulates the transfer of power from scalar to tensor modes during the radiation-dominated (RD) era [cite: 1, 2].

### 2.3. Primordial Black Holes (PBHs)
PBHs are hypothetical black holes formed from the collapse of large density fluctuations in the early universe. The abundance of PBHs, denoted by $f_{PBH}$, is exponentially sensitive to the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum $A_\zeta$. Since SIGWs scale as $A_\zeta^2$, they provide a complementary and often more stringent constraint on $f_{PBH}$ than direct microlensing or evaporation limits [cite: 5, 10].

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

The theoretical possibility that density perturbations could generate gravitational waves was first identified by Tomita in 1967. However, the field remained relatively dormant until the 1990s, when Matarrese et al. developed the formalism for second-order perturbations [cite: 1, 2].

A significant milestone occurred in 2007 when Ananda, Clarkson, and Wands provided the first full calculation of the GW spectrum induced by a power-law scalar spectrum during radiation domination. This work established that the resulting GW background would be detectable if the scalar amplitude was large enough [cite: 2].

The field experienced a renaissance following the first direct detection of GWs in 2015. The realization that PBHs could constitute a fraction of Dark Matter (DM) led to a surge in studies linking PBH formation to SIGWs. Between 2018 and 2021, the formalism was refined to include the effects of the thermal history of the universe and gauge dependencies, culminating in the comprehensive review by Domènech (2021) [cite: 1, 11].

Recent years (2023-2025) have seen a shift toward precision cosmology with SIGWs, focusing on higher-order effects (third-order perturbations), non-Gaussianity, and the rigorous treatment of gauge issues [cite: 12, 13, 14].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

### 4.1. Resolving Gauge Dependence
One of the most contentious issues in SIGW literature has been the gauge dependence of the calculated energy density $\Omega_{GW}$. Since the source term is non-linear, the resulting tensor modes appeared to vary depending on the gauge choice (e.g., synchronous vs. Newtonian/longitudinal gauge) [cite: 13, 15, 16].

Recent analytical studies in 2024 and 2025 have largely resolved this ambiguity. It has been demonstrated that while the tensor perturbations are gauge-dependent on super-horizon scales, the observable energy density converges in the sub-horizon limit ($k\eta \gg 1$) where the waves propagate freely as radiation [cite: 13, 15, 17].
*   **The Dichotomy:** A 2025 study identified a dichotomy across nine different gauges. In gauges like the Uniform Density (UD) and Transverse-Traceless (TT), the energy density can exhibit spurious polynomial growth ($\eta^n$). In contrast, gauges like the Longitudinal and Newtonian-motion gauges yield a convergent late-time spectrum [cite: 18].
*   **Resolution:** The consensus method involves a "kernel projection" that isolates the luminal, freely propagating components (oscillating as $\sin(k\eta)$ and $\cos(k\eta)$), thereby eliminating non-physical gauge artifacts [cite: 18].

### 4.2. Third-Order Perturbations
Standard calculations truncate the perturbation expansion at the second order. However, recent work (2022-2025) suggests that third-order SIGWs—induced by the coupling of first-order scalars with second-order scalars and tensors—can dominate the spectrum if the primordial amplitude $A_\zeta$ exceeds a critical value ($A_* \approx 1.76 \times 10^{-2}$) [cite: 3, 12, 19].
*   **Impact:** Third-order effects extend the cutoff frequency of the GW spectrum from $2f_*$ to $3f_*$ and can increase the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for LISA by approximately 200% in certain frequency bands [cite: 3, 12].
*   **Breakdown of Perturbation Theory:** A critical finding in 2025 is that for sufficiently amplified scalar fields (necessary for significant PBH formation), the third-order spectrum may increase faster than the second-order one, indicating a breakdown of the perturbative expansion and requiring non-perturbative techniques [cite: 14, 20].

### 4.3. Neutrino Damping and Anisotropic Stress
The free-streaming of neutrinos in the early universe introduces an anisotropic stress that acts as a viscosity, damping the amplitude of gravitational waves. Recent analytical solutions to the Boltzmann equation (2022-2024) quantify this effect, showing a significant suppression of the SIGW spectrum in the infrared region ($k \ll k_*$) and a modification of the spectral tilt [cite: 8, 21]. This damping must be accounted for to avoid overestimating the GW signal in the nanoHertz regime relevant for PTAs.

### 4.4. Non-Gaussianity
The statistical nature of the primordial source affects the SIGW spectrum. While Gaussian perturbations are often assumed, local-type non-Gaussianity (parameterized by $f_{NL}$ and $g_{NL}$) significantly alters the spectral shape.
*   **Broadening:** Non-Gaussianity tends to broaden the peak of the SIGW spectrum and enhance the high-frequency tail [cite: 22, 23].
*   **Anisotropies:** Recent analyses (2023-2024) have computed the angular power spectrum of SIGWs, showing that non-Gaussianity induces specific anisotropies that could be distinguished from astrophysical foregrounds [cite: 24, 25, 26].

## 5. Applications and Case Studies

### 5.1. Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) as Dark Matter
The most prominent application of SIGWs is constraining the abundance of PBHs. If PBHs constitute a significant fraction of dark matter, the required primordial power spectrum amplitude ($\mathcal{P}_\zeta \sim 10^{-2}$) would generate a SIGW background detectable by current or future observatories.
*   **LVK Constraints:** Analyses of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 data have yielded null detections of the SIGW background. This rules out PBHs as the dominant dark matter component in the mass range $\sim [10^{-24}, 10^{-19}] M_\odot$ [cite: 4, 5].
*   **Memory Burden Effect:** Recent theoretical work (2024) on black hole evaporation suggests the "memory burden" effect could slow down evaporation, allowing lighter PBHs ($< 10^{-18} M_\odot$) to persist as dark matter. However, SIGW constraints from LVK data challenge this scenario for specific mass windows [cite: 2, 4].

### 5.2. Modified Gravity
SIGWs provide a testing ground for theories beyond General Relativity. In $f(R)$ gravity and scalar-tensor theories, the coupling between scalar and tensor modes is modified.
*   **$f(R)$ Gravity:** Recent studies (2024-2025) show that modified gravity introduces additional anisotropic stress terms and alters the kernel function, leading to observable imprints in the low-frequency part of the SIGW spectrum [cite: 6, 7, 27, 28].
*   **Scalar-Tensor Mixing:** In theories with scalar-tensor mixing, induced GWs can exhibit distinct spectral features, such as the absence of logarithmic resonances found in pure GR SIGWs [cite: 29].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

### 6.1. Interpretation of PTA Data
The NANOGrav 15-year dataset (and EPTA/PPTA/IPTA releases) found strong evidence for a stochastic background consistent with the Hellings-Downs correlation [cite: 30, 31]. While the signal is consistent with Supermassive Black Hole Binaries (SMBHBs), a SIGW interpretation remains a possibility.
*   **The Challenge:** Interpreting the signal as SIGWs from a standard radiation-dominated era requires a large primordial amplitude, which may be in tension with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and CMB constraints on the effective number of relativistic species ($\Delta N_{eff}$) [cite: 32].
*   **New Physics:** Explaining the PTA signal with SIGWs often requires invoking new physics, such as phase transitions, tachyonic instabilities, or non-standard inflationary potentials (e.g., polynomial $\alpha$-attractors) [cite: 32, 33, 34].

### 6.2. Theoretical Divergences
Despite progress, theoretical calculations at higher orders face divergences. The third-order power spectrum can dominate the second-order one in the infrared limit, suggesting that for large amplitudes, the standard perturbative series may not converge [cite: 14, 35]. This necessitates the development of non-perturbative methods, such as lattice simulations or resummed perturbation theory.

### 6.3. Foreground Contamination
Distinguishing SIGWs from astrophysical backgrounds (unresolved binary mergers) is a major observational challenge. While the spectral slope of SIGWs (typically logarithmic or steep in the UV) differs from the power-law behavior of astrophysical sources ($f^{2/3}$ for binaries), precise component separation requires high-sensitivity detectors and accurate waveform modeling [cite: 31].

## 7. Future Research Directions

### 7.1. Next-Generation Detectors
Future observatories will revolutionize the field:
*   **LISA:** The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna will probe the milliHertz band, bridging the gap between PTAs and ground-based detectors. It is expected to measure the SIGW spectrum with high precision, constraining non-Gaussianity parameters ($f_{NL}$) to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ [cite: 3, 36, 37].
*   **Einstein Telescope (ET) & Cosmic Explorer (CE):** These third-generation ground-based detectors will reach sensitivities capable of ruling out PBH dark matter across a much wider mass range ($\sim [10^{-29}, 10^{-16}] M_\odot$) [cite: 4, 5].

### 7.2. Cross-Correlations
A promising avenue is the study of cross-correlations between SIGW anisotropies and CMB temperature/polarization maps. Since both originate from the same primordial scalar perturbations, a non-zero cross-correlation would be a "smoking gun" for the induced nature of the GW background and help break degeneracies with astrophysical sources [cite: 26].

### 7.3. Refined Theoretical Models
Future work must focus on:
*   **Non-perturbative calculations:** Addressing the breakdown of perturbation theory for large $A_\zeta$.
*   **Beyond-RD Cosmologies:** Calculating SIGW spectra in alternative expansion histories (e.g., early matter domination, kination) to break the degeneracy between the primordial power spectrum and the equation of state [cite: 1, 38].

## 8. Conclusion

Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves have evolved from a theoretical curiosity to a cornerstone of early universe cosmology. They represent the most direct link between the physics of inflation, the formation of Primordial Black Holes, and the observable gravitational wave background. The last few years have seen the resolution of fundamental gauge ambiguities and the establishment of robust constraints from LVK and PTA data.

However, the field stands at a crossroads. The potential detection of a background by NANOGrav challenges standard models, while the theoretical breakdown of perturbation theory at high amplitudes demands new mathematical tools. As we approach the era of LISA and the Einstein Telescope, SIGWs promise to either confirm the existence of PBHs and new inflationary physics or place the most stringent limits yet on the violent history of the primordial universe.
