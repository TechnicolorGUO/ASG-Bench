      "content": "**Background:** Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI)—the deliberate destruction of body tissue without suicidal intent—is a pervasive public health concern, particularly among adolescents. While psychosocial models have long dominated the field, recent years have witnessed a surge in neurobiological research. However, findings have often been fragmented, lacking a cohesive structure to integrate static risk factors with dynamic real-time mechanisms.\n**Objective:** This systematic review synthesizes existing literature to advance a temporal framework for understanding the biology of NSSI. We categorize biological evidence into distal traits (predisposing factors), proximal traits (stable biological characteristics of self-injurers), and dynamic states (physiological fluctuations immediately surrounding the act).\n**Methods:** A comprehensive review of literature was conducted, encompassing neuroimaging, psychophysiology, genetics, and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies. Special attention is given to the \"temporal framework\" proposed by Kaess et al. (2021) and recent advancements in digital phenotyping and machine learning.\n**Results:** Evidence suggests that distal biological traits, such as genetic vulnerabilities and altered neurodevelopment due to early life stress, set the stage for NSSI. Proximal traits, including structural and functional brain abnormalities in emotion regulation circuits (e.g., frontolimbic dysregulation) and the endogenous opioid system, characterize individuals who engage in NSSI. Crucially, dynamic biological states—specifically the mechanism of \"pain offset relief\" and autonomic fluctuations—drive the acute reinforcement of the behavior.\n**Conclusion:** The integration of temporal dimensions into biological models of NSSI clarifies the distinction between vulnerability and acute triggering mechanisms. Future research must leverage real-time monitoring and advanced computational modeling to bridge the gap between static biological markers and the momentary urge to self-injure.\n\n---"

      "content": "Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is defined as the direct, deliberate destruction of one’s own body tissue in the absence of suicidal intent [cite: 1, 2, 3]. Common methods include cutting, burning, and hitting, with prevalence rates peaking in adolescence (approximately 17-22%) and remaining significant in clinical populations (up to 50-80%) [cite: 2, 3, 4]. Despite its prevalence and its role as a robust predictor of future suicide attempts [cite: 2, 5], the biological mechanisms underpinning NSSI have historically remained understudied compared to psychosocial factors [cite: 6, 7].\n\nThe field has traditionally relied on cross-sectional studies identifying static correlates of NSSI, such as difficulty in emotion regulation or history of trauma. However, NSSI is inherently a dynamic behavior, often occurring in short bursts in response to acute distress. This discrepancy between static research designs and the dynamic nature of the phenomenon has created a \"knowledge gap\" regarding the neurobiological sequence of events that leads a vulnerable individual to engage in self-injury at a specific moment [cite: 7, 8].\n\nTo address this, recent expert reviews, most notably by Kaess et al. (2021), have proposed a **temporal framework** that distinguishes between biological traits (stable characteristics) and biological states (transient processes) [cite: 4, 7]. This review adopts and expands upon this framework, synthesizing decades of research to provide a comprehensive biological model of NSSI. We aim to clarify how long-term biological risks translate into immediate behavioral action, integrating findings from genetics, neuroimaging, and the emerging fields of digital phenotyping and computational psychiatry."

Early trials of opioid antagonists like naltrexone provided preliminary support for this view [cite: 15, 17]."

However, specific candidate genes remain elusive, with research pointing toward polygenic risk scores involving serotonin and opioid system genes rather than single-gene determinants [cite: 3, 4].\n*   **Early Life Stress and Neurodevelopment:** Childhood maltreatment is a potent distal risk factor. Neurobiologically, this manifests as alterations in the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and threat-processing circuits (e.g., amygdala). These early insults may \"program\" the brain for heightened stress reactivity, lowering the threshold for emotional dysregulation later in life [cite: 4, 18, 19]."

These regions are critical for top-down emotion regulation and impulse control.\n    *   *Functional Connectivity:* Resting-state fMRI reveals disrupted connectivity between the Default Mode Network (DMN) and the Salience Network, as well as frontolimbic disconnectivity [cite: 9, 10]. Specifically, blunted connectivity between the amygdala and PFC suggests a failure of regulatory regions to dampen emotional reactivity [cite: 1, 9].\n    *   *Pain Processing:* Individuals with NSSI often exhibit higher pain thresholds and tolerance (hypoalgesia) as a trait [cite: 14, 22]. Neuroimaging shows altered activation in the insula and somatosensory cortices during pain processing, suggesting a decoupling of the sensory and affective components of pain [cite: 19, 23].\n\n*   **The Endogenous Opioid System (EOS):**\n    *   Basal levels of endogenous opioids (e.g., $\\beta$-endorphin, met-enkephalin) are often dysregulated in NSSI populations. Some studies suggest lower baseline levels of opioids, driving a \"deficiency\" state that the individual attempts to correct via self-injury (which releases opioids) [cite: 15, 22]. Conversely, chronic engagement in NSSI may lead to receptor downregulation, necessitating more severe injury to achieve relief (tolerance) [cite: 16]."

The act of injury reduces this arousal, providing negative reinforcement [cite: 1, 8].\n    *   *Hypoarousal/Dissociation:* A competing or complementary view suggests that some individuals self-injure to terminate a state of dissociation or numbness (hypoarousal), effectively \"feeling something\" to verify existence. Evidence shows that dissociation during NSSI is associated with less perceived pain [cite: 24].\n\n*   **Pain Offset Relief Mechanism:**\n    *   Experimental paradigms demonstrate that the *cessation* of physical pain elicits a robust positive affective response—relief—that is quantitatively distinct from baseline [cite: 12, 13].\n    *   In individuals with NSSI, this relief response may be heightened or more heavily relied upon for affect regulation. The \"pain offset\" theory posits that the therapeutic effect of NSSI is not the pain itself, but the immediate neurobiological release (likely opioid-mediated) that occurs when the pain stops [cite: 13, 14, 25].\n    *   Franklin et al. (2013) demonstrated that pain offset simultaneously reduces negative affect and increases positive affect, a dual-reinforcement mechanism that makes NSSI highly addictive [cite: 13, 26]."

By distinguishing between the stable vulnerability to NSSI and the transient state of the urge, clinicians and researchers can develop more targeted interventions, moving from general risk management to precise, real-time prevention.\n\n---"
