# Standardizing Synthesis: A Systematic Literature Review of PRISMA-EcoEvo in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology

### Key Points
*   **The "Replication Crisis" in Ecology:** Like psychology and medicine, ecology faces challenges with reproducibility. Meta-analyses, intended to be the gold standard of evidence, have historically suffered from poor reporting and methodological opacity, sometimes described as "wolves in sheep's clothing" [cite: 1, 2].
*   **PRISMA-EcoEvo Solution:** Published in 2021 by O'Dea et al., the PRISMA-EcoEvo extension adapts the medical PRISMA 2020 guidelines to the specific needs of ecology and evolutionary biology, addressing unique challenges like phylogenetic non-independence and complex data structures [cite: 3, 4].
*   **Adherence Gaps:** While reporting quality (stating what was done) has improved, execution quality (doing it correctly) remains inconsistent. Recent evaluations show that many meta-analyses still fail to account for non-independence or properly weight effect sizes [cite: 5, 6, 7].
*   **Competing vs. Complementary Frameworks:** PRISMA-EcoEvo exists alongside ROSES (RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses). While ROSES is tailored for environmental management and conservation policy, PRISMA-EcoEvo is optimized for hypothesis-driven evolutionary and ecological research [cite: 8, 9].
*   **Future Outlook:** The integration of AI tools for data extraction and the push for mandatory journal checklists are emerging as critical pathways to universalize these standards [cite: 10, 11].

## Abstract

**Title:** Standardizing Synthesis: A Comprehensive Review of the PRISMA-EcoEvo Extension in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology

**Abstract:**
The exponential growth of primary literature in ecology and evolutionary biology has necessitated robust methods for evidence synthesis. While meta-analyses offer powerful tools for resolving disputes and identifying general patterns, their reliability is contingent upon transparent reporting and rigorous execution. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review of "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology" (PRISMA-EcoEvo), a guideline extension published in 2021. We trace the historical trajectory of evidence synthesis from medical origins to ecological applications, analyzing the specific methodological deficits that necessitated the EcoEvo extension. We critically evaluate the current state of the field, highlighting the disparity between reporting quality and execution quality as identified in recent meta-evaluations. Furthermore, we compare PRISMA-EcoEvo with alternative frameworks such as ROSES, discuss applications in sub-disciplines like invasion biology and sexual selection, and identify emerging challenges related to automation and artificial intelligence. We conclude that while PRISMA-EcoEvo has established a necessary benchmark for transparency, widespread community adoption and enforcement by journals are required to mitigate the prevalence of low-quality syntheses.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Motivation
In the last three decades, ecology and evolutionary biology have seen a paradigm shift from narrative reviews to quantitative syntheses. Meta-analyses have become the primary vehicle for aggregating research to understand complex phenomena, such as the impacts of climate change or the strength of sexual selection [cite: 5, 12]. However, the authority of these syntheses relies heavily on the assumption that they are conducted objectively and reported transparently.

A critical body of literature has emerged warning that meta-analyses can be "wolves in sheep's clothing"—subjective interpretations hidden under a veneer of statistical objectivity [cite: 1, 2, 13]. Without rigorous reporting standards, readers cannot distinguish between a robust synthesis and one plagued by publication bias, p-hacking, or methodological flaws. Historically, ecology has lagged behind medical sciences in adopting standardized reporting protocols, leading to a proliferation of non-reproducible syntheses [cite: 3, 6].

### 1.2 Objectives
The publication of the PRISMA-EcoEvo extension by O'Dea et al. (2021) marked a milestone in addressing these deficiencies [cite: 4]. This review aims to:
1.  Synthesize the theoretical and practical components of the PRISMA-EcoEvo guidelines.
2.  Evaluate the historical context and the specific ecological challenges that drove its development.
3.  Assess the current levels of adherence to these guidelines and the quality of meta-analytic execution in the field.
4.  Identify research gaps and future directions, particularly regarding the intersection of reporting standards and emerging technologies like AI.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

To understand the significance of PRISMA-EcoEvo, one must distinguish between several overlapping concepts in evidence synthesis.

### 2.1 Systematic Review vs. Meta-Analysis
While often used interchangeably, these terms denote distinct processes. A **systematic review** uses structured, transparent, and reproducible methods to collate evidence to answer a specific question [cite: 3, 14]. A **meta-analysis** is the statistical procedure used to integrate the results of the included studies (effect sizes) to estimate a mean effect and its heterogeneity [cite: 6, 12]. PRISMA-EcoEvo applies to systematic reviews that contain meta-analyses, though its checklist items are relevant to both [cite: 2].

### 2.2 Reporting Quality vs. Execution Quality
A crucial distinction in the literature is between *reporting quality* and *execution quality*.
*   **Reporting Quality:** Refers to the completeness of the description of the methodology. It asks, "Did the authors state clearly what they did?" (e.g., stating that they searched Google Scholar).
*   **Execution Quality:** Refers to the methodological rigor of the steps taken. It asks, "Did the authors do the right thing?" (e.g., weighting effect sizes by inverse variance) [cite: 5, 6, 15].
High reporting quality is a prerequisite for assessing execution quality, but it does not guarantee it. A study can transparently report a flawed method.

### 2.3 The "Wolves in Sheep's Clothing" Metaphor
This metaphor, recurrent in the literature surrounding PRISMA-EcoEvo, describes meta-analyses that appear objective due to their quantitative nature but are actually biased due to subjective decisions made during literature search, inclusion, or analysis [cite: 1, 2, 16]. The PRISMA-EcoEvo extension aims to strip away this disguise by forcing transparency.

---

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

### 3.1 Origins in Medicine (PRISMA 2009/2020)
The standardization of systematic reviews began in medicine with the QUOROM statement, which evolved into the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement in 2009, updated in 2020 [cite: 8, 14]. These guidelines were designed primarily for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating healthcare interventions.

### 3.2 The Ecological Lag
Ecology and evolutionary biology adopted meta-analysis later than medicine. Early reviews of ecological meta-analyses (e.g., Gates 2002) found that techniques standard in medicine, such as assessing publication bias, were rarely used in ecology [cite: 13]. By the 2010s, it became apparent that medical guidelines were not entirely transferable. Ecological data is often observational rather than experimental, involves multi-species comparisons, and deals with complex non-independence issues (e.g., phylogeny, spatial autocorrelation) that are less prevalent in clinical trials [cite: 7, 17].

### 3.3 Precursors to EcoEvo
Before the formal PRISMA extension, researchers attempted to create field-specific checklists. Koricheva and Gurevitch (2014) developed a checklist of quality criteria, and the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE) developed standards for environmental management [cite: 18]. However, a unified, widely recognized standard for general ecology and evolution was missing until 2021.

### 3.4 The Launch of PRISMA-EcoEvo (2021)
O'Dea et al. (2021) unveiled PRISMA-EcoEvo to bridge this gap. It was developed through a survey of 208 researchers and a detailed evaluation of 102 published papers [cite: 3, 14]. The survey revealed that reporting quality was "far below optimal" and that the community perceived the quality to be higher than it actually was [cite: 3, 16].

---

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art: The PRISMA-EcoEvo Framework

The PRISMA-EcoEvo extension is not a rigid rulebook for conducting research but a checklist for *reporting* it. It consists of 27 main items designed to ensure reproducibility [cite: 2, 4, 19].

### 4.1 The Checklist Structure
The checklist covers the standard sections of a manuscript (Title, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion). However, it introduces modifications specific to the field:
*   **Taxonomic and Geographic Scope:** Explicit reporting of the target population is critical in ecology, where results may vary by biome or clade [cite: 17].
*   **Phylogenetic Non-independence:** Unlike medical patients, species in an ecological meta-analysis share an evolutionary history. PRISMA-EcoEvo requires authors to report how they controlled for phylogenetic relatedness [cite: 5, 6].
*   **Complex Data Structures:** Ecological studies often yield multiple effect sizes per study (e.g., multiple time points, multiple response variables). The guidelines require transparency on how these dependencies were handled [cite: 7].

### 4.2 Comparison with ROSES
A significant methodological alternative is ROSES (RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses).
*   **Target Audience:** ROSES is tailored for *environmental management* and conservation policy, often prioritizing "systematic maps" and stakeholder engagement [cite: 8, 9].
*   **PRISMA-EcoEvo Focus:** This framework is more aligned with *hypothesis-driven* research in evolutionary biology and basic ecology [cite: 20, 21].
*   **Key Differences:** ROSES provides more detailed guidance on searching grey literature and stakeholder consultation, which are crucial for policy but less central to evolutionary theory. However, both standards aim to reduce research waste and increase transparency [cite: 18, 22].

## 5. Critical Analysis: Adherence and Quality

Since the publication of PRISMA-EcoEvo, several meta-evaluations have assessed the field's compliance. The results paint a complex picture of a discipline in transition.

### 5.1 The Reporting vs. Execution Gap
Pappalardo et al. (2023) conducted a comprehensive meta-evaluation of ecological meta-analyses. They found a distinct divergence between reporting and execution:
*   **Reporting:** Authors are increasingly better at stating what they did. Compliance with reporting criteria is generally higher than execution criteria [cite: 5, 6].
*   **Execution:** Methodological rigor remains low. For instance, while most meta-analyses include multiple effect sizes per study, only 66% acknowledged some type of non-independence [cite: 5, 7].

### 5.2 Specific Failures in Execution
1.  **Weighting:** A fundamental tenet of meta-analysis is weighting effect sizes by precision (usually inverse variance). Pappalardo et al. found that only 42% of re-analyzed studies used inverse variance weighting. A shocking 36% did not weight effect sizes at all, treating a study with n=5 the same as one with n=500 [cite: 5, 7].
2.  **Phylogeny:** Despite the availability of sophisticated comparative methods, compliance with correcting for phylogenetic non-independence remains low [cite: 6, 7].
3.  **Heterogeneity:** While medical meta-analyses often aim to minimize heterogeneity to find a "true" treatment effect, ecological data is inherently heterogeneous. However, many studies fail to adequately quantify or explore the sources of this heterogeneity (e.g., via meta-regression) [cite: 12, 23].

### 5.3 The Impact of Guidelines
There is evidence that guidelines work. O'Dea et al. (2021) found that the minority of papers (approx. 16%) that referenced a reporting guideline showed substantially higher reporting quality than the average [cite: 3, 4, 14]. This suggests that the low quality observed in the field is not due to a lack of capability, but a lack of awareness or enforcement of standards.

## 6. Applications and Case Studies

The utility of PRISMA-EcoEvo is best understood through its application across diverse sub-fields.

### 6.1 Sexual Selection and Evolutionary Biology
Sexual selection research relies heavily on meta-analysis to generalize across taxa (e.g., do ornaments signal male quality?).
*   **Case Study:** A systematic map of sexual selection meta-analyses revealed severe taxonomic biases (dominance of bird studies) and frequent omission of key methodological details [cite: 24].
*   **Application:** Recent studies have used PRISMA-EcoEvo to highlight that while mean effect sizes in sexual selection are often small, the *heterogeneity* is high, suggesting case-dependent evolutionary pathways [cite: 12, 25].

### 6.2 Invasion Biology
Invasion biology has significant policy implications, making the reliability of meta-analyses critical.
*   **Case Study:** A global meta-analysis on the impacts of invasive species in protected areas utilized the PRISMA-EcoEvo protocol to ensure rigorous inclusion criteria (PICO framework) [cite: 26].
*   **Functional Traits:** Reviews on functional trait variation along invasion pathways have adopted PRISMA-EcoEvo to manage the complexity of comparing physiological traits across disparate animal groups [cite: 27].
*   **Impact:** The use of these guidelines in invasion science helps filter out low-quality evidence that could lead to misguided management or eradication programs [cite: 28, 29].

### 6.3 Marine Science and Conservation
In marine ecology, PRISMA-EcoEvo has been used to identify success stories in top predator conservation. By enforcing strict reporting, researchers could isolate the factors (e.g., social enforcement, community support) that genuinely contribute to Marine Protected Area (MPA) success, separating them from noise generated by poorly designed studies [cite: 30].

---

## 7. Challenges and Open Problems

Despite the availability of PRISMA-EcoEvo, several challenges hinder its universal adoption and effectiveness.

### 7.1 Complexity of Ecological Data
Ecological data is "messy." Unlike standardized clinical trials, ecological experiments vary wildly in design, scale, and measurement units.
*   **Subjectivity:** Even with guidelines, subjective decisions are inevitable (e.g., defining "habitat fragmentation"). PRISMA-EcoEvo advises transparency, but it cannot eliminate the subjectivity inherent in defining ecological concepts [cite: 12, 31].
*   **The "Vote Counting" Problem:** Some studies claim to be meta-analyses but resort to "vote counting" (tallying significant vs. non-significant results) rather than calculating effect sizes. This approach is statistically flawed but persists due to the difficulty of extracting usable data from primary literature [cite: 18].

### 7.2 Resistance and Training Gaps
There is a steep learning curve associated with rigorous meta-analysis.
*   **Skill Gap:** Many ecologists lack formal training in advanced meta-analytic techniques (e.g., multi-level models, phylogenetic regression). This leads to the "execution gap" where authors report their methods well, but the methods themselves are outdated [cite: 5, 7].
*   **Perception:** Some researchers view checklists as bureaucratic hurdles rather than scientific tools. The community perception of quality often exceeds the actual measured quality, leading to complacency [cite: 3, 14].

### 7.3 Data Availability
A major bottleneck is the availability of primary data. PRISMA-EcoEvo encourages data sharing, but if primary authors do not share raw data, meta-analysts are forced to rely on summary statistics, which limits the precision of the synthesis [cite: 5].

---

## 8. Future Research Directions

### 8.1 AI and Automation in Evidence Synthesis
The most significant emerging frontier is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the systematic review process.
*   **Automated Screening:** Tools like Elicit and Rayyan are being tested to automate the screening of titles and abstracts. Early feasibility studies suggest that while AI can accelerate data extraction, it requires rigorous validation against human "gold standards" [cite: 10, 11].
*   **PRISMA Compliance:** AI could potentially be used to audit manuscripts for PRISMA-EcoEvo compliance automatically, flagging missing items (e.g., "No funding statement found") before peer review [cite: 2].

### 8.2 Living Systematic Reviews
The concept of "living" reviews—syntheses that are continuously updated as new evidence becomes available—is gaining traction. PRISMA-EcoEvo could be adapted to support dynamic protocols where the search strategy and inclusion criteria are permanently registered and updated [cite: 13].

### 8.3 Integration with Open Science
Future research should focus on tightening the link between PRISMA-EcoEvo and Open Science practices. This includes:
*   **Registered Reports:** Encouraging the peer review of the meta-analysis *protocol* (using PRISMA-P or EcoEvo) before the search is conducted to prevent outcome-dependent bias [cite: 8, 22].
*   **Data Standards:** Developing standardized data ontologies for ecology to make automated meta-analysis more feasible [cite: 32].

## 9. Conclusion

The introduction of PRISMA-EcoEvo represents a maturation of ecology and evolutionary biology as data-driven disciplines. By acknowledging that evidence synthesis requires the same methodological rigor as primary data collection, the field is moving away from subjective narrative reviews toward reproducible science.

However, the existence of a checklist is not a panacea. The persistent gap between reporting quality and execution quality highlights the need for better statistical training and stricter enforcement by journal editors. As O'Dea et al. (2021) and subsequent critiques have shown, transparency is the first step: it allows the community to see the "wolves" of bias for what they are. The next step is to ensure that the underlying science is as robust as the reporting is clear. Through the combined adoption of PRISMA-EcoEvo, open science practices, and emerging AI tools, ecology can achieve a standard of evidence synthesis that is truly trustworthy and cumulative.
