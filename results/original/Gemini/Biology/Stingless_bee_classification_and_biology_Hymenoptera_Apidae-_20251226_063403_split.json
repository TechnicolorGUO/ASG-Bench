      "content": "Stingless bees (Meliponini) represent a ubiquitous and diverse element of the pantropical melittofauna, playing critical roles as pollinators and producers of medicinal hive products. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current state of stingless bee classification and biology, integrating classical morphological taxonomy with emerging phylogenomic evidence. We analyze the recent taxonomic overhaul by Engel et al. (2023), which recognizes 605 extant species and 45 genera, and discuss the implications of recent genomic studies that challenge the monophyly of several Neotropical genera. Furthermore, we examine the unique biological mechanisms of the tribe, particularly the divergent caste determination strategies between *Melipona* and the Trigonini, and the sophisticated recruitment communication systems that function without the honey bee waggle dance. Finally, we review the burgeoning field of meliponiculture and the therapeutic validation of stingless bee honey and propolis, identifying key research gaps in standardization and conservation."

      "heading": "1. Introduction",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The tribe Meliponini (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Apinae), commonly known as stingless bees, constitutes the largest and most diverse group of eusocial corbiculate bees. Distributed across the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, these bees are distinguished by the reduction of the sting apparatus, which is no longer functional for defense, and the maintenance of perennial colonies [cite: 1, 2]. With a diversity that far exceeds that of the true honey bees (Apini) and bumble bees (Bombini), stingless bees are keystone pollinators in tropical forests and agricultural ecosystems [cite: 2, 3].\n\nHistorically, the classification of this tribe has been a subject of intense debate, oscillating between systems that lump species into a few massive genera (e.g., *Trigona* sensu lato) and those that split them into numerous smaller, morphologically distinct genera. The recent publication of a comprehensive review and key by Engel et al. (2023) marks a significant milestone in stabilizing the taxonomy of the group, recognizing 45 extant genera and over 600 species [cite: 2, 4]. Concurrently, advances in phylogenomics have begun to unravel the deep evolutionary history of the clade, providing new insights into their biogeography and the evolution of eusociality [cite: 5, 6].\n\nBeyond systematics, the biology of stingless bees offers unique comparative models for understanding social evolution. Unlike the well-studied *Apis mellifera*, many stingless bees exhibit distinct mechanisms for caste determination, resource recruitment, and nest architecture [cite: 7, 8]. Furthermore, the cultural and economic importance of these bees—through the practice of meliponiculture—is expanding globally, driven by the unique medicinal properties of their honey and propolis [cite: 9, 10]. This review aims to synthesize these diverse strands of research, providing a holistic overview of the field."

      "content": "The taxon Meliponini was first erected by Burmeister in 1876, though the group had been recognized earlier by Lepeletier in 1836 [cite: 1]. For much of the 20th century, the classification of stingless bees was dominated by the \"Schwarz system.\" Herbert F. Schwarz, in his monumental works (e.g., 1948), classified the vast majority of stingless bees into the single genus *Trigona*, treating morphologically distinct groups as subgenera [cite: 2, 11]. This conservative approach, while simplifying nomenclature, often obscured the immense morphological and biological diversity within the tribe."

      "content": "A paradigm shift occurred through the work of Jesus S. Moure, who established the foundations for the modern, multi-generic classification system. Moure, along with collaborators like Kerr and Camargo, argued for the elevation of many subgenera to generic rank based on detailed morphological characters [cite: 2, 11]. This \"splitting\" approach better reflected the deep divergences within the tribe and facilitated more precise biogeographic analyses.\n\nThe legacy of Moure and Camargo was consolidated in recent catalogs and revisions, culminating in the work of Engel et al. (2023). This recent review validates the multi-generic system, providing updated keys and checklists that recognize the distinct evolutionary trajectories of groups previously buried within *Trigona* [cite: 2, 4]."

The oldest definitive stingless bee is *Cretotrigona prisca* from Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous) amber of New Jersey, indicating that the group had already diverged and diversified by the end of the Mesozoic [cite: 1, 12]. Recent discoveries continue to enrich this record, such as the description of *Adactylurina* from Miocene amber in Ethiopia, which provides crucial data on the historical biogeography of Afrotropical lineages [cite: 2, 13]."

The classification divides the tribe geographically and morphologically, though the subtribal classification (e.g., Meliponina for Neotropical taxa) remains a subject of discussion.\n\n**Key Genera and Distributions:**\n*   **Neotropical Region:** This region hosts the highest diversity, with 474 extant species and 26 genera. Major genera include *Melipona*, *Trigona*, *Scaptotrigona*, *Partamona*, and *Plebeia* [cite: 2, 14]. All Neotropical stingless bees belong to the subtribe Meliponina [cite: 2].\n*   **Afrotropical Region:** Diversity is lower, with genera such as *Meliponula*, *Dactylurina*, *Cleptotrigona*, *Hypotrigona*, *Liotrigona*, and *Plebeina* [cite: 11].\n*   **Indo-Australasian Region:** Key genera include *Tetragonula*, *Lepidotrigona*, *Heterotrigona*, *Geniotrigona*, and *Austroplebeia* [cite: 1, 15].\n\nThe updated key provided by Engel et al.

      "content": "The integration of molecular data has revolutionized our understanding of stingless bee relationships. Early molecular phylogenies (e.g., Rasmussen & Cameron, 2010) provided a backbone, but recent phylogenomic studies using ultraconserved elements (UCEs) have offered unprecedented resolution.\n\n**Lepeco et al. (2024) Findings:**\nA landmark study by Lepeco et al. (2024) analyzed over 2,500 UCE loci across 153 species. Key findings include:\n1.  **Sister Group Relationships:** The Meliponini are confirmed as the sister group to the Bombini (bumble bees), with the Apini (honey bees) forming a sister clade to the Bombini+Meliponini lineage [cite: 5, 14]. This supports the hypothesis of independent origins of advanced eusociality in honey bees and stingless bees.\n2.  **Generic Monophyly:** Most genera recognized by Engel et al. (2023) were recovered as monophyletic. However, significant exceptions were noted. The genera *Plebeia*, *Frieseomelitta*, and *Scaura* were found to be paraphyletic or polyphyletic, indicating that further taxonomic revision is necessary to align the classification with evolutionary history [cite: 16].\n3.  **Biogeography:** The data strongly support a Gondwanan origin for the tribe, with subsequent vicariance and dispersal events shaping the current pantropical distribution [cite: 16]."

      "heading": "4.1 Caste Determination: The *Melipona* Enigma",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "One of the most fascinating aspects of stingless bee biology is the mechanism of caste determination, which differs fundamentally from that of honey bees (*Apis*).\n\n*   **Trophic Determination (Trigonini):** In most stingless bee genera (e.g., *Trigona*, *Scaptotrigona*), caste is determined by the quantity of food. Queen larvae are reared in larger, specialized royal cells and consume significantly more provisions than worker larvae [cite: 17, 18, 19].\n*   **Genetic-Environmental Determination (*Melipona*):** In the genus *Melipona*, queens and workers are reared in identical cells with similar amounts of food. Caste determination follows the \"Kerr hypothesis,\" which proposes a genetic basis (two-loci/two-alleles) modulated by environmental factors [cite: 8]. Under this model, only double heterozygotes have the potential to become queens, provided nutrient levels are sufficient to trigger the hormonal cascade (Juvenile Hormone) [cite: 8, 17].\n\n**Epigenetic Regulation:**\nRecent research has highlighted the role of epigenetics in this process. Studies on *Melipona scutellaris* have shown differential DNA methylation and histone modification patterns between developing queens and workers [cite: 8]. Specifically, the expression of *fem* (feminizer gene) and *Am-dam* (DNA methyltransferase) varies by caste, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms link the genetic potential and nutritional input to the final phenotype [cite: 8]."

Instead, they have evolved a diverse array of recruitment mechanisms to guide nestmates to resources.\n\n*   **Pheromone Trails:** Many species (e.g., *Trigona*, *Scaptotrigona*) deposit pheromone trails from labial glands on vegetation between the food source and the nest to create an olfactory corridor [cite: 20, 21, 22].\n*   **Sound and Vibration:** Returning foragers often produce pulsed thoracic vibrations inside the nest. The temporal pattern of these pulses can convey information about the quality or distance of the resource [cite: 22, 23].\n*   **Piloting and Jostling:** In some species, recruitment relies on \"jostling\" (excited running and bumping into nestmates) to stimulate activity, followed by piloting, where the scout guides recruits part of the way to the source [cite: 20, 22]."

Biologically, the tribe exhibits a remarkable plasticity in social organization, from the genetic caste determination of *Melipona* to the complex recruitment strategies of the Trigonini. As the global interest in meliponiculture grows, driven by the potent medicinal properties of stingless bee products, it is imperative that scientific research keeps pace. Addressing the taxonomic impediments and establishing conservation frameworks will be essential to sustain both the biodiversity of these critical pollinators and the livelihoods of the communities that depend on them."
