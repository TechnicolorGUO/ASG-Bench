      "content": "Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) has established itself as a cornerstone of preclinical biomedical research, offering a non-invasive, highly sensitive modality for longitudinal monitoring of biological processes in living subjects. Unlike fluorescence imaging, which requires external excitation light and often suffers from high background autofluorescence, BLI relies on the enzymatic oxidation of a substrate (luciferin) by a luciferase enzyme to generate photons [cite: 1, 2]. This \"glow-in-the-dark\" mechanism provides an exceptional signal-to-background ratio, making it indispensable for tracking tumor burden, infectious disease progression, and gene expression patterns [cite: 3, 4].\n\nHowever, the application of traditional BLI has historically been constrained by the optical properties of biological tissue. Hemoglobin, melanin, and water absorb visible light, while lipids and cellular structures scatter it, severely attenuating photons emitted from deep tissues [cite: 1, 5]. Consequently, the \"holy grail\" of BLI research has been to shift emission spectra into the near-infrared (NIR) window (650–900 nm) and the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window (1000–1700 nm), where tissue transparency is maximized [cite: 6, 7].\n\nThis review provides a comprehensive analysis of the recent \"brightening\" of biology through advanced luciferase systems. We examine the transition from native enzymes to engineered powerhouses like AkaLuc and NanoLuc, explore the 2024-2025 breakthroughs in synthetic substrates like AkaSuke, and discuss the integration of deep learning in tomographic reconstruction. Furthermore, we highlight novel functional applications such as Bioluminescent Optogenetics (BL-OG) and MRI-linked bioluminescence (BLUsH), which are redefining the boundaries of in vivo optical imaging."

This pair produces emission centered around 677 nm (NIR-I). Crucially, AkaLumine possesses superior blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability compared to D-luciferin. Studies have shown AkaLuc/AkaLumine to be 100- to 1000-fold brighter in vivo than the FLuc/D-luciferin system, enabling the detection of single cells in the lungs and deep brain structures [cite: 5, 17, 21, 22].\n\n*   **AkaSuke (2025 Breakthrough):**\n    In early 2025, Saito-Moriya et al. introduced **AkaSuke**, a synthetic firefly luciferin analog with a thiazole ring introduced into the AkaLumine scaffold. AkaSuke generates intense NIR bioluminescence ($\\lambda_{max} = 680$ nm). When paired with a newly identified Japanese firefly luciferase variant, **DkumLuc1**, it achieves detection sensitivities comparable to or exceeding the AkaLumine/AkaLuc system. Notably, AkaSuke demonstrated a 7.7-fold higher signal from lung metastases compared to D-luciferin and allows for sensitive visualization of ectopic hematogenesis [cite: 19, 23].\n\n*   **CouLuc and Multiplexing:**\n    The **CouLuc** system (Coumarin-based luciferins) represents a shift toward orthogonal pairs for multiplexed imaging. CouLuc-1 and its evolved enzyme **Pecan** emit red light and are chemically distinct from D-luciferin. This orthogonality allows researchers to image two distinct biological events simultaneously in the same animal by sequentially injecting different substrates (e.g., D-luciferin followed by CouLuc-1) without cross-reactivity [cite: 24, 25, 26, 27].\n\n*   **Infraluciferin (iLH2):**\n    Another approach involves **infraluciferin (iLH2)**, a substrate that can produce emissions ranging from visible green to NIR depending on the specific luciferase mutant used. This single-substrate, multi-color capability simplifies dual-parameter imaging, allowing for the spectral unmixing of different cell populations [cite: 28, 29, 30]."

NLuc is a 19 kDa enzyme engineered from the deep-sea shrimp *Oplophorus gracilirostris*, utilizing the substrate **furimazine**. It is approximately 150-fold brighter than FLuc but emits blue light ($\\sim$460 nm), which is heavily attenuated in tissue [cite: 10, 11].\n\nTo harness NLuc's brightness for in vivo imaging, it is often incorporated into BRET systems:\n*   **Antares:** This construct fuses NLuc with two copies of **CyOFP1**, a cyan-excitable orange fluorescent protein. The BRET efficiency is high, effectively converting NLuc's blue energy into orange-red emission ($\\sim$584 nm). Antares has demonstrated significantly higher signal-to-background ratios in deep tissues compared to FLuc, primarily because the substrate furimazine has lower background autoluminescence than D-luciferin [cite: 14, 15]."

When the luciferin is administered, the luciferase emits light that activates the opsin, modulating neuronal activity. This allows for \"chemogenetic\" control using optogenetic mechanisms without implanted fiber optics. Recent 2024 studies have demonstrated non-invasive, dose-dependent activation of brain circuits using BL-OG, offering a safer alternative to deep brain stimulation [cite: 35, 36, 37, 38].\n\n*   **BLUsH (Bioluminescence Using Hemodynamics):**\n    A groundbreaking 2024 study by Ohlendorf et al.

Vascular cells are engineered to express a photoactivated adenylate cyclase (bPAC). When proximal bioluminescent cells emit light, bPAC triggers vasodilation.

Accurate reconstruction requires precise anatomical priors (CT/MRI), complicating the workflow [cite: 32, 42].\n2.  **Substrate Delivery and Cost:** Synthetic substrates like AkaLumine and furimazine are significantly more expensive than D-luciferin. Furthermore, while AkaLumine crosses the BBB well, other substrates (like coelenterazine) have poor solubility and biodistribution, limiting their use in the brain [cite: 5, 22].\n3.  **ATP Dependence vs. Independence:** FLuc's ATP dependence is a double-edged sword; it indicates cell viability but can lead to false negatives in hypoxic/necrotic tumor regions. Conversely, NanoLuc (ATP-independent) may remain active in metabolically compromised cells, potentially overestimating viable cell counts in therapeutic studies [cite: 10, 43].\n4.  **Spectral Overlap:** In multiplexed imaging, separating signals from multiple luciferases (e.g., green FLuc vs. red FLuc) requires spectral unmixing algorithms that can be prone to artifacts if the emission peaks are not sufficiently distinct [cite: 28, 29]."

They allow researchers to visualize and quantify the intricate dance of cellular processes—metastasis, infection, and neural signaling—within the intact, living organism with unprecedented clarity and precision.
