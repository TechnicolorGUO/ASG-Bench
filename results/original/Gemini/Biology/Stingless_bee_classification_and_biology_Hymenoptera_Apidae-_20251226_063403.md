# Stingless Bee Classification and Biology (Hymenoptera, Apidae): A Comprehensive Review with Updated Perspectives on Genera and Subgenera

**Key Points**
*   **Taxonomic Authority:** The most recent comprehensive classification by Engel et al. (2023) recognizes 605 extant species across 45 genera, establishing the Meliponini as the most diverse corbiculate bee tribe.
*   **Phylogenomic Advances:** Recent ultraconserved element (UCE) analyses (Lepeco et al., 2024) largely support the current generic classification but highlight paraphyly in traditionally difficult groups like *Plebeia* and *Frieseomelitta*, necessitating future revision.
*   **Caste Determination:** A distinct biological divide exists between the genus *Melipona* (where caste is determined by a genetic-environmental interaction) and other stingless bees (where caste is strictly trophic/nutritional).
*   **Medicinal Potential:** Stingless bee honey (pot-honey) and propolis exhibit unique physicochemical properties, including high antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, driving a surge in research regarding their therapeutic applications for diabetes, wound healing, and cancer.

## Abstract

Stingless bees (Meliponini) represent a ubiquitous and diverse element of the pantropical melittofauna, playing critical roles as pollinators and producers of medicinal hive products. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current state of stingless bee classification and biology, integrating classical morphological taxonomy with emerging phylogenomic evidence. We analyze the recent taxonomic overhaul by Engel et al. (2023), which recognizes 605 extant species and 45 genera, and discuss the implications of recent genomic studies that challenge the monophyly of several Neotropical genera. Furthermore, we examine the unique biological mechanisms of the tribe, particularly the divergent caste determination strategies between *Melipona* and the Trigonini, and the sophisticated recruitment communication systems that function without the honey bee waggle dance. Finally, we review the burgeoning field of meliponiculture and the therapeutic validation of stingless bee honey and propolis, identifying key research gaps in standardization and conservation.

## 1. Introduction

The tribe Meliponini (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Apinae), commonly known as stingless bees, constitutes the largest and most diverse group of eusocial corbiculate bees. Distributed across the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, these bees are distinguished by the reduction of the sting apparatus, which is no longer functional for defense, and the maintenance of perennial colonies [cite: 1, 2]. With a diversity that far exceeds that of the true honey bees (Apini) and bumble bees (Bombini), stingless bees are keystone pollinators in tropical forests and agricultural ecosystems [cite: 2, 3].

Historically, the classification of this tribe has been a subject of intense debate, oscillating between systems that lump species into a few massive genera (e.g., *Trigona* sensu lato) and those that split them into numerous smaller, morphologically distinct genera. The recent publication of a comprehensive review and key by Engel et al. (2023) marks a significant milestone in stabilizing the taxonomy of the group, recognizing 45 extant genera and over 600 species [cite: 2, 4]. Concurrently, advances in phylogenomics have begun to unravel the deep evolutionary history of the clade, providing new insights into their biogeography and the evolution of eusociality [cite: 5, 6].

Beyond systematics, the biology of stingless bees offers unique comparative models for understanding social evolution. Unlike the well-studied *Apis mellifera*, many stingless bees exhibit distinct mechanisms for caste determination, resource recruitment, and nest architecture [cite: 7, 8]. Furthermore, the cultural and economic importance of these bees—through the practice of meliponiculture—is expanding globally, driven by the unique medicinal properties of their honey and propolis [cite: 9, 10]. This review aims to synthesize these diverse strands of research, providing a holistic overview of the field.

## 2. Historical Development and Milestones in Classification

### 2.1 Early Taxonomy and the "Lumping" Era
The taxon Meliponini was first erected by Burmeister in 1876, though the group had been recognized earlier by Lepeletier in 1836 [cite: 1]. For much of the 20th century, the classification of stingless bees was dominated by the "Schwarz system." Herbert F. Schwarz, in his monumental works (e.g., 1948), classified the vast majority of stingless bees into the single genus *Trigona*, treating morphologically distinct groups as subgenera [cite: 2, 11]. This conservative approach, while simplifying nomenclature, often obscured the immense morphological and biological diversity within the tribe.

### 2.2 The Moure System and Modern Systematics
A paradigm shift occurred through the work of Jesus S. Moure, who established the foundations for the modern, multi-generic classification system. Moure, along with collaborators like Kerr and Camargo, argued for the elevation of many subgenera to generic rank based on detailed morphological characters [cite: 2, 11]. This "splitting" approach better reflected the deep divergences within the tribe and facilitated more precise biogeographic analyses.

The legacy of Moure and Camargo was consolidated in recent catalogs and revisions, culminating in the work of Engel et al. (2023). This recent review validates the multi-generic system, providing updated keys and checklists that recognize the distinct evolutionary trajectories of groups previously buried within *Trigona* [cite: 2, 4].

### 2.3 The Fossil Record
The evolutionary history of Meliponini is supported by a rich fossil record. The oldest definitive stingless bee is *Cretotrigona prisca* from Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous) amber of New Jersey, indicating that the group had already diverged and diversified by the end of the Mesozoic [cite: 1, 12]. Recent discoveries continue to enrich this record, such as the description of *Adactylurina* from Miocene amber in Ethiopia, which provides crucial data on the historical biogeography of Afrotropical lineages [cite: 2, 13].

## 3. Current State-of-the-Art: Systematics and Phylogeny

### 3.1 Updated Classification (Engel et al., 2023)
The most current systematic treatment recognizes 605 described extant species distributed among 45 genera [cite: 2, 13]. The classification divides the tribe geographically and morphologically, though the subtribal classification (e.g., Meliponina for Neotropical taxa) remains a subject of discussion.

**Key Genera and Distributions:**
*   **Neotropical Region:** This region hosts the highest diversity, with 474 extant species and 26 genera. Major genera include *Melipona*, *Trigona*, *Scaptotrigona*, *Partamona*, and *Plebeia* [cite: 2, 14]. All Neotropical stingless bees belong to the subtribe Meliponina [cite: 2].
*   **Afrotropical Region:** Diversity is lower, with genera such as *Meliponula*, *Dactylurina*, *Cleptotrigona*, *Hypotrigona*, *Liotrigona*, and *Plebeina* [cite: 11].
*   **Indo-Australasian Region:** Key genera include *Tetragonula*, *Lepidotrigona*, *Heterotrigona*, *Geniotrigona*, and *Austroplebeia* [cite: 1, 15].

The updated key provided by Engel et al. (2023) utilizes external morphology, focusing on wing venation, leg structure (corbicula and rastellum), and integument sculpture to differentiate these groups [cite: 2, 4].

### 3.2 Phylogenomic Insights
The integration of molecular data has revolutionized our understanding of stingless bee relationships. Early molecular phylogenies (e.g., Rasmussen & Cameron, 2010) provided a backbone, but recent phylogenomic studies using ultraconserved elements (UCEs) have offered unprecedented resolution.

**Lepeco et al. (2024) Findings:**
A landmark study by Lepeco et al. (2024) analyzed over 2,500 UCE loci across 153 species. Key findings include:
1.  **Sister Group Relationships:** The Meliponini are confirmed as the sister group to the Bombini (bumble bees), with the Apini (honey bees) forming a sister clade to the Bombini+Meliponini lineage [cite: 5, 14]. This supports the hypothesis of independent origins of advanced eusociality in honey bees and stingless bees.
2.  **Generic Monophyly:** Most genera recognized by Engel et al. (2023) were recovered as monophyletic. However, significant exceptions were noted. The genera *Plebeia*, *Frieseomelitta*, and *Scaura* were found to be paraphyletic or polyphyletic, indicating that further taxonomic revision is necessary to align the classification with evolutionary history [cite: 16].
3.  **Biogeography:** The data strongly support a Gondwanan origin for the tribe, with subsequent vicariance and dispersal events shaping the current pantropical distribution [cite: 16].

## 4. Biological Mechanisms and Life History

### 4.1 Caste Determination: The *Melipona* Enigma
One of the most fascinating aspects of stingless bee biology is the mechanism of caste determination, which differs fundamentally from that of honey bees (*Apis*).

*   **Trophic Determination (Trigonini):** In most stingless bee genera (e.g., *Trigona*, *Scaptotrigona*), caste is determined by the quantity of food. Queen larvae are reared in larger, specialized royal cells and consume significantly more provisions than worker larvae [cite: 17, 18, 19].
*   **Genetic-Environmental Determination (*Melipona*):** In the genus *Melipona*, queens and workers are reared in identical cells with similar amounts of food. Caste determination follows the "Kerr hypothesis," which proposes a genetic basis (two-loci/two-alleles) modulated by environmental factors [cite: 8]. Under this model, only double heterozygotes have the potential to become queens, provided nutrient levels are sufficient to trigger the hormonal cascade (Juvenile Hormone) [cite: 8, 17].

**Epigenetic Regulation:**
Recent research has highlighted the role of epigenetics in this process. Studies on *Melipona scutellaris* have shown differential DNA methylation and histone modification patterns between developing queens and workers [cite: 8]. Specifically, the expression of *fem* (feminizer gene) and *Am-dam* (DNA methyltransferase) varies by caste, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms link the genetic potential and nutritional input to the final phenotype [cite: 8].

### 4.2 Communication and Recruitment
Unlike honey bees, stingless bees do not perform a waggle dance. Instead, they have evolved a diverse array of recruitment mechanisms to guide nestmates to resources.

*   **Pheromone Trails:** Many species (e.g., *Trigona*, *Scaptotrigona*) deposit pheromone trails from labial glands on vegetation between the food source and the nest to create an olfactory corridor [cite: 20, 21, 22].
*   **Sound and Vibration:** Returning foragers often produce pulsed thoracic vibrations inside the nest. The temporal pattern of these pulses can convey information about the quality or distance of the resource [cite: 22, 23].
*   **Piloting and Jostling:** In some species, recruitment relies on "jostling" (excited running and bumping into nestmates) to stimulate activity, followed by piloting, where the scout guides recruits part of the way to the source [cite: 20, 22].

### 4.3 Nesting Biology
Stingless bees exhibit remarkable architectural diversity. Nests are typically constructed in cavities (hollow trees, ground) using **cerumen**, a mixture of wax secreted by the bees and plant resins (propolis) [cite: 1, 24]. The internal structure includes horizontal brood combs (or clustered cells in some genera like *Frieseomelitta*) enclosed in an involucrum (sheath) for thermoregulation, and separate storage pots for honey and pollen [cite: 1, 2].

## 5. Applications: Meliponiculture and Medicinal Properties

### 5.1 Meliponiculture
The keeping of stingless bees, or meliponiculture, is an ancient practice indigenous to the Neotropics (e.g., by the Maya) and is seeing a global resurgence [cite: 1, 25]. Unlike apiculture, meliponiculture is often integrated into agroforestry systems and contributes to the conservation of native biodiversity.

### 5.2 Physicochemical Properties of Pot-Honey
Stingless bee honey (SBH) differs significantly from *Apis* honey. It is stored in cerumen pots rather than wax combs, which influences its chemical composition.
*   **Moisture and Acidity:** SBH typically has higher water content (20–40%) and higher acidity (lower pH) than *Apis* honey, giving it a distinctive sour taste and fluid texture [cite: 26, 27, 28].
*   **Sugar Profile:** While rich in fructose and glucose, some species produce honey with unique sugars like trehalulose, which has a lower glycemic index [cite: 27].

### 5.3 Therapeutic Applications
A systematic review of the literature reveals extensive traditional and clinical interest in the medicinal properties of SBH and propolis.
*   **Wound Healing:** SBH exhibits potent wound-healing activity, attributed to its antioxidant capacity, hydrogen peroxide production, and synergistic phenolic compounds. It promotes tissue regeneration and reduces inflammation [cite: 28, 29].
*   **Antimicrobial Activity:** Studies have demonstrated efficacy against resistant pathogens, including *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. The antimicrobial action is often superior to that of *Apis* honey due to distinct phytochemicals derived from diverse resin sources [cite: 9, 27].
*   **Chronic Diseases:** Emerging research suggests potential applications in managing diabetes (via glycemic control) and cancer (antiproliferative effects of propolis), particularly in studies from Malaysia and Brazil [cite: 10, 24, 26].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

### 6.1 The Linnean Shortfall
Despite the recent taxonomic synthesis, a significant "Linnean shortfall" remains. Many species, particularly in the Amazon and Indo-Malayan regions, remain undescribed or are part of cryptic species complexes (e.g., *Tetragonisca angustula* complex) [cite: 16]. The paraphyly of major genera like *Plebeia* complicates biodiversity assessments and conservation planning [cite: 16].

### 6.2 Standardization of Hive Products
The commercialization of SBH is hindered by a lack of international quality standards. Current regulations (e.g., Codex Alimentarius) are based on *Apis* honey parameters (low moisture), which SBH naturally exceeds. This leads to fermentation issues and regulatory barriers [cite: 26, 27].

### 6.3 Conservation Threats
Stingless bees face severe threats from deforestation, pesticide exposure, and climate change. As they are often dependent on specific nesting trees and resin sources, habitat fragmentation has a disproportionate impact on their populations [cite: 10, 16].

## 7. Future Research Directions

1.  **Integrative Taxonomy:** Future revisions must integrate morphological data with UCE phylogenomics to resolve the paraphyly of *Plebeia* and *Frieseomelitta*, potentially erecting new genera or redefining existing ones [cite: 16].
2.  **Genomic Mechanisms of Caste:** Further exploration of the epigenetic landscape (methylome and transcriptome) is needed to fully decode the gene regulatory networks governing caste determination in *Melipona* versus Trigonini [cite: 8, 30].
3.  **Clinical Trials:** While in vitro and animal studies are promising, robust randomized clinical trials are required to validate the therapeutic efficacy of SBH and propolis for human medical use [cite: 10, 26].
4.  **Standardization:** Developing specific quality standards for pot-honey that account for its natural high moisture and acidity is crucial for the economic viability of meliponiculture [cite: 27].

## 8. Conclusion

The classification and biology of stingless bees have entered a dynamic era of discovery. The comprehensive review by Engel et al. (2023) provides a solid taxonomic foundation, while phylogenomic studies by Lepeco et al. (2024) challenge us to refine our understanding of their evolutionary history. Biologically, the tribe exhibits a remarkable plasticity in social organization, from the genetic caste determination of *Melipona* to the complex recruitment strategies of the Trigonini. As the global interest in meliponiculture grows, driven by the potent medicinal properties of stingless bee products, it is imperative that scientific research keeps pace. Addressing the taxonomic impediments and establishing conservation frameworks will be essential to sustain both the biodiversity of these critical pollinators and the livelihoods of the communities that depend on them.
