# Advancing a Temporal Framework for Understanding the Biology of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury: An Expert Review

### Abstract
**Background:** Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI)—the deliberate destruction of body tissue without suicidal intent—is a pervasive public health concern, particularly among adolescents. While psychosocial models have long dominated the field, recent years have witnessed a surge in neurobiological research. However, findings have often been fragmented, lacking a cohesive structure to integrate static risk factors with dynamic real-time mechanisms.
**Objective:** This systematic review synthesizes existing literature to advance a temporal framework for understanding the biology of NSSI. We categorize biological evidence into distal traits (predisposing factors), proximal traits (stable biological characteristics of self-injurers), and dynamic states (physiological fluctuations immediately surrounding the act).
**Methods:** A comprehensive review of literature was conducted, encompassing neuroimaging, psychophysiology, genetics, and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies. Special attention is given to the "temporal framework" proposed by Kaess et al. (2021) and recent advancements in digital phenotyping and machine learning.
**Results:** Evidence suggests that distal biological traits, such as genetic vulnerabilities and altered neurodevelopment due to early life stress, set the stage for NSSI. Proximal traits, including structural and functional brain abnormalities in emotion regulation circuits (e.g., frontolimbic dysregulation) and the endogenous opioid system, characterize individuals who engage in NSSI. Crucially, dynamic biological states—specifically the mechanism of "pain offset relief" and autonomic fluctuations—drive the acute reinforcement of the behavior.
**Conclusion:** The integration of temporal dimensions into biological models of NSSI clarifies the distinction between vulnerability and acute triggering mechanisms. Future research must leverage real-time monitoring and advanced computational modeling to bridge the gap between static biological markers and the momentary urge to self-injure.

## 1. Introduction and Background

Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is defined as the direct, deliberate destruction of one’s own body tissue in the absence of suicidal intent [cite: 1, 2, 3]. Common methods include cutting, burning, and hitting, with prevalence rates peaking in adolescence (approximately 17-22%) and remaining significant in clinical populations (up to 50-80%) [cite: 2, 3, 4]. Despite its prevalence and its role as a robust predictor of future suicide attempts [cite: 2, 5], the biological mechanisms underpinning NSSI have historically remained understudied compared to psychosocial factors [cite: 6, 7].

The field has traditionally relied on cross-sectional studies identifying static correlates of NSSI, such as difficulty in emotion regulation or history of trauma. However, NSSI is inherently a dynamic behavior, often occurring in short bursts in response to acute distress. This discrepancy between static research designs and the dynamic nature of the phenomenon has created a "knowledge gap" regarding the neurobiological sequence of events that leads a vulnerable individual to engage in self-injury at a specific moment [cite: 7, 8].

To address this, recent expert reviews, most notably by Kaess et al. (2021), have proposed a **temporal framework** that distinguishes between biological traits (stable characteristics) and biological states (transient processes) [cite: 4, 7]. This review adopts and expands upon this framework, synthesizing decades of research to provide a comprehensive biological model of NSSI. We aim to clarify how long-term biological risks translate into immediate behavioral action, integrating findings from genetics, neuroimaging, and the emerging fields of digital phenotyping and computational psychiatry.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

### 2.1 Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI)
NSSI is distinct from suicidal behavior in terms of intent, lethality, and frequency, although the two frequently co-occur [cite: 2, 9]. The DSM-5 includes NSSI Disorder as a condition for further study, requiring engagement in NSSI on 5 or more days within the past year [cite: 10, 11].

### 2.2 The Temporal Framework
The organizing principle of this review is the tripartite temporal model [cite: 4, 7, 8]:
1.  **Distal Biological Traits:** Predisposing factors present early in development (e.g., genetics, effects of childhood maltreatment on neurodevelopment) that increase vulnerability.
2.  **Proximal Biological Traits:** Stable biological alterations observed in individuals with a history of NSSI (e.g., resting-state functional connectivity, baseline endogenous opioid levels).
3.  **Biological States:** Transient physiological and neural changes that occur immediately before, during, and after an episode of NSSI (e.g., autonomic arousal, pain processing dynamics).

### 2.3 Pain Offset Relief
A critical concept in the biological state of NSSI is "pain offset relief." This phenomenon refers to the disproportionate relief and positive affect experienced upon the cessation of a painful stimulus. It posits that the removal of pain is not merely a return to baseline but a potent reward signal that reinforces the behavior [cite: 12, 13, 14].

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

### 3.1 From Psychoanalysis to Neurobiology
Early understandings of NSSI were rooted in psychoanalytic theory, viewing self-harm as displaced aggression or a manifestation of the death drive. The late 20th century saw a shift toward functional models, identifying emotion regulation (negative reinforcement) and sensation seeking (positive reinforcement) as primary motivators [cite: 3, 6].

### 3.2 The Endogenous Opioid Hypothesis
In the 1980s and 1990s, the "addiction model" of NSSI emerged, driven by the observation that self-injury could induce analgesia and euphoria. Researchers hypothesized that NSSI was maintained by the release of endogenous opioids (e.g., $\beta$-endorphins), leading to a dependence-like cycle [cite: 15, 16]. Early trials of opioid antagonists like naltrexone provided preliminary support for this view [cite: 15, 17].

### 3.3 The RDoC Era and Temporal Integration
With the advent of the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), research shifted toward transdiagnostic biological systems (e.g., Negative Valence Systems). This era facilitated the use of advanced neuroimaging to map the neural circuits of NSSI [cite: 18, 19]. Most recently, the field has moved toward "temporal precision," utilizing Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and wearable biosensors to capture the biology of NSSI in real-time, culminating in the integrated temporal frameworks currently guiding the field [cite: 7, 20, 21].

## 4. Comprehensive Review: The Temporal Framework

### 4.1 Distal Biological Traits: The Origins of Vulnerability
Distal traits represent the "hardware" limitations or vulnerabilities acquired early in life that predispose an individual to maladaptive coping.

*   **Genetics:** Heritability estimates for NSSI range from 40% to 60%, suggesting a substantial genetic component [cite: 4]. However, specific candidate genes remain elusive, with research pointing toward polygenic risk scores involving serotonin and opioid system genes rather than single-gene determinants [cite: 3, 4].
*   **Early Life Stress and Neurodevelopment:** Childhood maltreatment is a potent distal risk factor. Neurobiologically, this manifests as alterations in the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and threat-processing circuits (e.g., amygdala). These early insults may "program" the brain for heightened stress reactivity, lowering the threshold for emotional dysregulation later in life [cite: 4, 18, 19].

### 4.2 Proximal Biological Traits: The Self-Injuring Brain
Proximal traits are the stable biological signatures found in individuals who engage in NSSI, distinguishing them from non-injuring controls.

*   **Brain Structure and Function:**
    *   *Structural Alterations:* Studies have consistently reported reduced volume in the ventral prefrontal cortex (PFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in adolescents with NSSI [cite: 3, 9]. These regions are critical for top-down emotion regulation and impulse control.
    *   *Functional Connectivity:* Resting-state fMRI reveals disrupted connectivity between the Default Mode Network (DMN) and the Salience Network, as well as frontolimbic disconnectivity [cite: 9, 10]. Specifically, blunted connectivity between the amygdala and PFC suggests a failure of regulatory regions to dampen emotional reactivity [cite: 1, 9].
    *   *Pain Processing:* Individuals with NSSI often exhibit higher pain thresholds and tolerance (hypoalgesia) as a trait [cite: 14, 22]. Neuroimaging shows altered activation in the insula and somatosensory cortices during pain processing, suggesting a decoupling of the sensory and affective components of pain [cite: 19, 23].

*   **The Endogenous Opioid System (EOS):**
    *   Basal levels of endogenous opioids (e.g., $\beta$-endorphin, met-enkephalin) are often dysregulated in NSSI populations. Some studies suggest lower baseline levels of opioids, driving a "deficiency" state that the individual attempts to correct via self-injury (which releases opioids) [cite: 15, 22]. Conversely, chronic engagement in NSSI may lead to receptor downregulation, necessitating more severe injury to achieve relief (tolerance) [cite: 16].

### 4.3 Biological States: The Dynamic Cycle of Injury
This dimension captures the transient physiological shifts that trigger and reinforce a specific act of NSSI.

*   **The Hyperarousal vs. Hypoarousal Debate:**
    *   *Hyperarousal:* The dominant theory posits that NSSI is preceded by a state of intense physiological hyperarousal (e.g., increased heart rate, skin conductance) driven by negative affect. The act of injury reduces this arousal, providing negative reinforcement [cite: 1, 8].
    *   *Hypoarousal/Dissociation:* A competing or complementary view suggests that some individuals self-injure to terminate a state of dissociation or numbness (hypoarousal), effectively "feeling something" to verify existence. Evidence shows that dissociation during NSSI is associated with less perceived pain [cite: 24].

*   **Pain Offset Relief Mechanism:**
    *   Experimental paradigms demonstrate that the *cessation* of physical pain elicits a robust positive affective response—relief—that is quantitatively distinct from baseline [cite: 12, 13].
    *   In individuals with NSSI, this relief response may be heightened or more heavily relied upon for affect regulation. The "pain offset" theory posits that the therapeutic effect of NSSI is not the pain itself, but the immediate neurobiological release (likely opioid-mediated) that occurs when the pain stops [cite: 13, 14, 25].
    *   Franklin et al. (2013) demonstrated that pain offset simultaneously reduces negative affect and increases positive affect, a dual-reinforcement mechanism that makes NSSI highly addictive [cite: 13, 26].

## 5. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

### 5.1 Advanced Neuroimaging
While early studies used simple activation tasks, current research employs **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** and **multimodal fusion** (e.g., fMRI + DTI) to map complex brain topologies.
*   *Resting-State Dynamics:* Recent studies (2024-2025) have used GNNs to identify specific circuits, such as the amygdala-parahippocampus and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)-insula pathways, as pivotal in NSSI pain processing [cite: 23, 27].
*   *Predictive Modeling:* Machine learning algorithms are now capable of predicting NSSI risk and suicidal ideation severity from resting-state functional connectivity (e.g., ALFF in the middle frontal gyrus) with high accuracy (>80%) [cite: 5, 28, 29].

### 5.2 Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and Digital Phenotyping
To capture biological *states*, researchers are moving out of the lab.
*   *Real-Time Monitoring:* EMA protocols prompt participants to report urges and behaviors multiple times daily via smartphones [cite: 11, 21, 30].
*   *Biosensors:* Wearable devices measure heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), and sleep patterns (actigraphy) continuously. This "digital phenotyping" allows for the detection of physiological precursors to NSSI (e.g., a spike in autonomic arousal) before the behavior occurs [cite: 20, 30, 31].
*   *Burst EMA:* High-frequency sampling (e.g., every 10 minutes) triggered by reported urges allows for granular analysis of the minutes leading up to injury [cite: 21].

## 6. Applications and Case Studies

### 6.1 Pharmacological Interventions: Targeting the Opioid System
Based on the endogenous opioid and pain offset theories, opioid antagonists have been explored as treatments.
*   *Naltrexone:* Systematic reviews and case series indicate that naltrexone (an opioid antagonist) can reduce the frequency and intensity of NSSI, particularly in individuals who experience euphoria or analgesia during the act [cite: 17, 32, 33, 34]. By blocking the opioid receptors, naltrexone theoretically eliminates the "reward" (relief) associated with the injury, leading to extinction of the behavior [cite: 15, 35].
*   *Dosing:* Effective doses in trials typically range from 25-50 mg/day, with some evidence for efficacy in both adolescents and adults with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) or developmental disabilities [cite: 33, 34].

### 6.2 Clinical Case Studies in Neurofeedback
Emerging applications involve using real-time fMRI or EEG neurofeedback to teach patients to regulate the specific brain circuits identified as proximal traits (e.g., dampening amygdala reactivity). While still in early stages, these techniques represent a direct application of the biological framework to treatment [cite: 36, 37].

## 7. Challenges and Open Problems

### 7.1 Heterogeneity of the Phenotype
NSSI is transdiagnostic, occurring in depression, BPD, anxiety, and autism. Biological findings often vary by primary diagnosis, making it difficult to identify a "pure" NSSI biological signature. The distinction between "NSSI Disorder" and NSSI as a symptom remains debated [cite: 2, 3].

### 7.2 The "State" Measurement Gap
While distal and proximal traits are relatively easy to measure, capturing the *biological state* of an actual NSSI episode remains ethically and logistically fraught. Lab-based pain proxies (e.g., thermal pain, electric shock) may not fully replicate the neurobiology of self-inflicted tissue damage in a highly emotional context [cite: 12, 13].

### 7.3 Specificity vs. Suicidality
Biologically distinguishing NSSI from suicidal behavior is a major challenge. Both share risk factors (e.g., serotonin dysfunction, HPA axis dysregulation). Recent models suggest that while they share distal risks, the proximal triggers and intent-related circuits may differ, but definitive neural markers distinguishing the two are not yet established [cite: 3, 5, 9].

## 8. Future Research Directions

### 8.1 Integration of Multi-Modal Data
The next generation of research must integrate data across temporal scales. For example, combining distal genetic risk scores with proximal neuroimaging markers and real-time digital phenotyping data into a unified predictive model. This "deep phenotyping" could identify who is at risk (traits) and *when* they are at risk (states) [cite: 18, 31].

### 8.2 Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs)
Leveraging digital phenotyping, future systems could detect physiological precursors to NSSI (e.g., a specific pattern of HRV and accelerometer data) and deliver real-time interventions (e.g., a DBT skill prompt) via smartphone before the behavior occurs [cite: 11].

### 8.3 Transdiagnostic Biological Targets
Research should continue to move away from diagnostic categories and focus on RDoC domains. Investigating the "pain offset" mechanism across different disorders could reveal why some individuals transition from NSSI to suicide while others do not [cite: 13, 19].

## 9. Conclusion

The biological understanding of NSSI has evolved from static, single-system theories to a complex, dynamic, and temporal framework. The integration of distal traits (genetic and developmental vulnerabilities), proximal traits (neural and opioid system alterations), and dynamic states (pain offset relief and autonomic fluctuations) provides a robust scaffold for future inquiry.
The temporal framework highlights that NSSI is not merely a symptom of a "broken" brain, but a dynamic regulatory mechanism—albeit a maladaptive one—that exploits specific neurobiological pathways (e.g., pain offset) to manage distress. By distinguishing between the stable vulnerability to NSSI and the transient state of the urge, clinicians and researchers can develop more targeted interventions, moving from general risk management to precise, real-time prevention.
