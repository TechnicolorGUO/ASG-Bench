Recent evaluations show that many meta-analyses still fail to account for non-independence or properly weight effect sizes [cite: 5, 6, 7].\n*   **Competing vs. Complementary Frameworks:** PRISMA-EcoEvo exists alongside ROSES (RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses). While ROSES is tailored for environmental management and conservation policy, PRISMA-EcoEvo is optimized for hypothesis-driven evolutionary and ecological research [cite: 8, 9].\n*   **Future Outlook:** The integration of AI tools for data extraction and the push for mandatory journal checklists are emerging as critical pathways to universalize these standards [cite: 10, 11].\n\n---"

While meta-analyses offer powerful tools for resolving disputes and identifying general patterns, their reliability is contingent upon transparent reporting and rigorous execution. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review of \"Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology\" (PRISMA-EcoEvo), a guideline extension published in 2021. We trace the historical trajectory of evidence synthesis from medical origins to ecological applications, analyzing the specific methodological deficits that necessitated the EcoEvo extension. We critically evaluate the current state of the field, highlighting the disparity between reporting quality and execution quality as identified in recent meta-evaluations. Furthermore, we compare PRISMA-EcoEvo with alternative frameworks such as ROSES, discuss applications in sub-disciplines like invasion biology and sexual selection, and identify emerging challenges related to automation and artificial intelligence. We conclude that while PRISMA-EcoEvo has established a necessary benchmark for transparency, widespread community adoption and enforcement by journals are required to mitigate the prevalence of low-quality syntheses.\n\n---"

      "content": "In the last three decades, ecology and evolutionary biology have seen a paradigm shift from narrative reviews to quantitative syntheses. Meta-analyses have become the primary vehicle for aggregating research to understand complex phenomena, such as the impacts of climate change or the strength of sexual selection [cite: 5, 12]. However, the authority of these syntheses relies heavily on the assumption that they are conducted objectively and reported transparently.\n\nA critical body of literature has emerged warning that meta-analyses can be \"wolves in sheep's clothing\"—subjective interpretations hidden under a veneer of statistical objectivity [cite: 1, 2, 13]. Without rigorous reporting standards, readers cannot distinguish between a robust synthesis and one plagued by publication bias, p-hacking, or methodological flaws. Historically, ecology has lagged behind medical sciences in adopting standardized reporting protocols, leading to a proliferation of non-reproducible syntheses [cite: 3, 6]."

The persistent gap between reporting quality and execution quality highlights the need for better statistical training and stricter enforcement by journal editors. As O'Dea et al. (2021) and subsequent critiques have shown, transparency is the first step: it allows the community to see the \"wolves\" of bias for what they are. The next step is to ensure that the underlying science is as robust as the reporting is clear. Through the combined adoption of PRISMA-EcoEvo, open science practices, and emerging AI tools, ecology can achieve a standard of evidence synthesis that is truly trustworthy and cumulative.\n\n---"
