      "heading": "1. Introduction",

      "content": "The precise separation of biological targets from complex fluids is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Traditional separation modalities, such as centrifugation, filtration, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), have long served as the gold standards. However, these methods often suffer from limitations including high equipment costs, sample contamination risks, potential bio-damage due to high shear forces, and the requirement for biochemical labeling [cite: 1, 2]. As the demand for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics and liquid biopsy technologies grows, there is an urgent need for separation techniques that are rapid, label-free, biocompatible, and capable of handling small sample volumes with high precision.\n\nAcoustofluidics, the integration of acoustics and microfluidics, has emerged as a transformative solution to these challenges. By utilizing sound waves to manipulate fluids and suspended particles within microchannels, acoustofluidics offers a non-contact mechanism to sort bioparticles based on their intrinsic physical properties—specifically size, density, and compressibility [cite: 3, 4, 5]. This technology eliminates the need for external tagging (label-free) and operates at power intensities similar to ultrasonic imaging, ensuring high biocompatibility [cite: 3].\n\nIn the last decade, and particularly between 2020 and 2024, the field has witnessed a paradigm shift from the manipulation of micron-sized cells to the isolation of nanoscale bioparticles, such as exosomes and viruses [cite: 6, 7]. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of these recent advances. It examines the fundamental physical principles, categorizes state-of-the-art device architectures (including Surface Acoustic Wave and Bulk Acoustic Wave systems), details breakthrough applications in virology and oncology, and critically assesses the challenges impeding widespread clinical translation."

The manipulation of particles in an acoustic field is primarily driven by two physical phenomena: the Acoustic Radiation Force (ARF) and Acoustic Streaming (AS)."

    {
      "heading": "2.1 Acoustic Radiation Force (ARF)",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "The ARF is a time-averaged force exerted on a particle suspended in a fluid when it interacts with an acoustic wave. In a standing wave field, this force directs particles toward either pressure nodes (minimum pressure amplitude) or antinodes (maximum pressure amplitude), depending on the particle's acoustic contrast factor relative to the medium [cite: 1, 8].\n\nThe primary ARF ($F_{rad}$) acting on a small spherical particle in a 1D standing wave is given by the Gor'kov potential:\n\\[ F_{rad} = -\\left( \\frac{\\pi p_0^2 V_p \\beta_f}{2\\lambda} \\right) \\phi (\\beta, \\rho) \\sin(2kx) \\]\nWhere:\n*   $p_0$ is the acoustic pressure amplitude.\n*   $V_p$ is the particle volume (proportional to $r^3$).\n*   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength.\n*   $\\phi$ is the acoustic contrast factor, determined by the density ($\\rho$) and compressibility ($\\beta$) of the particle and the fluid.\n\nCrucially, the force scales with the volume of the particle ($r^3$). This cubic dependence means that while micron-sized cells (e.g., 10–20 µm) experience strong acoustic forces, manipulating nanoparticles (e.g., viruses <150 nm) requires significantly higher frequencies or alternative mechanisms, a challenge that recent innovations like Bessel beams have sought to address [cite: 6, 9]."

      "heading": "2.2 Acoustic Streaming (AS)",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Acoustic streaming refers to the steady fluid flow induced by the viscous attenuation of acoustic waves. As the wave propagates and dissipates energy into the fluid, it generates a momentum flux that drives fluid motion [cite: 1, 10].\n*   **Bulk Streaming (Eckart):** Occurs in the bulk fluid, typically dominant in large chambers.\n*   **Boundary-Driven Streaming (Rayleigh/Schlichting):** Occurs within the viscous boundary layer near channel walls or particle surfaces.\n\nThe drag force ($F_{drag}$) induced by streaming is proportional to the particle radius ($r$), unlike the ARF which is proportional to $r^3$. Consequently, for sufficiently small particles (nanoparticles), the streaming-induced drag force often dominates over the radiation force, a phenomenon that can be exploited for mixing or trapping but can also hinder separation efficiency if not carefully controlled [cite: 9, 11]."

BAW devices are robust and capable of high throughput but are generally limited to lower frequencies [cite: 12, 13].\n*   **Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW):** Generated by interdigital transducers (IDTs) deposited on a piezoelectric substrate (e.g., Lithium Niobate). SAWs travel along the surface and couple into the fluid. They offer higher precision, higher frequencies, and versatility (Standing SAW vs. Traveling SAW) [cite: 12, 14]."

Lord Rayleigh (1883) later provided the theoretical underpinnings of acoustic streaming. However, the modern era of acoustofluidics began in the early 2000s with the miniaturization of transducers and the rise of microfabrication techniques.\n\n*   **Early 2000s:** Initial demonstrations of particle focusing and separation using BAW resonators in glass capillaries.\n*   **2008-2010:** The formalization of \"acoustofluidics\" as a discipline, with Henrik Bruus and others establishing comprehensive theoretical models [cite: 1].\n*   **2012-2015:** The development of **tilted-angle Standing Surface Acoustic Waves (taSSAW)**. This was a critical milestone that allowed for continuous, label-free separation of cells by angling the pressure nodes relative to the flow direction, significantly improving separation resolution [cite: 17, 18].\n*   **2018-2019:** Introduction of **3D Acoustofluidic Tweezers (3D-AFT)**, enabling simultaneous 3D manipulation and high-throughput processing [cite: 19].\n*   **2020-2024 (Recent Era):** The field expanded into the nano-regime.

By orienting the IDTs at a specific angle (e.g., 15°–30°) relative to the microchannel, the pressure nodes cross the fluid flow at an angle. As particles flow through the channel, they are pushed toward the nodes. Larger particles experience a stronger force and migrate laterally across the channel faster than smaller particles, exiting through different outlets.\n*   **Advantage:** Allows for high-resolution separation based on compressibility and size simultaneously.\n*   **Recent Optimization:** Numerical models and \"acoustic stencils\" have recently been employed to optimize the tilt angle and electrode design for sub-micron particle separation [cite: 20, 21, 22]."

This \"entanglement\" of forces allows for the rapid concentration of nanoparticles (down to 20 nm) and exosomes in less than one minute [cite: 7, 23].\n*   **Significance:** It overcomes the limitations of traditional ultracentrifugation, which is time-consuming and requires bulky equipment."
