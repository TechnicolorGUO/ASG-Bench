      "content": "**Abstract**\nThe COVID-19 pandemic represents a singular global event that simultaneously disrupted biological, economic, and psychological systems. This systematic literature review synthesizes research published between 2020 and 2025 to evaluate the tripartite impact of the pandemic on the psychology of sustainability, quality of life (QoL), and the global economy. While early literature (2020–2021) focused on acute shocks—such as lockdown-induced GDP contractions and temporary environmental improvements—later studies (2022–2025) reveal complex, long-term structural changes. Key findings indicate that while the \"anthropopause\" temporarily heightened pro-environmental awareness, the translation of this awareness into long-term sustainable behavior has been inconsistent, often hindered by \"pandemic fatigue\" and economic instability. Quality of life metrics show a K-shaped recovery, where vulnerable populations and healthcare workers continue to suffer from \"Long COVID\" sequelae and psychological distress, creating a hidden economic burden estimated at $1 trillion annually. Furthermore, the promised \"Green Recovery\" has seen mixed implementation, with significant gaps between policy rhetoric and the reality of fossil-fuel-intensive economic stimulus. This review identifies the critical need for an integrated \"One Health\" approach that treats economic resilience, psychological well-being, and environmental sustainability as inseparable variables in post-pandemic reconstruction.\n\n---"

      "content": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 precipitated a global crisis that transcended public health, triggering a cascade of failures across economic supply chains, social support systems, and individual psychological resilience. The pandemic forced a re-evaluation of the \"Triple Bottom Line\" (TBL) of sustainability—economy, society, and environment—placing unprecedented strain on the equilibrium between these pillars [cite: 1, 2]. Early in the pandemic, scholars identified a unique intersection of effects: the immediate cessation of industrial activity led to short-term environmental recovery, yet the accompanying economic paralysis and social isolation posed severe threats to human quality of life and the global economy [cite: 3, 4].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the necessity to move beyond the initial acute-phase analysis and understand the enduring structural impacts of the pandemic. Seminal works, such as El Keshky et al. (2020), established the framework for understanding these interdependencies, highlighting how the psychology of sustainability is intrinsic to economic and social recovery [cite: 3, 4]. However, as the world transitions from the acute phase to the endemic phase (2023–2025), new variables have emerged, most notably the chronic economic burden of \"Long COVID\" and the divergent outcomes of \"Green Recovery\" stimulus packages [cite: 5, 6].\n\nThis paper aims to provide a comprehensive systematic review of the literature concerning the nexus of the psychology of sustainability, QoL, and the global economy. The objectives are to: (1) analyze the evolution of pro-environmental behaviors and the psychology of sustainability amidst crisis; (2) evaluate the longitudinal impacts on global quality of life, with specific attention to mental health and Long COVID; (3) assess the efficacy of economic recovery strategies in promoting sustainability; and (4) identify research gaps to guide future policy and scholarship."

Did the \"anthropopause\" lead to any permanent shifts in consumption, or was it entirely transient? [cite: 1, 29].\n3.  **Psychological Interventions for Sustainability:** Research should focus on developing psychological interventions that can bypass \"pandemic fatigue.\" This involves framing sustainability not as an additional burden, but as a component of health recovery (e.g., the mental health benefits of green spaces) [cite: 19, 47].\n4.  **Global South Perspectives:** There is a significant lack of data on the \"Psychology of Sustainability\" in low-income countries.

This systematic review demonstrates that the pandemic's impact was not merely a temporary shock but a catalyst for structural changes in the psychology of sustainability, quality of life, and the global economy.\n\nThe literature confirms that while the pandemic initially raised awareness of environmental issues (Psychology of Sustainability), the translation of this awareness into action has been obstructed by economic instability and psychological fatigue. Quality of Life has suffered a sustained blow, particularly through the mechanism of Long COVID, which now acts as a significant drag on the Global Economy. The \"Green Recovery,\" while theoretically sound, has faced significant implementation challenges, often sidelined by the urgency of immediate economic stabilization.\n\nUltimately, \"getting through\" COVID-19 requires acknowledging that these three domains are inextricably linked. A sustainable global economy cannot exist without a healthy workforce (QoL), and a healthy workforce depends on a sustainable environment. The path forward lies in policies that do not treat these as competing interests but as a unified ecosystem of human and planetary health."
