      "content": "**Background:** In response to rising rates of adolescent psychological distress, schools have increasingly adopted Positive Psychology Interventions (PPIs). While early interventions focused on single constructs (e.g., gratitude journals), recent trends favor multicomponent interventions (MPPIs) that target multiple domains of flourishing simultaneously.\n**Objective:** This paper provides a comprehensive systematic literature review of school-based MPPIs, evaluating their effectiveness in promoting well-being and reducing distress (depression, anxiety, stress) in adolescents.\n**Methods:** A synthesis of existing meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and theoretical critiques was conducted. Key programs such as the Penn Resiliency Program, the Maytiv Program, and the Geelong Grammar School model were examined.\n**Results:** Evidence indicates that MPPIs yield small to moderate effect sizes for enhancing subjective well-being ($g \\approx 0.24$) and reducing depressive symptoms ($g \\approx 0.28$). Programs integrated into the curriculum and delivered by trained teachers generally show better sustainability than isolated workshops.\n**Conclusion:** MPPIs represent a promising, proactive mental health strategy in education. However, the field must address significant heterogeneity in study quality, implementation barriers, and valid sociological critiques regarding the \"happiness industry\" to mature into a robust pedagogical standard.\n\n---"

      "content": "The mental health of adolescents has become a global public health priority. Epidemiological data suggests a rising prevalence of internalizing disorders, such as anxiety and depression, among youth [cite: 1, 2]. Traditionally, school-based mental health initiatives operated under a \"deficit model,\" prioritizing the identification and treatment of pathology. However, the emergence of **Positive Psychology** in the late 1990s prompted a paradigm shift toward a \"strengths-based model,\" focusing on the cultivation of competencies that enable individuals to flourish rather than merely survive [cite: 1, 3].\n\nThis shift gave rise to **Positive Education**, defined as education for both traditional academic skills and happiness [cite: 3]. Within this framework, **Multicomponent Positive Psychology Interventions (MPPIs)** have emerged as a state-of-the-art approach. Unlike single-component interventions (SCIs) that target a specific trait (e.g., optimism), MPPIs integrate various exercises targeting multiple theoretical components of well-being—such as positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment (PERMA)—into a cohesive program [cite: 4, 5].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the need to critically evaluate the efficacy of these complex interventions. While individual studies report success, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have highlighted variability in outcomes, often dependent on study quality, duration, and delivery method [cite: 6, 7]. Furthermore, as the field matures, it faces scrutiny regarding cultural applicability and the potential for toxic positivity [cite: 8, 9]. This paper aims to synthesize current evidence, analyze key case studies, and discuss the structural challenges facing the implementation of MPPIs in secondary education.\n\n---"

The next generation of positive education must move beyond a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach toward culturally responsive, structurally aware, and teacher-supported models. By doing so, schools can fulfill their dual mandate: cultivating not only successful students but also flourishing human beings.\n\n---"
