Ensemble methods (e.g., XGBoost) now achieve up to 88% accuracy in churn prediction, and Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used as \"synthetic participants\" in consumer research [cite: 3, 4, 6].\n*   **Ethical Imperative:** Trust has emerged as the central currency in AI marketing. The \"black box\" nature of deep learning necessitates new governance frameworks to address privacy, bias, and the psychological effects of human-machine intimacy [cite: 7, 8].\n\n---"

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI), marketing, and consumer psychology represents one of the most dynamic and disruptive frontiers in modern business research. While early applications of AI in marketing focused on logistical optimization and basic segmentation, the proliferation of big data, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) has fundamentally reshaped how firms understand and influence consumer behavior.\n\nThis systematic literature review (SLR) aims to synthesize the rapidly expanding body of knowledge in this domain. It builds upon the foundational work of Mariani, Perez-Vega, and Wirtz (2022), who provided the first integrated view of AI across marketing, consumer research, and psychology [cite: 3, 9]. Since that seminal publication, the landscape has shifted dramatically with the advent of Generative AI (GenAI), necessitating an updated analysis of the literature between 2022 and 2025."

First, the volume of academic output on AI in marketing has grown exponentially, creating a need to organize fragmented findings into coherent thematic clusters [cite: 10]. Second, the technological capability has evolved from *predictive* analytics (forecasting churn, sales) to *generative* capabilities (content creation, ideation), introducing new psychological dynamics such as the \"uncanny valley\" in customer service and \"hallucinations\" in data analysis [cite: 1, 11]. Third, there is a pressing need to bridge the gap between the \"black box\" predictive power of algorithms and the explanatory power of psychological theory [cite: 12, 13]."
