This systematic literature review synthesizes perspectives from two dominant yet distinct fields: psychology, which traditionally emphasizes internal mechanisms, personality, and adaptation; and public health, which focuses on social determinants, population-level interventions, and policy outcomes. By integrating the \"hedonic treadmill\" and set-point theories of psychology with the socio-ecological models of public health, this review highlights the convergence of these disciplines in the era of \"Wellbeing Budgets\" and digital phenotyping. We identify a critical transition from relying solely on self-reports to incorporating biomarkers and passive sensing, and we argue that a transdisciplinary framework is essential for addressing the \"paradox of affluence\" and designing effective mental health policies.\n\n---"

      "content": "For much of the 20th century, the progress of nations was measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the health of individuals was defined by the absence of disease. However, the last four decades have witnessed a paradigm shift toward \"Subjective Well-Being\" (SWB) as a primary indicator of human flourishing. This shift was crystallized by the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission, which argued that economic metrics alone are insufficient for measuring societal progress [cite: 1, 2].\n\nThe study of SWB is currently bifurcated into two primary disciplinary streams. **Psychology** has historically viewed SWB as a construct rooted in individual personality, cognitive evaluation, and emotional regulation, often focusing on the stability of happiness levels despite life events (the \"hedonic treadmill\") [cite: 3, 4]. Conversely, **Public Health** views SWB as an outcome of environmental conditions, social equity, and access to resources, treating it as a vital sign of societal health that can be influenced by policy interventions [cite: 5, 6].\n\nThis review aims to bridge these perspectives. By analyzing over 100 key sources, we examine how SWB is defined, measured, and applied across these disciplines. We explore the historical milestones that legitimized SWB research, the current state-of-the-art in measurement (including digital phenotyping and biomarkers), and the practical application of these concepts in national policies, such as New Zealand’s Wellbeing Budget.\n\n---"

Psychological scales like Ryff’s Scales of Psychological Well-Being measure autonomy, mastery, and purpose rather than just \"feeling good\" [cite: 9, 10].\n\nPublic health increasingly incorporates both, recognizing that \"flourishing\" requires both feeling happy (hedonic) and functioning well (eudaimonic) [cite: 10, 11]."

Public health provides the macroscopic view, revealing how societal structures, environment, and policy create the conditions for flourishing.\n\nThe literature demonstrates that SWB is no longer a \"soft\" science. With the advent of biomarkers, digital phenotyping, and robust psychometrics, it has become a quantifiable metric capable of guiding national budgets and health systems. However, the field must overcome the challenges of self-report bias and disciplinary fragmentation. The future of SWB lies in a unified approach where psychological insights into human nature inform public health structures, ensuring that societies are designed not just for economic growth, but for the sustained well-being of their citizens.\n\n---"
