      "content": "**Background:** Traditional assessment in child psychology and psychiatry relies heavily on retrospective questionnaires and clinical interviews, which are subject to recall bias and fail to capture the dynamic, context-dependent nature of youth psychopathology. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) offers a solution by sampling behaviors and experiences in real-time within natural environments.\n**Objectives:** This systematic review synthesizes the literature on EMA in child and adolescent mental health, building upon the foundational Annual Research Review by Russell and Gajos (2020). It aims to evaluate current methods, clinical applications, and the emerging integration of passive sensing and adaptive interventions.\n**Methods:** A comprehensive review of literature published through 2024 was conducted, focusing on EMA protocols, passive mobile sensing, and ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) in youth populations.\n**Results:** EMA has successfully characterized the temporal dynamics of internalizing disorders, ADHD, and high-risk behaviors such as non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). Recent advances include the validation of transdiagnostic models of irritability and the deployment of Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs). However, compliance rates in youth average approximately 78%, with notable declines over longer study durations.\n**Conclusions:** EMA is a feasible and rigorous methodology for elucidating the \"micro-processes\" of development and psychopathology. Future research must prioritize the integration of multi-modal data streams and the ethical implementation of real-time interventions to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice.\n\n---"

      "heading": "1. Introduction",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The field of child psychology and psychiatry has historically relied on the \"snapshot\" model of assessment—clinical evaluations or caregiver reports that aggregate behavior over weeks or months. While valuable for diagnostic classification, these methods often obscure the granular, moment-to-moment transactions between a child and their environment that drive development and psychopathology. Children’s lives are lived in moments, yet our science has traditionally measured them in months [cite: 1].\n\nEcological Momentary Assessment (EMA), also known as the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), represents a paradigm shift toward high-resolution, idiographic inquiry. By utilizing mobile technology to capture data repeatedly in daily life, EMA minimizes recall bias and maximizes ecological validity [cite: 2, 3]. This approach is particularly salient for youth, whose symptoms are often highly context-dependent and reactive to social and environmental stimuli.\n\nThis review provides a comprehensive analysis of the state of EMA research in child psychiatry. Motivated by the rapid proliferation of mobile technology and the increasing urgency of youth mental health crises, this paper updates and expands upon previous milestones, specifically the 2020 Annual Research Review by Russell and Gajos [cite: 3]. We examine the transition from observational study to intervention, highlighting the emergence of \"Just-in-Time\" support systems and the integration of passive digital phenotyping."
