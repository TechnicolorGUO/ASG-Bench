# Getting Through COVID-19: The Pandemic’s Impact on the Psychology of Sustainability, Quality of Life, and the Global Economy – A Systematic Review

**Abstract**
The COVID-19 pandemic represents a singular global event that simultaneously disrupted biological, economic, and psychological systems. This systematic literature review synthesizes research published between 2020 and 2025 to evaluate the tripartite impact of the pandemic on the psychology of sustainability, quality of life (QoL), and the global economy. While early literature (2020–2021) focused on acute shocks—such as lockdown-induced GDP contractions and temporary environmental improvements—later studies (2022–2025) reveal complex, long-term structural changes. Key findings indicate that while the "anthropopause" temporarily heightened pro-environmental awareness, the translation of this awareness into long-term sustainable behavior has been inconsistent, often hindered by "pandemic fatigue" and economic instability. Quality of life metrics show a K-shaped recovery, where vulnerable populations and healthcare workers continue to suffer from "Long COVID" sequelae and psychological distress, creating a hidden economic burden estimated at $1 trillion annually. Furthermore, the promised "Green Recovery" has seen mixed implementation, with significant gaps between policy rhetoric and the reality of fossil-fuel-intensive economic stimulus. This review identifies the critical need for an integrated "One Health" approach that treats economic resilience, psychological well-being, and environmental sustainability as inseparable variables in post-pandemic reconstruction.

## 1. Introduction

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 precipitated a global crisis that transcended public health, triggering a cascade of failures across economic supply chains, social support systems, and individual psychological resilience. The pandemic forced a re-evaluation of the "Triple Bottom Line" (TBL) of sustainability—economy, society, and environment—placing unprecedented strain on the equilibrium between these pillars [cite: 1, 2]. Early in the pandemic, scholars identified a unique intersection of effects: the immediate cessation of industrial activity led to short-term environmental recovery, yet the accompanying economic paralysis and social isolation posed severe threats to human quality of life and the global economy [cite: 3, 4].

The motivation for this review stems from the necessity to move beyond the initial acute-phase analysis and understand the enduring structural impacts of the pandemic. Seminal works, such as El Keshky et al. (2020), established the framework for understanding these interdependencies, highlighting how the psychology of sustainability is intrinsic to economic and social recovery [cite: 3, 4]. However, as the world transitions from the acute phase to the endemic phase (2023–2025), new variables have emerged, most notably the chronic economic burden of "Long COVID" and the divergent outcomes of "Green Recovery" stimulus packages [cite: 5, 6].

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive systematic review of the literature concerning the nexus of the psychology of sustainability, QoL, and the global economy. The objectives are to: (1) analyze the evolution of pro-environmental behaviors and the psychology of sustainability amidst crisis; (2) evaluate the longitudinal impacts on global quality of life, with specific attention to mental health and Long COVID; (3) assess the efficacy of economic recovery strategies in promoting sustainability; and (4) identify research gaps to guide future policy and scholarship.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

To ensure clarity, the following core concepts are defined as they appear in the reviewed literature:

### 2.1 The Psychology of Sustainability
Unlike traditional environmental psychology, which often focuses on the physical environment's effect on humans, the **psychology of sustainability** emphasizes the psychological processes—emotions, values, and motivations—that underpin sustainable development and well-being. It views sustainability not as a constraint but as a method to enhance quality of life [cite: 3, 7]. It encompasses "inner sustainability" (personal well-being) as a prerequisite for "outer sustainability" (ecological preservation) [cite: 7].

### 2.2 Quality of Life (QoL) and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)
**Quality of Life** is a multidimensional construct encompassing physical health, psychological state, level of independence, social relationships, and relationship to salient features of the environment [cite: 8, 9]. **HRQoL** specifically refers to the functional effect of an illness and its consequent therapy upon a patient. During the pandemic, these metrics were heavily influenced by factors such as job security, social isolation, and the direct physiological impacts of the virus [cite: 10, 11].

### 2.3 Green Recovery
**Green Recovery** refers to economic stimulus packages and policy measures adopted post-pandemic that aim to reinvigorate the economy while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation. It is often framed as "building back better," utilizing the crisis as an opportunity to transition away from fossil-fuel dependence [cite: 12, 13].

### 2.4 Long COVID (Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2)
**Long COVID** is defined as the continuation or development of new symptoms 3 months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with these symptoms lasting for at least 2 months with no other explanation. It has emerged as a significant variable in both QoL and economic productivity analysis due to its debilitating effect on the workforce [cite: 14, 15].

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

The literature reveals a distinct chronological evolution in how these topics were addressed.

### 3.1 Phase I: The "Anthropopause" and Acute Shock (2020)
The initial phase was characterized by the "anthropopause"—a global reduction in human mobility and economic activity. Research from this period highlighted a paradox: while the global economy contracted by approximately 3-5% and unemployment surged [cite: 16, 17], environmental indicators improved. Nitrogen dioxide levels dropped significantly in industrial zones, and carbon emissions saw a record temporary decrease [cite: 18, 19]. Psychologically, this phase was marked by collective trauma, fear, and a sudden disruption of social fabrics, leading to immediate declines in QoL [cite: 20, 21].

### 3.2 Phase II: Adaptation and the "Green Recovery" Rhetoric (2021–2022)
As vaccination programs rolled out, the focus shifted to recovery. The concept of "Green Recovery" gained prominence in academic and policy circles, with organizations like the OECD and IEA advocating for sustainable stimulus packages [cite: 6, 12]. However, literature from this period began to document a "rebound effect," where economic urgency often overrode sustainability goals. Psychologically, "pandemic fatigue" set in, creating barriers to pro-environmental behaviors as the public prioritized immediate health and financial security over long-term ecological concerns [cite: 22, 23].

### 3.3 Phase III: Structural Shifts and Long-Term Consequences (2023–2025)
The current phase of research focuses on the enduring scars and structural changes. The economic discourse is now dominated by the costs of Long COVID, estimated at $1 trillion annually due to lost productivity and healthcare costs [cite: 5, 15]. QoL studies have shifted from acute anxiety to chronic burnout and the long-term impacts of social isolation on the elderly and youth [cite: 24, 25]. The "Green Recovery" is now being evaluated retrospectively, with mixed results regarding its success in decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation [cite: 26, 27].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

The review identified several methodological approaches prevalent in the literature:

### 4.1 Systematic and Umbrella Reviews
Given the explosion of COVID-19 literature, **umbrella reviews** (reviews of systematic reviews) have become essential. For instance, recent umbrella reviews have synthesized evidence across hundreds of primary studies to map the global impact on QoL, identifying sociodemographic disparities that single studies often miss [cite: 24, 25, 28].

### 4.2 Econometric Modeling of Health Shocks
Researchers have employed advanced econometric models to quantify the "hidden" costs of the pandemic. This includes calculating **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** lost not just to death, but to chronic disability from Long COVID. Studies have utilized clustering approaches to categorize countries based on their mitigation strategies and economic resilience, revealing that countries with robust social safety nets generally maintained higher QoL despite economic contractions [cite: 10, 16].

### 4.3 Psychometric Analysis of Sustainability
To measure the psychology of sustainability, researchers have adapted tools like the **Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)** and the **Protection Motivation Theory** to the pandemic context. These models attempt to explain why the heightened awareness of nature during lockdowns did (or did not) translate into permanent pro-environmental behavior changes [cite: 29, 30].

### 4.4 Longitudinal Cohort Studies
Longitudinal data has been crucial for distinguishing between transient shocks and permanent changes. For example, the Australian MS Longitudinal Study provided rare natural experiment data on the impact of lockdowns on vulnerable populations, tracking Health State Utilities (HSU) over time to quantify the specific "disutility" of lockdown measures [cite: 31, 32].

## 5. Applications and Case Studies

### 5.1 The Psychology of Sustainability: Awareness vs. Action
The pandemic served as a global behavioral experiment. Research indicates that the "psychology of sustainability" was activated through a heightened sense of connectedness with nature during lockdowns [cite: 19, 33]. However, this did not uniformly translate into action.
*   **Case Study (Pro-environmental Behavior):** A study on online shopping habits revealed that while environmental awareness increased, the "behavioral cost" of sustainable actions (e.g., avoiding single-use plastics) became too high for many during the crisis. The convenience of plastic-wrapped goods for hygiene purposes overrode environmental values, leading to a surge in plastic waste [cite: 29, 30].
*   **Case Study (Green Recovery Participation):** Participatory interventions in Germany showed that individuals with high pre-existing "personal ecological norms" were more resilient to pandemic disruptions and more likely to support green recovery policies, whereas those with lower baseline norms reverted quickly to unsustainable habits [cite: 19].

### 5.2 Quality of Life: A K-Shaped Impact
The impact on QoL was deeply unequal, often described as K-shaped, where some demographics recovered quickly while others faced long-term decline.
*   **Healthcare Workers:** Systematic reviews consistently identify healthcare professionals as the most severely affected group, with high rates of burnout, PTSD, and reduced HRQoL persisting years after the acute phase [cite: 34, 35].
*   **Vulnerable Populations:** Older adults experienced a "double burden" of high physiological risk and severe social isolation, leading to sharp declines in mental well-being [cite: 24, 28]. Conversely, younger adults faced significant economic anxiety and disruption to education, which manifested as long-term reductions in life satisfaction [cite: 11, 36].
*   **Long COVID:** Recent longitudinal studies (2024–2025) highlight that individuals with Long COVID report significantly lower HRQoL scores (e.g., 0.81 utility score vs. 0.85 pre-COVID), with fatigue and cognitive dysfunction acting as primary drivers of reduced well-being [cite: 37, 38].

### 5.3 The Global Economy: Resilience and the Green Stimulus
*   **Developing Economies:** A case study of the "Green Recovery" in Vietnam and India highlights the tension between immediate economic survival and long-term sustainability. While "Green Recovery" frameworks were proposed to aid forest and farm producer organizations, the lack of immediate capital and infrastructure often forced a return to traditional, less sustainable economic practices [cite: 13, 39].
*   **Renewable Energy Transition:** In OECD countries, the pandemic accelerated the shift toward renewables, not merely for environmental reasons but for economic resilience. The volatility of fossil fuel prices during the pandemic underscored the economic security benefits of renewable energy, leading to accelerated adoption in countries like Germany and Denmark [cite: 26, 40]. However, global analysis suggests that only a small fraction (approx. 3-5%) of total COVID-19 stimulus funds were effectively allocated to "green" initiatives, limiting the potential for a transformative structural shift [cite: 41].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

### 6.1 The "Green Recovery" Implementation Gap
A major challenge identified is the gap between the rhetoric of "building back better" and the reality of fiscal policy. While the *psychology* of sustainability gained traction, the *economics* of recovery often favored incumbent industries. Fossil fuel subsidies were frequently used as quick-fix stimulus measures, locking economies into carbon-intensive pathways despite the availability of green alternatives [cite: 42, 43].

### 6.2 The Economic Burden of Long COVID
The global economy faces an unresolved challenge in the form of Long COVID. With an estimated 400 million individuals affected globally, the labor market has contracted significantly. The economic drag is estimated at 1% of global GDP ($1 trillion annually), yet most economic recovery models fail to account for this chronic reduction in human capital [cite: 5, 15]. This creates a "blind spot" in economic forecasting and sustainability planning.

### 6.3 Psychological Barriers and Pandemic Fatigue
The "finite pool of worry" hypothesis suggests that the immediate threat of the virus displaced long-term concerns about climate change. Research indicates that "pandemic fatigue" has depleted the cognitive resources necessary for pro-environmental decision-making. Overcoming this psychological barrier to re-engage the public in sustainability efforts remains a significant open problem [cite: 23, 44].

### 6.4 Data Heterogeneity and Causal Inference
Methodologically, the field struggles with the heterogeneity of data. Comparing QoL impacts across different cultures, lockdown severities, and economic systems is difficult. Furthermore, distinguishing the economic impacts of the virus itself from the impacts of mitigation measures (lockdowns) remains a complex causal inference problem [cite: 10, 45].

## 7. Future Research Directions

Based on the identified gaps, the following directions are proposed:

1.  **Integration of "One Health" Economics:** Future research must integrate public health data (specifically Long COVID morbidity) into macroeconomic sustainability models. We need to understand how chronic health issues impact the long-term viability of the "circular economy" [cite: 15, 46].
2.  **Longitudinal Behavioral Tracking:** Studies are needed to track the *persistence* of pro-environmental behaviors adopted during the pandemic. Did the "anthropopause" lead to any permanent shifts in consumption, or was it entirely transient? [cite: 1, 29].
3.  **Psychological Interventions for Sustainability:** Research should focus on developing psychological interventions that can bypass "pandemic fatigue." This involves framing sustainability not as an additional burden, but as a component of health recovery (e.g., the mental health benefits of green spaces) [cite: 19, 47].
4.  **Global South Perspectives:** There is a significant lack of data on the "Psychology of Sustainability" in low-income countries. Future reviews must address how the triple crisis (health, economy, environment) impacts the Global South differently, particularly regarding the "Green Recovery" which often assumes the fiscal capacity of the Global North [cite: 26, 48].

## 8. Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic was a watershed moment that exposed the fragility of the global economic and social order. This systematic review demonstrates that the pandemic's impact was not merely a temporary shock but a catalyst for structural changes in the psychology of sustainability, quality of life, and the global economy.

The literature confirms that while the pandemic initially raised awareness of environmental issues (Psychology of Sustainability), the translation of this awareness into action has been obstructed by economic instability and psychological fatigue. Quality of Life has suffered a sustained blow, particularly through the mechanism of Long COVID, which now acts as a significant drag on the Global Economy. The "Green Recovery," while theoretically sound, has faced significant implementation challenges, often sidelined by the urgency of immediate economic stabilization.

Ultimately, "getting through" COVID-19 requires acknowledging that these three domains are inextricably linked. A sustainable global economy cannot exist without a healthy workforce (QoL), and a healthy workforce depends on a sustainable environment. The path forward lies in policies that do not treat these as competing interests but as a unified ecosystem of human and planetary health.
