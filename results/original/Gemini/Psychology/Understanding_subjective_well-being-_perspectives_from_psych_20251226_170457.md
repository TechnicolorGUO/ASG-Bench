# Bridging the Divide: A Systematic Review of Subjective Well-Being from Psychological and Public Health Perspectives

**Abstract**
Subjective well-being (SWB)—colloquially termed "happiness"—has evolved from a philosophical ideal into a rigorous metric for assessing individual and societal progress. This systematic literature review synthesizes perspectives from two dominant yet distinct fields: psychology, which traditionally emphasizes internal mechanisms, personality, and adaptation; and public health, which focuses on social determinants, population-level interventions, and policy outcomes. By integrating the "hedonic treadmill" and set-point theories of psychology with the socio-ecological models of public health, this review highlights the convergence of these disciplines in the era of "Wellbeing Budgets" and digital phenotyping. We identify a critical transition from relying solely on self-reports to incorporating biomarkers and passive sensing, and we argue that a transdisciplinary framework is essential for addressing the "paradox of affluence" and designing effective mental health policies.

## 1. Introduction

For much of the 20th century, the progress of nations was measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the health of individuals was defined by the absence of disease. However, the last four decades have witnessed a paradigm shift toward "Subjective Well-Being" (SWB) as a primary indicator of human flourishing. This shift was crystallized by the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission, which argued that economic metrics alone are insufficient for measuring societal progress [cite: 1, 2].

The study of SWB is currently bifurcated into two primary disciplinary streams. **Psychology** has historically viewed SWB as a construct rooted in individual personality, cognitive evaluation, and emotional regulation, often focusing on the stability of happiness levels despite life events (the "hedonic treadmill") [cite: 3, 4]. Conversely, **Public Health** views SWB as an outcome of environmental conditions, social equity, and access to resources, treating it as a vital sign of societal health that can be influenced by policy interventions [cite: 5, 6].

This review aims to bridge these perspectives. By analyzing over 100 key sources, we examine how SWB is defined, measured, and applied across these disciplines. We explore the historical milestones that legitimized SWB research, the current state-of-the-art in measurement (including digital phenotyping and biomarkers), and the practical application of these concepts in national policies, such as New Zealand’s Wellbeing Budget.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

To understand the literature, one must first distinguish between the overlapping terminologies used in psychology and public health.

### 2.1 The Tripartite Model of Subjective Well-Being
In psychology, the consensus definition, established largely by Ed Diener, posits that SWB is not a single entity but a tripartite structure consisting of:
1.  **Positive Affect (PA):** The frequency of pleasant emotions (joy, contentment).
2.  **Negative Affect (NA):** The frequency of unpleasant emotions (sadness, anxiety).
3.  **Cognitive Evaluation:** A global assessment of life satisfaction [cite: 5, 7, 8].

Crucially, these components are distinct; a person can have high life satisfaction while experiencing high stress (high NA), a common profile in high-functioning professionals [cite: 8].

### 2.2 Hedonic vs. Eudaimonic Well-Being
The literature is divided into two philosophical traditions:
*   **Hedonic Well-Being (HWB):** Focuses on happiness, pleasure attainment, and pain avoidance. This aligns closely with Diener’s SWB model [cite: 9].
*   **Eudaimonic Well-Being (EWB):** Rooted in Aristotelian philosophy, this focuses on meaning, purpose, self-realization, and functioning. Psychological scales like Ryff’s Scales of Psychological Well-Being measure autonomy, mastery, and purpose rather than just "feeling good" [cite: 9, 10].

Public health increasingly incorporates both, recognizing that "flourishing" requires both feeling happy (hedonic) and functioning well (eudaimonic) [cite: 10, 11].

### 2.3 The Public Health Perspective
In public health, SWB is often operationalized as a "health asset." It is viewed not just as a mental state but as a predictor of longevity and physical health. High SWB is associated with stronger immune systems, better cardiovascular health, and lower mortality [cite: 7, 12]. Public health frameworks tend to emphasize the *social determinants* of SWB—income, housing, and social capital—rather than the internal cognitive processes emphasized in psychology [cite: 6].

---

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

The trajectory of SWB research illustrates a move from the fringe to the center of policy.

### 3.1 Early Foundations (1920s–1970s)
While philosophers debated the "good life" for centuries, empirical measurement began in the 1920s with studies on marital success and mood [cite: 13]. The "Social Indicators Movement" of the 1960s and 70s attempted to monitor society using data beyond the economy, but it lacked a cohesive theory of subjective experience [cite: 13].

### 3.2 The Psychological Turn (1984–2000)
Ed Diener’s seminal 1984 article, "Subjective Well-Being," provided the theoretical structure (the tripartite model) that allowed for standardized measurement [cite: 5, 8]. During this period, psychology focused heavily on the **Hedonic Treadmill** theory proposed by Brickman and Campbell (1971), which suggested that individuals adapt to almost any life event (e.g., winning the lottery or becoming paraplegic), returning to a genetic "set point" of happiness [cite: 3, 14]. This theory initially discouraged public health interventions, as it implied that policy changes would have only transient effects on happiness.

### 3.3 The Policy Turn (2009–Present)
The pivotal moment for public health and policy was the 2009 **Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission** report, commissioned by the French government. The report concluded that GDP was an inadequate measure of societal progress and recommended that statistical offices worldwide collect data on SWB [cite: 1, 2]. This led to the OECD Guidelines on Measuring Subjective Well-Being (2013) and the inclusion of SWB metrics in national surveys in the UK (ONS) and New Zealand [cite: 15, 16, 17].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

The measurement of SWB has expanded from simple questionnaires to complex biological and digital assessments.

### 4.1 Psychometric Scales
Self-report remains the gold standard in both disciplines due to cost-effectiveness and scalability.
*   **Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS):** A 5-item scale used globally to measure the cognitive component of SWB [cite: 8, 18].
*   **WHO-5 Well-Being Index:** Widely used in public health, this 5-item scale focuses on positive affect over the last two weeks. Recent validation studies across 43 countries suggest it has high measurement invariance, making it suitable for cross-cultural comparison, particularly in adolescents [cite: 19, 20, 21].

### 4.2 Biomarkers and Neuroimaging
To address the subjectivity of self-reports, researchers have identified biological correlates of SWB:
*   **Cortisol:** Hair and salivary cortisol levels are used as biomarkers for chronic stress (low SWB). Dysregulated diurnal cortisol patterns are linked to loneliness and poor cognitive function [cite: 22, 23].
*   **Neuroimaging:** fMRI studies link Eudaimonic well-being to the default mode network and frontoparietal networks. Higher SWB is associated with reduced amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli, suggesting a neural basis for emotional resilience [cite: 22, 24].

### 4.3 Digital Phenotyping
The most significant recent methodological advance is **digital phenotyping**—the "moment-by-moment quantification of the individual-level human phenotype in situ using data from smartphones" [cite: 25, 26].
*   **Passive Sensing:** GPS data (mobility), call logs (social interaction), and accelerometer data (physical activity) correlate with depression and SWB. For example, reduced mobility and fewer outgoing calls are predictive of lower SWB [cite: 25, 27].
*   **Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA):** Instead of retrospective surveys ("How did you feel last month?"), apps prompt users to report their mood multiple times a day. This reduces recall bias and captures the dynamic nature of SWB [cite: 28, 29].

## 5. Applications and Case Studies

The divergence between psychology and public health is most visible in how SWB data is applied.

### 5.1 Psychological Applications: Adaptation and Resilience
Psychological research applies SWB to understand individual resilience. The **Hedonic Treadmill** theory has been revised; evidence now shows that while people adapt to marriage or moderate income changes, they do *not* fully adapt to severe negative events like unemployment, chronic disability, or the death of a spouse [cite: 30, 31, 32]. This "soft" adaptation theory suggests that interventions *can* permanently raise SWB if they target non-adaptable domains (e.g., social connections rather than material goods) [cite: 3].

### 5.2 Public Health Policy: The New Zealand Wellbeing Budget
New Zealand provides the premier case study of integrating SWB into public health policy. In 2019, the government introduced the "Wellbeing Budget," which requires all new spending proposals to demonstrate their impact on five wellbeing priorities, including mental health and child poverty, rather than just economic ROI [cite: 17, 33].
*   **Impact:** The budget explicitly uses life satisfaction data to guide resource allocation. For instance, recognizing that mental health is a key driver of low SWB, the budget allocated significant funds to frontline mental health services, moving beyond the traditional focus on acute psychiatric care [cite: 34, 35].

### 5.3 The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS)
The UK ONS measures national well-being across 10 domains, including "Personal Well-being" (SWB). This data has been used to evaluate policy impacts, such as the cost-effectiveness of mental health interventions (e.g., Improving Access to Psychological Therapies) and the value of green spaces [cite: 15, 36].

### 5.4 Interventions: Green Space and Mindfulness
Public health reviews have quantified the impact of environmental and behavioral interventions:
*   **Green Spaces:** Access to nature is consistently linked to higher SWB and lower cortisol, with "green prescriptions" now being used as a therapeutic tool [cite: 37].
*   **Mindfulness:** Large-scale trials indicate that mindfulness interventions can improve SWB in healthy workers, bridging the gap between individual psychological practice and population health [cite: 38, 39].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

Despite progress, the field faces significant hurdles in validity and theoretical unity.

### 6.1 Self-Report Bias and Validity
A major criticism from the "hard" sciences is the reliance on self-reports. Responses can be distorted by **social desirability bias** (wanting to appear happy), current mood, and cultural norms [cite: 40, 41]. For example, "happiness" may be interpreted differently in individualistic vs. collectivistic cultures, complicating international rankings [cite: 42, 43]. While biomarkers offer objectivity, they lack the specificity of subjective feelings (e.g., cortisol measures stress, not "dissatisfaction") [cite: 12].

### 6.2 The Disciplinary Divide
Das et al. (2020) highlight a lack of a unified theoretical framework. Psychology focuses on *internal* regulation (personality, coping), while public health focuses on *external* factors (infrastructure, SES). This leads to disjointed research where psychologists might suggest "gratitude journaling" for a population that public health researchers argue needs "better housing" [cite: 6].

### 6.3 Measurement Invariance
Ensuring that a score of "7/10" on a life satisfaction scale means the same thing in Finland as it does in Togo is a persistent challenge. Although tools like the WHO-5 show promise, strict measurement invariance is rarely achieved across diverse global populations, threatening the validity of international policy comparisons [cite: 19, 44].

---

## 7. Future Research Directions

To advance the field, research must move toward transdisciplinary integration.

### 7.1 Integrating Digital Phenotyping with Policy
Future research should explore how real-time digital phenotyping can inform public health policy. Instead of waiting for annual survey results, policymakers could theoretically monitor aggregate SWB fluctuations in response to events (e.g., a pandemic or economic crash) using anonymized passive sensing data [cite: 26, 45].

### 7.2 Precision Public Health
Combining psychological profiling with public health interventions could lead to "precision well-being." For example, individuals with high neuroticism (a psychological trait) might benefit more from mindfulness interventions, while those with low social capital might benefit more from community infrastructure projects. Understanding these interactions requires large-scale longitudinal studies combining genomic, digital, and survey data [cite: 38, 46].

### 7.3 Beyond the Hedonic Treadmill
Research must further clarify the limits of adaptation. Identifying exactly *which* public health interventions yield lasting changes in SWB—versus those to which people quickly adapt—is crucial for cost-effective policymaking. This requires long-term follow-up studies on policy interventions like the Universal Basic Income or housing guarantees [cite: 3, 47].

---

## 8. Conclusion

Understanding subjective well-being requires a dual lens. Psychology provides the microscopic view, revealing the internal cognitive and emotional machinery that dictates how individuals process their lives. Public health provides the macroscopic view, revealing how societal structures, environment, and policy create the conditions for flourishing.

The literature demonstrates that SWB is no longer a "soft" science. With the advent of biomarkers, digital phenotyping, and robust psychometrics, it has become a quantifiable metric capable of guiding national budgets and health systems. However, the field must overcome the challenges of self-report bias and disciplinary fragmentation. The future of SWB lies in a unified approach where psychological insights into human nature inform public health structures, ensuring that societies are designed not just for economic growth, but for the sustained well-being of their citizens.
