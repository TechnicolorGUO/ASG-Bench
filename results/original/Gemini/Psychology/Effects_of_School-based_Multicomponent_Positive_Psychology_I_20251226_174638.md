# Effects of School-based Multicomponent Positive Psychology Interventions on Well-being and Distress in Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis

**Key Points**
*   **Efficacy:** Multicomponent Positive Psychology Interventions (MPPIs) demonstrate small but significant positive effects on subjective and psychological well-being, as well as reductions in depression and anxiety among adolescents.
*   **Methodology:** The most effective programs utilize a "whole-school" approach (e.g., Geelong Grammar School model) or structured curricula (e.g., Maytiv, Penn Resiliency Program) targeting multiple components like gratitude, strengths, and emotional regulation.
*   **Critical Limitations:** The field faces challenges regarding implementation fidelity, "fade-out" effects where benefits diminish over time, and valid critiques regarding cultural bias and the neoliberal focus on individual responsibility for happiness.
*   **Future Directions:** Research must pivot toward longitudinal studies, component analysis (identifying *which* parts work best), and cross-cultural validations to address the "WEIRD" (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) bias in current data.

## Abstract

**Background:** In response to rising rates of adolescent psychological distress, schools have increasingly adopted Positive Psychology Interventions (PPIs). While early interventions focused on single constructs (e.g., gratitude journals), recent trends favor multicomponent interventions (MPPIs) that target multiple domains of flourishing simultaneously.
**Objective:** This paper provides a comprehensive systematic literature review of school-based MPPIs, evaluating their effectiveness in promoting well-being and reducing distress (depression, anxiety, stress) in adolescents.
**Methods:** A synthesis of existing meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and theoretical critiques was conducted. Key programs such as the Penn Resiliency Program, the Maytiv Program, and the Geelong Grammar School model were examined.
**Results:** Evidence indicates that MPPIs yield small to moderate effect sizes for enhancing subjective well-being ($g \approx 0.24$) and reducing depressive symptoms ($g \approx 0.28$). Programs integrated into the curriculum and delivered by trained teachers generally show better sustainability than isolated workshops.
**Conclusion:** MPPIs represent a promising, proactive mental health strategy in education. However, the field must address significant heterogeneity in study quality, implementation barriers, and valid sociological critiques regarding the "happiness industry" to mature into a robust pedagogical standard.

## 1. Introduction

The mental health of adolescents has become a global public health priority. Epidemiological data suggests a rising prevalence of internalizing disorders, such as anxiety and depression, among youth [cite: 1, 2]. Traditionally, school-based mental health initiatives operated under a "deficit model," prioritizing the identification and treatment of pathology. However, the emergence of **Positive Psychology** in the late 1990s prompted a paradigm shift toward a "strengths-based model," focusing on the cultivation of competencies that enable individuals to flourish rather than merely survive [cite: 1, 3].

This shift gave rise to **Positive Education**, defined as education for both traditional academic skills and happiness [cite: 3]. Within this framework, **Multicomponent Positive Psychology Interventions (MPPIs)** have emerged as a state-of-the-art approach. Unlike single-component interventions (SCIs) that target a specific trait (e.g., optimism), MPPIs integrate various exercises targeting multiple theoretical components of well-being—such as positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment (PERMA)—into a cohesive program [cite: 4, 5].

The motivation for this review stems from the need to critically evaluate the efficacy of these complex interventions. While individual studies report success, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have highlighted variability in outcomes, often dependent on study quality, duration, and delivery method [cite: 6, 7]. Furthermore, as the field matures, it faces scrutiny regarding cultural applicability and the potential for toxic positivity [cite: 8, 9]. This paper aims to synthesize current evidence, analyze key case studies, and discuss the structural challenges facing the implementation of MPPIs in secondary education.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

To understand the scope of MPPIs, it is necessary to define the theoretical constructs that underpin them.

### 2.1 Positive Psychology and Positive Education
Positive psychology is the scientific study of the strengths and virtues that enable individuals and communities to thrive [cite: 1, 10]. **Positive Education** applies these principles in school settings. It is not merely a curriculum addition but often a pedagogical philosophy that views well-being as a synergistic partner to academic achievement [cite: 3, 11].

### 2.2 Multicomponent Interventions (MPPIs)
An MPPI is defined as a program that targets two or more theoretically relevant well-being components through a variety of exercises [cite: 4, 12]. The rationale is that a multifaceted approach decreases the risk of boredom (hedonic adaptation), increases the probability of "spill-over" effects between domains, and allows students to identify the specific strategies that resonate with their personal "happiness profile" [cite: 4].

### 2.3 The PERMA Model
Developed by Martin Seligman, the PERMA model is the theoretical backbone of many MPPIs. It posits five pillars of well-being:
*   **P**ositive Emotions: Experiencing joy, hope, and gratitude.
*   **E**ngagement: Psychological flow and absorption in activities.
*   **R**elationships: Authentic social connections.
*   **M**eaning: Purpose beyond the self.
*   **A**ccomplishment: Pursuit and mastery of goals [cite: 5, 13, 14].

### 2.4 The Dual-Factor Model of Mental Health
MPPIs often operate on the **Dual-Factor Model**, which posits that mental health is not merely the absence of psychopathology. A student can be free of depression yet still languish (low well-being). Conversely, a student may experience symptoms of distress while possessing pockets of high well-being. MPPIs aim to simultaneously reduce distress (pathogenic focus) and increase flourishing (salutogenic focus) [cite: 12].

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

The integration of well-being into education has deep roots, but its formalization is recent.

### 3.1 Pre-2000: Humanistic Roots
The foundations of positive education lie in **Humanistic Psychology** (mid-20th century), with figures like Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers emphasizing self-actualization and the "fully functioning person" [cite: 15, 16]. Early educational theorists like John Dewey also advocated for education that addressed the "whole child," though these approaches lacked the specific empirical interventions of modern positive psychology [cite: 17].

### 3.2 1998–2009: The Birth of Positive Psychology
In 1998, Martin Seligman used his presidency of the American Psychological Association to launch Positive Psychology. A critical milestone was the collaboration between Seligman and **Geelong Grammar School (GGS)** in Australia (2008), which attempted the first whole-school implementation of positive psychology. This project demonstrated that well-being skills could be explicitly taught and embedded in a school's culture [cite: 3, 18].

### 3.3 2010–Present: The Rise of Multicomponent Evidence
The last decade has seen a shift from efficacy trials of single interventions (e.g., "three good things") to large-scale RCTs of multicomponent curricula. Systematic reviews, such as those by Waters (2011) and Tejada-Gallardo et al. (2020), have begun to consolidate the evidence base, moving the field from "promising" to "evidence-based" [cite: 2, 6].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

Contemporary MPPIs utilize diverse methodologies to engage adolescents. These interventions are typically delivered in group formats within classrooms, often by teachers who have undergone specialized training [cite: 1].

### 4.1 Curriculum-Based Approaches
Most MPPIs are structured as curricula consisting of 6 to 20+ sessions.
*   **Cognitive Restructuring:** Adapted from CBT, helping students identify "thinking traps" and dispute pessimistic explanations [cite: 19, 20].
*   **Character Strengths:** Using the VIA Classification to identify "signature strengths" and applying them in new ways to solve problems [cite: 21].
*   **Gratitude and Savoring:** Journaling exercises and "savoring" positive moments to boost positive affect [cite: 13, 14].
*   **Mindfulness:** Breathing and attention regulation exercises to enhance engagement and reduce stress [cite: 22, 23].

### 4.2 Whole-School Approaches
State-of-the-art implementation goes beyond a standalone class. The **Geelong Grammar School Model** utilizes a four-stage process:
1.  **Learn It:** Staff and students learn the science of well-being.
2.  **Live It:** Staff model the behaviors (crucial for authenticity).
3.  **Teach It:** Explicit curriculum delivery.
4.  **Embed It:** Policies and school culture (e.g., how discipline is handled) reflect positive principles [cite: 18, 24].

### 4.3 Network Analysis and Profiling
Recent methodological advances include using **Network Analysis** to understand how well-being components interact. For example, studies have shown that MPPIs can reorganize the network structure of mental health, making emotional well-being more negatively associated with depression and stress, effectively creating a stronger "buffer" against pathology [cite: 12]. Additionally, **Latent Profile Analysis** helps identify student subgroups (e.g., "Ambivalents" vs. "Optimists") to tailor interventions [cite: 25, 26].

---

## 5. Applications and Case Studies

Several prominent programs illustrate the application of MPPIs in diverse cultural contexts.

### 5.1 The Penn Resiliency Program (PRP)
Developed at the University of Pennsylvania, the PRP is one of the most widely evaluated interventions. It combines cognitive-behavioral skills with positive psychology.
*   **Focus:** Resilience, optimistic explanatory style, and problem-solving.
*   **Evidence:** Over 20 controlled studies indicate PRP reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety. The "train-the-trainer" model is central, where teachers receive intensive instruction to deliver the curriculum [cite: 19, 20, 27].

### 5.2 The Maytiv Program (Israel)
The Maytiv ("Doing Good") program is a comprehensive MPPI based on the PERMA model, implemented in Israeli middle schools.
*   **Structure:** 15 bi-weekly sessions covering gratitude, flow, strengths, and emotional regulation.
*   **Outcomes:** A large-scale RCT ($N > 2000$) demonstrated significant increases in positive emotions, peer relations, and school engagement, alongside reductions in general distress and anxiety. Notably, it also showed positive effects on **academic achievement (GPA)**, supporting the synergy between well-being and learning [cite: 5, 28].

### 5.3 Strengths Gym
This program focuses specifically on the **VIA Character Strengths**.
*   **Method:** A three-level curriculum where students identify and "exercise" their strengths (e.g., using "Kindness" or "Bravery" in a specific weekly challenge).
*   **Outcomes:** Research indicates significant increases in life satisfaction and self-esteem. It emphasizes that fixing weaknesses is less effective than building on existing strengths [cite: 21, 29, 30].

### 5.4 Get to Know Me+ (Spain)
A targeted MPPI focusing on **Time Attitudes** (feelings toward past, present, and future).
*   **Method:** 6 sessions helping adolescents reframe negative views of the past and build optimism for the future.
*   **Outcomes:** Participants transitioned from "Negative" profiles to "Optimistic" profiles, with sustained improvements in subjective well-being [cite: 25, 26, 31].

## 6. Critical Analysis: Strengths and Weaknesses

### 6.1 Efficacy: What the Meta-Analyses Say
A landmark systematic review and meta-analysis by **Tejada-Gallardo et al. (2020)** synthesized data from 9 trials ($N=4,898$). The findings revealed:
*   **Subjective Well-being:** Small significant effect ($g = 0.24$).
*   **Psychological Well-being:** Small significant effect ($g = 0.25$).
*   **Depression Symptoms:** Small significant reduction ($g = 0.28$).
*   **Anxiety/Stress:** Results were less consistent, though some studies show reductions [cite: 4, 6, 7].

These effect sizes, while "small" statistically, are comparable to other universal public health interventions and are meaningful given the scalability of school-based programs [cite: 32].

### 6.2 Strengths of the Field
*   **Dual Impact:** MPPIs are unique in their ability to simultaneously promote flourishing and prevent pathology [cite: 4, 12].
*   **Accessibility:** Schools provide a universal platform, reducing barriers to mental health support such as cost and stigmatization [cite: 33].
*   **Academic Synergy:** Evidence from programs like Maytiv suggests that well-being interventions do not detract from academics but may enhance them by improving engagement [cite: 5, 28].

### 6.3 Weaknesses and Limitations
*   **Heterogeneity:** Studies vary wildly in quality. Removing low-quality studies often alters effect sizes (e.g., increasing effects for depression but decreasing for subjective well-being) [cite: 4, 6].
*   **Fade-Out Effects:** While some effects are sustained, others, particularly for anxiety, tend to fade without "booster sessions" or continued practice [cite: 34, 35].
*   **Sample Bias:** A significant portion of research is conducted in Western, educated contexts (the WEIRD problem), limiting generalizability to non-Western or low-income populations [cite: 5].

## 7. Challenges and Open Problems

Despite progress, the field faces substantial hurdles.

### 7.1 Implementation Fidelity and Teacher Burden
The success of an MPPI is heavily dependent on the deliverer. Interventions delivered by trained teachers are often effective, but teachers are already overburdened. "Curriculum crowding" and lack of resources are cited as primary barriers [cite: 10, 36]. If teachers view the program as "just another task" rather than a cultural shift, fidelity drops, and results suffer [cite: 23, 37].

### 7.2 The "Happycracy" and Cultural Critique
Sociologists like **Cabanas and Illouz** have critiqued the "happiness industry" and positive education for promoting a neoliberal agenda. They argue that by framing happiness as a personal choice and a result of "skills," these programs:
*   Pathologize negative emotions (which are natural responses to adversity).
*   Shift responsibility for well-being entirely onto the individual, ignoring structural factors like poverty, inequality, or systemic discrimination.
*   Create "psytizens" who are constantly self-monitoring and feel guilty for not being happy [cite: 8, 9, 38, 39].
This critique is particularly relevant when applying MPPIs in disadvantaged schools without addressing the students' material realities.

### 7.3 Cultural Bias in Interventions
Many MPPIs (e.g., PBIS) have been criticized for being "culturally neutral" in theory but culturally biased in practice. For example, behavioral expectations in schools often align with dominant cultural norms, potentially alienating minority students. There is a pressing need for **Culturally Responsive Positive Behavior Interventions (CRPBIS)** that validate diverse cultural expressions of well-being [cite: 40, 41, 42].

---

## 8. Future Research Directions

To advance the field, future research should prioritize:

1.  **Component Analysis:** We know *that* MPPIs work, but we do not always know *why*. Research must dismantle these programs to identify which specific components (e.g., is it the gratitude journal or the strengths identification?) drive the effects [cite: 1].
2.  **Longitudinal Sustainability:** Studies need longer follow-up periods (1–5 years) to assess the durability of effects and the necessity of booster sessions [cite: 1, 31].
3.  **Teacher Well-being:** Interventions should target *teacher* well-being first. Teachers who flourish are better equipped to model these skills for students, potentially mediating the intervention's success [cite: 1, 37].
4.  **Cross-Cultural Validation:** Rigorous RCTs are needed in non-Western and low-income contexts to test the universality of PERMA and other constructs [cite: 5].
5.  **Integration with Technology:** Exploring the efficacy of digital or app-based MPPIs to improve adherence and provide personalized feedback [cite: 32].

---

## 9. Conclusion

The systematic review of School-based Multicomponent Positive Psychology Interventions reveals a field that has transitioned from nascent enthusiasm to empirical validation. The evidence suggests that MPPIs are a viable, effective strategy for enhancing adolescent well-being and reducing distress, with small but robust effect sizes across various cultural contexts. Programs like the Penn Resiliency Program and Maytiv demonstrate that when well-being is taught with the same rigor as mathematics—and when it is embedded in the school culture rather than treated as a peripheral workshop—it can yield significant benefits for the "whole child."

However, the field must reckon with valid critiques regarding implementation sustainability and the potential for cultural insensitivity. The next generation of positive education must move beyond a "one-size-fits-all" approach toward culturally responsive, structurally aware, and teacher-supported models. By doing so, schools can fulfill their dual mandate: cultivating not only successful students but also flourishing human beings.
