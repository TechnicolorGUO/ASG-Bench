# Updating Goal-Setting Theory in Physical Activity Promotion: A Critical Conceptual Review

**Key Points**
*   **Paradigm Shift:** Traditional goal-setting practices in physical activity (PA), particularly the use of SMART goals and specific performance targets (e.g., "10,000 steps"), are increasingly criticized for lacking theoretical nuance and potentially discouraging inactive individuals.
*   **The "Update":** Modern Goal-Setting Theory (GST) has evolved to distinguish between **performance goals** (focus on outcomes) and **learning goals** (focus on strategy/skill acquisition). Recent literature proposes a third category: **open goals** (exploratory, non-specific targets).
*   **Context Matters:** Evidence suggests that while specific performance goals benefit already active individuals, they may induce pressure and failure in beginners. Conversely, open goals ("see how well you can do") and learning goals appear to foster higher intrinsic motivation, flow states, and adherence among the insufficiently active.
*   **Future Directions:** The field is moving toward "context-dependent" goal setting, where the type of goal is matched to the individual's stage of behavior change, moving away from a "one-size-fits-all" approach.

## Abstract

**Title:** Updating Goal-Setting Theory in Physical Activity Promotion: A Critical Conceptual Review

**Abstract:**
Goal setting is a ubiquitous behavior change technique in physical activity (PA) promotion, predominantly guided by Locke and Latham’s Goal-Setting Theory (GST) and the SMART acronym. However, recent empirical and conceptual developments suggest that the application of GST in public health has become oversimplified, often failing to account for the complexity of behavior change in inactive populations. This review critically examines the state of the art in goal-setting for PA, highlighting the divergence between traditional "performance goals" and emerging concepts such as "learning goals" and "open goals." We synthesize evidence indicating that while specific, challenging goals optimize performance for those with established skills, they may be detrimental to PA initiation. Conversely, open goals (e.g., "see how high you can get your step count") and learning goals facilitate autonomy, reduce psychological pressure, and promote flow states. We conclude by proposing an updated, context-sensitive framework for goal setting that prioritizes the psychological experience of the user, offering a roadmap for future research and intervention design.

## 1. Introduction

Physical inactivity remains a leading risk factor for non-communicable diseases globally. To address this, practitioners and public health officials rely heavily on behavioral interventions, with goal setting being one of the most widely accepted strategies [cite: 1, 2]. The theoretical foundation for these interventions is almost exclusively derived from Locke and Latham’s Goal-Setting Theory (GST), which posits that specific, challenging goals lead to higher performance than easy or vague goals [cite: 1, 3].

This theoretical axiom has been translated into public health practice through the widespread use of the SMART acronym (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-bound) and rigid targets, such as the 10,000-step daily mandate [cite: 4, 5]. However, a growing body of literature suggests that this "one-size-fits-all" application of GST may be fundamentally flawed when applied to the complex behavioral challenge of PA adoption [cite: 1, 6].

The motivation for this review stems from recent calls to "update" the application of GST in PA promotion. Emerging evidence indicates that for insufficiently active individuals—who lack the skills, efficacy, or habit strength for exercise—specific performance goals may trigger anxiety, perceptions of failure, and disengagement [cite: 7, 8]. This paper aims to synthesize these critiques, define the emerging typologies of goals (Performance vs. Learning vs. Open), and present a modernized framework for goal setting that aligns with contemporary psychological evidence.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

To understand the proposed updates to the field, it is necessary to distinguish between the different goal typologies now recognized in the literature.

### 2.1 Performance Goals
Performance goals are the traditional focus of GST. They focus on a specific outcome or standard of proficiency.
*   **Definition:** A goal that frames the focus on a specific task outcome.
*   **Example:** "Walk 10,000 steps today" or "Run 5km in 30 minutes" [cite: 9, 10].
*   **Mechanism:** These work by directing attention, mobilizing effort, and encouraging persistence, but they assume the individual already possesses the necessary ability and commitment [cite: 3].

### 2.2 Learning Goals
Learning goals shift focus from the *outcome* to the *process* of knowledge acquisition.
*   **Definition:** A goal that directs attention toward the discovery of strategies, processes, or procedures necessary to master a task.
*   **Example:** "Identify three different times in my day where I can fit in a 10-minute walk" or "Learn the proper technique for a squat" [cite: 3, 11].
*   **Utility:** GST theorists (Seijts & Latham) suggest these are superior to performance goals when a task is novel or complex, as they prevent "tunnel vision" on the outcome at the expense of skill development [cite: 3, 12].

### 2.3 Open Goals
Open goals represent a significant departure from the "specificity" requirement of traditional GST.
*   **Definition:** Nonspecific, exploratory goals that are phrased to encourage "seeing how well one can do."
*   **Example:** "See how many steps I can reach today" or "See how far I can walk in 10 minutes" [cite: 7, 13].
*   **Attributes:** They are exploratory, possess measurable parameters (allowing for feedback), but produce graded outcomes rather than a binary pass/fail state [cite: 13].

### 2.4 The SMART Acronym
SMART is a heuristic used to guide goal setting, typically standing for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound. Despite its popularity, recent critical reviews argue it lacks a solid theoretical basis in the context of PA and is often conflated with GST despite distinct differences [cite: 4, 5, 14].

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

### 3.1 The Industrial-Organizational Origins (1990)
Locke and Latham formally presented GST in 1990, primarily based on research in industrial-organizational psychology. The core finding was that specific, challenging goals led to higher performance than "do your best" goals [cite: 1, 3]. This finding was robust in workplace settings where tasks were often straightforward and participants were paid employees.

### 3.2 The Translation to Physical Activity (1990s–2010s)
Public health and sport psychology adopted GST, assuming the "specific and challenging" principle applied equally to health behaviors. This era saw the rise of rigid guidelines (e.g., 150 minutes/week) and the dominance of SMART goals in clinical counseling [cite: 1, 5].

### 3.3 The "Learning Goal" Evolution (2000s)
In the early 2000s, Locke, Latham, and Seijts updated the original theory to account for complex tasks. They found that when people lack the requisite skills, specific performance goals can actually *impair* performance. They introduced "learning goals" as the solution [cite: 3, 12]. However, this nuance was largely overlooked in PA promotion, which continued to rely on performance metrics [cite: 1].

### 3.4 The Critical Turn (2016–Present)
A pivotal meta-analysis by McEwan et al. (2016) challenged the status quo. Analyzing 52 interventions, they found that vague goals (e.g., "be more active") were statistically just as effective as specific goals for increasing PA [cite: 3, 15, 16]. This contradicted the central tenet of GST as applied to PA.

Subsequently, Swann and colleagues (2020, 2021, 2022) began publishing a series of critical reviews and experimental studies proposing "Open Goals" and critiquing the "overuse" of SMART goals, effectively launching the current "update" phase of the theory [cite: 1, 4, 7].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

The current state of the art is moving away from rigid specificity toward **context-dependent goal setting**. This approach posits that the "best" goal depends on the individual's activity status (active vs. inactive).

### 4.1 Critique of the SMART Framework
Recent comprehensive reviews have identified significant flaws in the SMART approach for PA promotion:
*   **Lack of Theory:** The acronym is not based on scientific theory and contains redundancies (e.g., Achievable and Realistic are often synonymous) [cite: 4, 5].
*   **Inconsistency:** It does not specify *what type* of goal to set (learning vs. performance).
*   **Potential Harm:** For inactive individuals, SMART goals highlight the gap between current reality and the target, potentially inducing "failure" states if the specific target is missed (e.g., hitting 9,000 steps instead of 10,000 is perceived as failure) [cite: 6, 7].

### 4.2 The Open Goal Approach
Open goals are currently the most innovative technique in the field. They function by reframing the exercise experience:
*   **Psychological Mechanism:** Open goals appear to facilitate **Flow States** (absorption in the activity) and reduce pressure. By removing the binary "pass/fail" ceiling, individuals focus on the process rather than the outcome [cite: 13, 17].
*   **Graded Success:** Unlike specific goals, open goals allow for success at any level of effort. "Seeing how well I can do" implies that any activity is a data point of success, rather than a deficit from a target [cite: 7, 13].
*   **Autonomy:** Open goals are inherently autonomy-supportive, allowing the individual to determine their limit in the moment, which aligns with Self-Determination Theory [cite: 13, 18].

### 4.3 The Learning Goal Approach
For those new to exercise, state-of-the-art interventions now incorporate learning goals to build self-efficacy.
*   **Technique:** Instead of setting a target for weight loss or distance, practitioners set targets for *strategy generation*.
*   **Application:** "This week, your goal is to experiment with three different walking routes to see which one you enjoy most." This builds the "resources" moderator required for later performance goals [cite: 3, 12].

## 5. Applications and Case Studies

### 5.1 Experimental Evidence: The 6-Minute Walk Test
Several studies have utilized the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) to compare goal types in controlled settings.
*   **Hawkins et al. (2020):** This study compared active and insufficiently active adults.
    *   *Finding:* Insufficiently active participants walked significantly further and reported higher enjoyment/pleasure with **Open Goals** compared to SMART goals.
    *   *Contrast:* Active participants preferred and performed better with SMART goals. This confirms the "context-dependent" hypothesis [cite: 8, 19, 20, 21].
*   **Swann et al. (2020):** Found that open goals resulted in higher interest in repeating the exercise session compared to SMART goals, suggesting better potential for long-term adherence [cite: 9, 19].

### 5.2 Clinical and Rehabilitation Settings
In rehabilitation, where patients often face new physical limitations, rigid performance goals can be demoralizing.
*   **Wade (Clinical Rehabilitation):** Argues that goals in rehab should not necessarily be SMART. The complexity of recovery requires goals that accommodate uncertainty—a perfect fit for Open or Learning goals [cite: 4].
*   **Michaux (Lifestyle Medicine):** Advocates for using learning goals (e.g., "identify methods to increase steps") for patients with low self-efficacy, reserving performance goals for those with established confidence [cite: 12].

### 5.3 The "Open to Move" Pilot Trial
Goddard et al. (2025) conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a 6-week walking program.
*   **Design:** Compared Open Goals vs. Specific Goals vs. Control.
*   **Results:** Open goals were feasible and led to similar physical activity increases as specific goals but with **more positive psychological experiences** (enjoyment, reduced pressure).
*   **Implication:** This provides the first ecological evidence that open goals work in real-world, longitudinal interventions, not just single lab sessions [cite: 22, 23, 24].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

Despite the promise of updating GST, several challenges remain.

### 6.1 Measurement and Quantification
Specific goals (e.g., 10,000 steps) are easy to track and gamify. Open goals ("see how well you can do") are harder to quantify in terms of "completion."
*   *Problem:* How do apps and trackers reward an open goal? If there is no "ding" of completion, does the dopamine loop fail?
*   *Response:* Current research suggests the "reference point" shifts. In open goals, the reference point is the *start* (0 steps), so every step feels like a gain. In specific goals, the reference point is the *target* (10k), so every step prior feels like a loss/deficit [cite: 7].

### 6.2 The "Vague Goal" Paradox
Critics might argue that Open Goals are simply "do your best" (DYB) goals, which original GST deemed ineffective.
*   *Distinction:* Recent research argues Open Goals are *not* DYB goals. DYB goals are passive; Open Goals are active and exploratory. However, distinguishing these concepts in large-scale public health messaging is a communication challenge [cite: 9, 13].

### 6.3 Transitioning Between Goal Types
If Open/Learning goals are best for beginners and Performance goals are best for experts, when does the switch happen?
*   *The Gap:* There is currently no empirical data on the optimal "tipping point" or timeline for transitioning a client from open to specific goals [cite: 8, 13].

### 6.4 Cultural Entrenchment
The SMART acronym and specific targets are deeply embedded in corporate, educational, and clinical culture. Displacing a mnemonic that has been used for 40 years requires substantial re-education of the workforce [cite: 4, 5].

## 7. Future Research Directions

To fully update GST for physical activity, the following research avenues are critical:

### 7.1 Longitudinal Randomized Controlled Trials
While Goddard et al. (2025) provided pilot data, large-scale, long-term RCTs are needed to see if the psychological benefits of open goals (enjoyment) translate to sustained behavior change over 6-12 months [cite: 22, 23].

### 7.2 Mechanisms of Action
Research should further isolate *why* open goals work.
*   **Flow:** More neurophysiological studies are needed to link open goals to flow states [cite: 18].
*   **Affect:** Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) could track real-time mood changes during exercise with different goal types.

### 7.3 Moderators of Efficacy
Who benefits most?
*   **Neurodivergence:** How do individuals with ADHD or autism respond to open vs. rigid goals?
*   **Personality:** Do those with high "Need for Closure" struggle with open goals?
*   **Demographics:** Initial data suggests inactive people benefit most, but what about older adults or those with chronic conditions? [cite: 13].

### 7.4 Digital Interventions
Integrating open goal logic into wearable technology. Can an Apple Watch or Fitbit be programmed to support "Open Goal" days where the user is encouraged to explore rather than hit a ring? [cite: 25, 26].

## 8. Conclusion

The application of Goal-Setting Theory in physical activity promotion is undergoing a necessary and critical update. The historical reliance on specific, challenging performance goals (typified by the SMART acronym) appears to be a "square peg in a round hole" for the majority of the population who are insufficiently active.

The literature reviewed here supports a **context-dependent framework**:
1.  **For Active Individuals:** Specific **Performance Goals** remain effective. They provide direction and challenge for those with the skills and commitment to achieve them.
2.  **For Inactive/Beginner Individuals:** **Open Goals** and **Learning Goals** are superior. They reduce the psychological burden of failure, enhance enjoyment through autonomy and flow, and focus on skill acquisition rather than arbitrary metrics.

Updating goal-setting theory does not mean abandoning specific goals; rather, it means expanding the toolkit. By recognizing that "seeing how well you can do" is a valid and scientifically supported strategy, practitioners can better support the millions of individuals for whom traditional goal setting has failed.
