Recent literature proposes a third category: **open goals** (exploratory, non-specific targets).\n*   **Context Matters:** Evidence suggests that while specific performance goals benefit already active individuals, they may induce pressure and failure in beginners. Conversely, open goals (\"see how well you can do\") and learning goals appear to foster higher intrinsic motivation, flow states, and adherence among the insufficiently active.\n*   **Future Directions:** The field is moving toward \"context-dependent\" goal setting, where the type of goal is matched to the individual's stage of behavior change, moving away from a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach.\n\n***"

However, recent empirical and conceptual developments suggest that the application of GST in public health has become oversimplified, often failing to account for the complexity of behavior change in inactive populations. This review critically examines the state of the art in goal-setting for PA, highlighting the divergence between traditional \"performance goals\" and emerging concepts such as \"learning goals\" and \"open goals.\" We synthesize evidence indicating that while specific, challenging goals optimize performance for those with established skills, they may be detrimental to PA initiation. Conversely, open goals (e.g., \"see how high you can get your step count\") and learning goals facilitate autonomy, reduce psychological pressure, and promote flow states. We conclude by proposing an updated, context-sensitive framework for goal setting that prioritizes the psychological experience of the user, offering a roadmap for future research and intervention design.\n\n***"

      "content": "Physical inactivity remains a leading risk factor for non-communicable diseases globally. To address this, practitioners and public health officials rely heavily on behavioral interventions, with goal setting being one of the most widely accepted strategies [cite: 1, 2]. The theoretical foundation for these interventions is almost exclusively derived from Locke and Latham’s Goal-Setting Theory (GST), which posits that specific, challenging goals lead to higher performance than easy or vague goals [cite: 1, 3].\n\nThis theoretical axiom has been translated into public health practice through the widespread use of the SMART acronym (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-bound) and rigid targets, such as the 10,000-step daily mandate [cite: 4, 5]. However, a growing body of literature suggests that this \"one-size-fits-all\" application of GST may be fundamentally flawed when applied to the complex behavioral challenge of PA adoption [cite: 1, 6].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from recent calls to \"update\" the application of GST in PA promotion. Emerging evidence indicates that for insufficiently active individuals—who lack the skills, efficacy, or habit strength for exercise—specific performance goals may trigger anxiety, perceptions of failure, and disengagement [cite: 7, 8]. This paper aims to synthesize these critiques, define the emerging typologies of goals (Performance vs. Learning vs. Open), and present a modernized framework for goal setting that aligns with contemporary psychological evidence."

They provide direction and challenge for those with the skills and commitment to achieve them.\n2.  **For Inactive/Beginner Individuals:** **Open Goals** and **Learning Goals** are superior. They reduce the psychological burden of failure, enhance enjoyment through autonomy and flow, and focus on skill acquisition rather than arbitrary metrics.\n\nUpdating goal-setting theory does not mean abandoning specific goals; rather, it means expanding the toolkit. By recognizing that \"seeing how well you can do\" is a valid and scientifically supported strategy, practitioners can better support the millions of individuals for whom traditional goal setting has failed.\n\n***"
