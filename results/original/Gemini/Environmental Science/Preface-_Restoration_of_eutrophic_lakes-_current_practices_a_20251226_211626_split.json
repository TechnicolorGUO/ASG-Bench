This systematic literature review synthesizes the current state of lake restoration science, anchored in the themes presented in the seminal preface by Jilbert et al. (2020). We critically evaluate the evolution of restoration techniques from early wastewater diversion and hydraulic interventions to modern geo-engineering and integrated ecosystem management. The review categorizes interventions into external load reduction, physical engineering, chemical inactivation, and biological manipulation, providing a comparative analysis of their efficacy, longevity, and cost-effectiveness. Special attention is given to the \"climate penalty\"—the phenomenon where warming temperatures counteract restoration efforts—and the persistent challenge of internal phosphorus loading. Through detailed case studies, including Lake Washington, Lake Trummen, and Lake Taihu, we illustrate the disparity between restoration success in deep, stratified systems versus shallow, polymictic lakes. The paper concludes by identifying future research directions, emphasizing the necessity of Integrated Lake Basin Management (ILBM), the potential of emerging nanobubble technologies, and the critical need for quantitative models that account for climate-nutrient interactions.\n\n---"

      "content": "Freshwater ecosystems provide essential services, including drinking water, irrigation, fisheries, and recreation. However, the integrity of these systems is increasingly compromised by eutrophication—the excessive enrichment of water bodies with minerals and nutrients, primarily nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) [cite: 1, 2]. This process, accelerated by urbanization, industrialization, and agricultural intensification, shifts lakes from clear, oligotrophic states to turbid, eutrophic states characterized by harmful algal blooms (HABs), hypoxia, and biodiversity loss [cite: 2, 3].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the urgent need to consolidate knowledge on restoration efficacy. As noted by Jilbert et al. (2020), while traditional methods like aeration and chemical inactivation remain prevalent, the field is witnessing a divergence: the popularity of biomanipulation is declining, while research into novel in-lake nutrient inactivation methods is expanding [cite: 1, 2]. Furthermore, the \"climate penalty\" poses a new existential threat to restoration success, requiring a re-evaluation of established targets and techniques [cite: 4, 5]."
