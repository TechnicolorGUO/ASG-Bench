# Per‐ and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Thermal Destruction at Water Resource Recovery Facilities: A State of the Science Review

**Key Points**
*   **Urgency of Destruction:** Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs) are passive receivers of PFAS but act as major concentrators of these chemicals in sewage sludge. With increasing restrictions on land application, thermal destruction is becoming a critical management strategy.
*   **Technology Maturity:** Incineration is the most mature technology but faces scrutiny regarding incomplete combustion and air emissions. Emerging technologies like Pyrolysis, Gasification, and Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO) offer promising alternatives with potentially higher destruction efficiencies or resource recovery benefits.
*   **The "Incomplete" Challenge:** A primary scientific gap is the formation of Products of Incomplete Combustion (PICs). While parent PFAS compounds are often removed from the solid phase, they may transform into volatile, shorter-chain fluorinated compounds emitted in exhaust gases if not properly managed.
*   **Regulatory Evolution:** The U.S. EPA's 2024 updated interim guidance and the introduction of Other Test Method 50 (OTM-50) mark a significant shift toward more rigorous monitoring of volatile fluorinated compounds in thermal emissions.

## Abstract

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of anthropogenic chemicals characterized by their extreme persistence and resistance to degradation, primarily due to the strength of the carbon-fluorine (C–F) bond. Water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) serve as central collection points for PFAS-laden wastewater, where these contaminants partition significantly into sewage sludge. As regulations restrict the land application of biosolids, thermal destruction technologies have emerged as the primary alternative for permanent PFAS management. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the state of the science regarding thermal destruction of PFAS at WRRFs. We evaluate established technologies, such as Sewage Sludge Incinerators (SSIs), and emerging methods, including pyrolysis, gasification, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), and supercritical water oxidation (SCWO). The review synthesizes current literature on destruction mechanisms, removal efficiencies, and the formation of products of incomplete combustion (PICs). While high-temperature incineration (>1000°C) theoretically achieves mineralization, operational realities in SSIs often fall short, necessitating advanced emission controls. Emerging technologies like SCWO demonstrate destruction efficiencies exceeding 99.9%, though commercial scalability remains a hurdle. The paper concludes by identifying critical research gaps, particularly regarding the fate of volatile organofluorine byproducts and the validation of new stack testing methodologies (OTM-50).

## 1. Introduction

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been manufactured and used globally since the 1940s in a vast array of industrial and consumer products, including firefighting foams (AFFF), non-stick cookware, and water-resistant textiles [cite: 1, 2]. Often termed "forever chemicals," PFAS are defined by their perfluoroalkyl moiety, where carbon atoms are fully fluorinated, creating a C–F bond that is one of the strongest in organic chemistry [cite: 3, 4]. This stability, while industrially useful, renders PFAS recalcitrant to traditional environmental degradation pathways.

Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs) are not producers of PFAS but act as passive receivers and concentrators. PFAS enter WRRFs through domestic sewage, industrial discharges, and landfill leachate [cite: 5, 6]. Conventional wastewater treatment processes, such as activated sludge, are generally ineffective at degrading PFAS. Instead, these compounds tend to partition: short-chain PFAS largely remain in the aqueous effluent discharged to surface waters, while long-chain PFAS preferentially partition into the sewage sludge (biosolids) [cite: 7, 8, 9].

Historically, the management of sewage sludge has relied heavily on land application as a fertilizer, which recycles nutrients. However, the discovery of PFAS contamination in agricultural soils and groundwater linked to biosolids has precipitated a regulatory crisis [cite: 5, 10]. With bans on land application emerging in jurisdictions like Maine, WRRFs are urgently seeking alternative disposal methods [cite: 5]. Thermal destruction offers the potential to break the PFAS cycle by mineralizing these compounds. However, the efficacy of thermal treatment is a subject of intense scientific debate, centering on whether these processes completely destroy the molecule or merely transform it into volatile, potentially toxic byproducts [cite: 11, 12].

This paper reviews the current scientific understanding of PFAS thermal destruction within the context of municipal wastewater treatment, evaluating the efficacy, mechanisms, and environmental safety of various thermal technologies.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

### 2.1. PFAS Chemistry and Thermal Stability
The thermal destruction of PFAS requires sufficient energy to cleave the C–F bond (bond energy ~485 kJ/mol) [cite: 13]. Complete destruction, or **mineralization**, converts PFAS into inorganic fluoride (HF), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and water. Incomplete destruction can lead to **transformation**, where precursor compounds (e.g., fluorotelomers) oxidize into terminal PFAAs (e.g., PFOA, PFOS) or fragment into shorter-chain volatile organic fluorine compounds [cite: 10, 14].

### 2.2. Thermal Treatment Categories
*   **Incineration:** Combustion in an oxygen-rich environment at temperatures typically between 700°C and 1000°C for SSIs. The goal is volume reduction and pathogen destruction [cite: 12, 15].
*   **Pyrolysis:** Thermal decomposition in an oxygen-free (or very low oxygen) environment, typically at 400°C–800°C. This process produces biochar, bio-oil, and syngas [cite: 16, 17].
*   **Gasification:** Thermal conversion in a distinct oxygen-limited environment (sub-stoichiometric), generating a combustible syngas and ash/char [cite: 16, 18].
*   **Hydrothermal Technologies (HTL/SCWO):** Processing in an aqueous medium at elevated temperature and pressure. SCWO operates above the critical point of water (374°C, 22.1 MPa), acting as a solvent that dissolves organics and oxygen for rapid oxidation [cite: 19, 20].

### 2.3. Destruction and Removal Efficiency (DRE)
DRE is a regulatory metric calculated by measuring the mass of a specific contaminant entering the system versus the mass emitted in the stack gas. A DRE of 99.99% is a standard benchmark for hazardous waste. However, DRE does not account for the formation of PICs or the partitioning of PFAS into ash or scrubber water, making it an incomplete metric for total environmental impact [cite: 14, 21].

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

The concern regarding PFAS in biosolids is a relatively recent phenomenon compared to the chemical's production history.

*   **Early 2000s:** Initial detection of PFOS and PFOA in environmental matrices and sewage sludge led to the first global surveys [cite: 1, 22].
*   **2010s:** Research established that conventional biological treatment does not degrade PFAS and may increase PFAA concentrations through precursor transformation [cite: 7].
*   **2020:** The U.S. EPA released its first *Interim Guidance on the Destruction and Disposal of PFAS*, identifying thermal treatment as a potential solution but highlighting significant data gaps regarding PICs [cite: 23, 24].
*   **2021:** Winchell et al. published a seminal "State of the Science" review, concluding that while incineration offers a pathway for destruction, the fate of PFAS in WRRF incinerators was largely unclear [cite: 11, 12].
*   **2024:** The EPA updated its Interim Guidance, introducing a new technology evaluation framework. Concurrently, the release of **OTM-50** (Other Test Method 50) provided a standardized method for measuring volatile fluorinated compounds in air emissions, addressing a critical analytical gap [cite: 25, 26].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

### 4.1. Sewage Sludge Incineration (SSI)
Incineration is the most established thermal technology at WRRFs. In North America, over 100 SSIs are in operation, primarily utilizing Multiple Hearth Furnaces (MHF) or Fluidized Bed Furnaces (FBF) [cite: 12, 15].

*   **Operational Parameters:** FBFs generally operate at more uniform and higher temperatures (>800°C) compared to MHFs, which have temperature gradients. Complete mineralization of PFAS is generally cited to require temperatures >1000°C for 1–2 seconds, conditions rarely met by standard SSIs [cite: 10, 11].
*   **Fate of PFAS:** Studies indicate that SSIs effectively remove PFAS from the solid ash residue. However, the primary concern is the transfer of PFAS to the gas phase. A 2024 study on full-scale SSIs found that while the ash was largely free of PFAS, the stack emissions contained short-chain PFAS and volatile alkanes, representing 0.5%–4.5% of greenhouse gas emissions [cite: 27, 28].
*   **Limitations:** The formation of HF causes refractory corrosion, and the potential for emitting PICs remains the primary regulatory hurdle [cite: 4, 29].

### 4.2. Pyrolysis and Gasification
These technologies are gaining traction as alternatives that produce value-added products (biochar/energy) while potentially destroying PFAS.

*   **Pyrolysis:** Operating at 500°C–800°C, pyrolysis has been shown to remove >90% of PFAS from the solid biochar phase [cite: 10, 30, 31]. The PFAS are volatilized into the syngas/off-gas.
*   **Integrated Systems:** The viability of pyrolysis depends on the treatment of the off-gas. Systems coupling pyrolysis with a high-temperature thermal oxidizer (operating >1000°C) have demonstrated overall system removal efficiencies of >99% [cite: 32].
*   **Biochar Safety:** Several studies, including those on commercial systems like Bioforcetech, report that PFAS are non-detectable in the resulting biochar, suggesting it may be safe for land application, although long-term leaching studies are ongoing [cite: 30, 33, 34].

### 4.3. Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO)
SCWO is considered a "high-efficiency" destruction technology. By bringing water to a supercritical state, it dissolves organic compounds and oxygen, allowing for rapid, homogenous oxidation.

*   **Efficiency:** SCWO has demonstrated >99.9% destruction of PFAS in sewage sludge and AFFF, often reducing concentrations to non-detect levels [cite: 19, 20, 35].
*   **Mechanism:** The process occurs in the liquid phase (though supercritical), preventing the formation of typical combustion byproducts like NOx and SOx. Fluorine is converted to inorganic fluoride salts in the effluent water [cite: 20].
*   **Status:** While highly effective, SCWO is energy-intensive and currently transitioning from pilot to commercial scale (e.g., 374Water, Hazen and Sawyer pilots) [cite: 19, 36].

### 4.4. Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL)
HTL converts wet biomass into biocrude oil at moderate temperatures (250°C–350°C) and high pressures.

*   **PFAS Fate:** Research indicates partial degradation of PFAS during HTL. Some studies show >99% transformation of carboxylic PFAS (PFCAs) but limited degradation of sulfonic PFAS (PFSAs) like PFOS [cite: 37, 38].
*   **Partitioning:** A significant portion of undegraded PFAS partitions into the aqueous phase or the biocrude, necessitating further treatment of these streams [cite: 37, 39].

## 5. Mechanisms of Thermal Destruction

Understanding the chemical pathways of destruction is vital for optimizing treatment.

### 5.1. C–F Bond Cleavage and Mineralization
The primary goal is breaking the C–F bond. In oxidative environments (incineration/SCWO), this occurs via radical attack (e.g., H•, OH•) at high temperatures. The degradation often follows a stepwise defluorination, stripping CF₂ units from the chain [cite: 3, 40].

### 5.2. Hydrodefluorination (HDF)
In reductive environments (pyrolysis), the mechanism shifts toward hydrodefluorination, where hydrogen replaces fluorine on the carbon chain. This pathway is influenced by the presence of calcium or other alkali metals in the sludge matrix, which can act as reactants to form stable metal fluorides (e.g., CaF₂), effectively "trapping" the fluorine in the solid phase [cite: 14, 41, 42].

### 5.3. Role of Co-Contaminants
Sewage sludge is a complex matrix. The presence of calcium (Ca) has been shown to enhance defluorination by lowering the energy barrier for C–F bond cleavage and promoting the formation of inorganic fluoride salts [cite: 41, 42]. Conversely, high moisture content can increase HF formation in the gas phase [cite: 41].

## 6. Applications and Case Studies

### 6.1. Silicon Valley Clean Water (Pyrolysis)
A pilot study utilizing the Bioforcetech pyrolysis system at Silicon Valley Clean Water demonstrated the potential of this technology. The system processed biosolids at ~600°C. Results indicated that target PFAS were removed from the biochar to non-detect levels. The study emphasized the importance of the thermal oxidizer in destroying the volatilized PFAS in the off-gas [cite: 33, 43].

### 6.2. Full-Scale SSI Studies (MHF vs. FBF)
A comparative study of a Multiple Hearth Furnace and a Fluidized Bed Furnace revealed distinct differences. The FBF showed better destruction potential due to uniform heating, whereas the MHF emitted detectable short-chain PFAS in the stack gas. The study highlighted that while mass flows of PFAS were reduced, "destruction" was often incomplete, resulting in the emission of volatile fluorinated organics [cite: 27, 28].

### 6.3. 374Water AirSCWO Pilot
In a demonstration at a facility in Kokomo, Indiana, an SCWO unit treated sewage sludge. The process reduced solid mass by >95% and achieved >99% elimination of identifiable PFAS, converting the organic matter into water, CO₂, and inert minerals [cite: 19].

## 7. Challenges and Open Problems

### 7.1. Products of Incomplete Combustion (PICs)
The most significant scientific gap is the identification of PICs. Standard targeted analysis (e.g., EPA Method 1633) looks for specific PFAS compounds. However, thermal treatment may generate ultra-short-chain fluorocarbons (e.g., CF₄, C₂F₆) or other volatile fluorinated compounds not captured by standard lists. These compounds are potent greenhouse gases and their toxicity is often unknown [cite: 10, 14, 21, 27].

### 7.2. Air Emissions Measurement
Until recently, measuring PFAS in stack gas was notoriously difficult. The EPA's release of **OTM-50** in 2024 addresses this by targeting volatile fluorinated compounds. However, widespread implementation and validation of this method at full-scale facilities are still in early stages [cite: 26, 44, 45].

### 7.3. Infrastructure and Corrosion
The formation of Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) during PFAS destruction poses a severe corrosion risk to the refractory lining and metal shells of incinerators and thermal oxidizers. This necessitates expensive materials (e.g., high-alumina bricks) and frequent maintenance [cite: 29, 46].

### 7.4. Energy and Cost
High-temperature incineration and SCWO are energy-intensive. While pyrolysis and gasification offer energy recovery potential (syngas), the capital costs for retrofitting WRRFs with these advanced thermal units are significant [cite: 47, 48].

## 8. Future Research Directions

*   **Non-Targeted Analysis (NTA):** Future studies must move beyond targeted PFAS lists to employ NTA and Total Organic Fluorine (TOF) mass balances. This is essential to confirm that PFAS are truly mineralized and not just transformed into unknown fluorinated byproducts [cite: 12, 49].
*   **Full-Scale OTM-50 Validation:** Rigorous field testing of SSIs and pyrolysis units using OTM-50 is needed to quantify the emission of volatile PICs and establish true destruction efficiencies [cite: 26, 50].
*   **Mechanistic Optimization:** Research should focus on optimizing operating conditions (temperature, residence time, turbulence) and additives (e.g., calcium, alkaline reagents) to maximize mineralization and minimize HF emissions [cite: 41, 42].
*   **Fate of Fluorine:** A complete mass balance of fluorine—tracking it from sludge to ash, scrubber water, and stack gas—is required to validate destruction claims definitively [cite: 41, 51].

## 9. Conclusion

Thermal destruction represents the most viable pathway for managing the growing volume of PFAS-contaminated biosolids, particularly as land application becomes legally untenable. The science has advanced significantly, moving from a basic understanding of PFAS presence to complex evaluations of thermal degradation mechanisms.

Current evidence suggests that while conventional Sewage Sludge Incinerators can achieve significant PFAS removal from solids, they carry a risk of emitting volatile transformation products if not operated at sufficiently high temperatures with robust off-gas treatment. Emerging technologies like Pyrolysis and SCWO offer higher destruction efficiencies and the potential for resource recovery, but they require further validation at commercial scales.

The release of the EPA's 2024 guidance and OTM-50 marks a turning point, shifting the focus from simple removal to comprehensive destruction verification. The future of PFAS management at WRRFs lies in the integration of these advanced thermal technologies with rigorous emissions monitoring, ensuring that the solution to water pollution does not become a source of air pollution.
