As the volume of ecological data expands, the need for rigorous statistical integration to inform policy and conservation has never been greater.\n**Objectives:** This systematic literature review aims to synthesize the current state of meta-analytic practice in environmental sciences, focusing on the transition from traditional models to multilevel frameworks. It critically evaluates methodologies for meta-regression, heterogeneity quantification, and publication bias testing.\n**Methods:** A comprehensive review of methodological guidelines, historical milestones, and contemporary applications was conducted. Key sources include seminal works on ecological meta-analysis and recent proposals for reporting standards such as PRISMA-EcoEvo.\n**Results:** The review identifies a critical paradigm shift towards multilevel meta-analytic models that explicitly account for non-independence—a pervasive feature of ecological data (e.g., phylogenetic relatedness, multiple estimates per study). Despite this methodological maturation, current practices often lag; surveys indicate that fewer than half of environmental meta-analyses adequately report heterogeneity or assess publication bias.\n**Conclusions:** To ensure the reliability of evidence synthesis in environmental policy, researchers must adopt advanced hierarchical models and adhere to rigorous reporting guidelines. Future research should prioritize open science practices and the development of bias detection methods suitable for highly heterogeneous datasets.\n\n---"

      "content": "The field of environmental science is characterized by an explosion of primary research data, often distributed across diverse taxa, ecosystems, and experimental designs. While this accumulation of knowledge is valuable, it presents a significant challenge: how to synthesize conflicting or variable results into coherent conclusions that can guide environmental management and policy [cite: 1, 2]. Traditional narrative reviews, while useful for hypothesis generation, are often susceptible to subjectivity and \"vote-counting\" bias, where the significance of results is tallied without regard for sample size or effect magnitude [cite: 3].\n\nQuantitative evidence synthesis, primarily through systematic review and meta-analysis, offers a rigorous alternative. By statistically combining effect sizes from multiple independent studies, meta-analysis increases statistical power, improves the precision of effect estimates, and allows for the exploration of sources of variation (heterogeneity) [cite: 4, 5]. In environmental sciences, these tools are increasingly used to address pressing global issues, such as biodiversity loss, climate change impacts, and pollution risks [cite: 6, 7].\n\nHowever, the application of meta-analysis in ecology and evolution faces unique challenges compared to its origins in medicine and social sciences. Ecological data are frequently non-independent, highly heterogeneous, and subject to complex interaction effects [cite: 8, 9]. Recent surveys of the literature reveal concerning gaps in methodological rigor; for instance, a 2023 survey found that only approximately 40% of environmental meta-analyses reported heterogeneity statistics, and fewer than half assessed publication bias [cite: 5, 10].\n\nThis paper provides a comprehensive review of quantitative evidence synthesis in environmental sciences. It serves as a practical guide to the theoretical underpinnings and application of meta-analysis, meta-regression, and publication bias tests, with a specific focus on the necessity of multilevel modeling to address the complex structure of environmental data.\n\n---"
