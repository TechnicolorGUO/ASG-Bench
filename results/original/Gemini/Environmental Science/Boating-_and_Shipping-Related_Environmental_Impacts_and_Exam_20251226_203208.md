# Boating- and Shipping-Related Environmental Impacts and Example Management Measures: A Review

**Key Points**
*   **Dual Impact Sources:** The review distinguishes between commercial shipping (global scale, emissions, invasive species) and recreational boating (local scale, physical habitat destruction, antifouling toxicity).
*   **Regulatory Frameworks:** Management relies heavily on international treaties like MARPOL (Annex VI for air, Annex IV for sewage) and the Ballast Water Management Convention, though enforcement varies by jurisdiction.
*   **Technological Solutions:** Key advancements include "eco-mooring" systems to protect seagrass, alternative marine fuels (methanol, ammonia) for decarbonization, and autonomous vessel technologies to improve efficiency.
*   **Emerging Challenges:** Significant debates persist regarding the environmental trade-offs of open-loop scrubbers and the socio-economic barriers to adopting green technologies in the recreational sector.

## Abstract

Maritime transport and recreational boating are pivotal to the global economy and coastal tourism, yet they exert profound pressures on aquatic ecosystems. This systematic literature review synthesizes current research on the environmental impacts of boating and shipping, categorizing them into physical, chemical, and biological disturbances. Commercial shipping is identified as a primary driver of atmospheric pollution (NOx, SOx, and GHGs) and the translocation of invasive aquatic species via ballast water and biofouling. Conversely, recreational boating is frequently associated with localized physical damage to benthic habitats, particularly seagrass meadows, through anchoring and mooring practices, as well as chemical contamination from antifouling paints and sewage discharge. This paper critically evaluates example management measures, ranging from international regulatory frameworks like MARPOL and the IMO 2023 GHG Strategy to technological interventions such as environmentally friendly mooring systems (EFMs) and alternative fuels. Through an analysis of case studies—including the Baltic Sea SECA, the Port of Vancouver’s ECHO Program, and Mediterranean seagrass conservation—we identify the efficacy of current mitigation strategies. The review concludes by highlighting research gaps in autonomous shipping impacts, the socio-economic adoption of green technologies, and the need for holistic management approaches that bridge the commercial-recreational divide.

## 1. Introduction

The anthropogenic utilization of marine and freshwater environments for transport and leisure has grown exponentially over the last century. Shipping facilitates over 80% of global trade, serving as the backbone of the international economy [cite: 1, 2]. Simultaneously, recreational boating has surged in popularity, becoming a significant economic driver in coastal regions such as the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, and Australia [cite: 3, 4]. However, this intensification of maritime activity has come at a substantial environmental cost, necessitating a rigorous examination of the ecological footprints left by vessels of all sizes.

Research motivation for this review stems from the increasing urgency to reconcile maritime economic activities with environmental sustainability. While commercial shipping is often scrutinized for its contribution to global climate change and air quality degradation [cite: 1, 5], recreational boating exerts disproportionately high pressures on sensitive nearshore habitats, often in areas of high biodiversity value like coral reefs and seagrass meadows [cite: 4, 6].

The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature regarding:
1.  The specific environmental impacts associated with boating and shipping, organized by physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms.
2.  The evolution and effectiveness of management measures, from command-and-control regulations to voluntary technological adoption.
3.  The identification of critical research gaps and future directions for sustainable maritime operations.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

To ensure clarity, this review distinguishes between two primary categories of vessel operation, which differ in scale, regulation, and impact profile.

### 2.1 Commercial Shipping vs. Recreational Boating
**Commercial Shipping** refers to the operation of merchant vessels (tankers, bulk carriers, container ships) involved in the transport of cargo or passengers. These activities are largely regulated by international bodies such as the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Their impacts are often transboundary and global in scale [cite: 1, 7].

**Recreational Boating** encompasses the use of vessels for leisure, sports, or tourism, ranging from small personal watercraft to superyachts. These activities are typically concentrated in coastal zones, estuaries, and inland waterways. Regulation is often fragmented between local, state, and national authorities [cite: 3, 6].

### 2.2 Impact Categories
*   **Physical Impacts:** Direct mechanical disturbance to the environment. Key concepts include **benthic scouring** (damage to the seabed from anchors/chains) and **sediment resuspension** caused by propeller wash and vessel wake [cite: 6, 8].
*   **Chemical Impacts:** The introduction of pollutants into the water or air. This includes **antifouling** (biocides used to prevent marine growth), **hydrocarbons** (oil/fuel spills), **sewage** (black water), and **atmospheric emissions** (SOx, NOx, Particulate Matter) [cite: 5, 6].
*   **Biological Impacts:** The alteration of biological communities. Central to this is the transfer of **Invasive Aquatic Species (IAS)** via ballast water or hull fouling, and **underwater radiated noise (URN)**, which disrupts marine mammal communication [cite: 9, 10, 11].

---

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

The governance of maritime environmental impacts has evolved from reactive measures addressing visible pollution (oil spills) to proactive frameworks targeting invisible threats (air emissions, invasive species).

### 3.1 The MARPOL Convention (1973/1978)
The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) remains the cornerstone of marine environmental protection. Initially focused on oil (Annex I) and chemicals (Annex II), it has expanded to cover sewage (Annex IV), garbage (Annex V), and air pollution (Annex VI) [cite: 12, 13].
*   **Annex V (1988):** Introduced a complete ban on the disposal of plastics into the sea, a critical milestone for marine litter management [cite: 12].
*   **Annex VI (1997/2005):** This protocol set limits on sulfur oxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and established Emission Control Areas (ECAs), marking the industry's first major step toward air quality control [cite: 14, 15].

### 3.2 The TBT Ban (2001/2008)
Historically, tributyltin (TBT) was the dominant biocide in antifouling paints. However, its endocrine-disrupting effects on non-target species (e.g., imposex in gastropods) led to the IMO's International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships (AFS Convention). Adopted in 2001 and entering into force in 2008, this ban forced the industry to transition to copper-based and foul-release coatings [cite: 16].

### 3.3 Ballast Water Management Convention (2004/2017)
Recognizing ballast water as a primary vector for IAS, the IMO adopted the BWM Convention in 2004. Entering into force in 2017, it mandates that ships manage their ballast water to remove, render harmless, or avoid the uptake of harmful organisms, transitioning from ballast water exchange (D-1) to treatment systems (D-2) by 2024 [cite: 17, 18].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

This section reviews the specific impacts and the contemporary management measures designed to mitigate them.

### 4.1 Physical Impacts and Management
**Impacts:** Traditional block-and-chain moorings used by recreational boats scour the seabed as the vessel swings with wind and tide. This "halo effect" denudes seagrass meadows (*Posidonia oceanica*, *Zostera marina*), which are critical carbon sinks and nurseries [cite: 8, 19]. Anchoring of large commercial vessels also causes physical damage, though usually in deeper, designated anchorages.

**Management Measures:**
*   **Eco-Moorings (EFMs/AMS):** Advanced Mooring Systems (AMS) replace heavy chains with elastic rodes or floated lines that do not drag on the seabed. Helical screw anchors provide superior holding power with a minimal footprint compared to concrete blocks [cite: 20, 21]. Studies in the UK and Australia demonstrate that these systems allow seagrass recovery, though adoption is hindered by higher costs and user skepticism regarding safety [cite: 19, 22].
*   **No-Anchor Zones:** The establishment of Voluntary No-Anchor Zones (VNAZ) in sensitive habitats is a common spatial management tool, often paired with the provision of eco-moorings [cite: 22, 23].

### 4.2 Chemical Impacts and Management
**Impacts:**
*   **Air Emissions:** Shipping accounts for approximately 3% of global CO2 emissions and significant amounts of SOx and NOx [cite: 1, 24].
*   **Water Pollution:** Recreational boats often discharge grey water and untreated sewage in coastal zones, contributing to eutrophication and bacterial contamination [cite: 25, 26].

**Management Measures:**
*   **Emission Control Areas (ECAs):** Designated sea areas (e.g., Baltic Sea, North American ECA) enforce stricter limits on SOx (0.1%) and NOx emissions. The Baltic Sea SECA has resulted in an 88% reduction in SOx emissions from shipping since 2015 [cite: 27].
*   **Scrubbers:** To comply with sulfur caps, many ships installed Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (scrubbers). However, "open-loop" scrubbers discharge acidic, pollutant-laden washwater back into the sea, creating a new water quality challenge. This has led to local bans in various ports [cite: 28, 29].
*   **No Discharge Zones (NDZs):** In the US, states can designate NDZs where the discharge of both treated and untreated sewage is prohibited, requiring the use of pump-out facilities [cite: 25, 30].

### 4.3 Biological Impacts and Management
**Impacts:**
*   **Invasive Species:** Biofouling on hull niches (sea chests, thrusters) and ballast water discharge are the two main vectors for IAS [cite: 9, 31].
*   **Underwater Noise:** Propeller cavitation and machinery noise from commercial shipping overlap with the communication frequencies of marine mammals, causing stress and masking communication [cite: 11, 32].

**Management Measures:**
*   **2023 Biofouling Guidelines:** The IMO adopted revised guidelines in 2023 to minimize IAS transfer, emphasizing ship-specific Biofouling Management Plans (BMP) and record books. The guidelines introduce a fouling rating system and recommend proactive cleaning of microfouling [cite: 9, 33].
*   **Ship Quieting:** Technologies such as improved propeller design and air lubrication systems reduce noise. Operational measures like "slow steaming" have proven highly effective; a reduction in speed significantly lowers noise output and collision risk [cite: 34, 35].

## 5. Applications and Case Studies

### 5.1 The Port of Vancouver ECHO Program
The Enhancing Cetacean Habitat and Observation (ECHO) Program is a leading example of voluntary management to mitigate acoustic disturbance. Targeted at protecting the endangered Southern Resident Killer Whale, the program asks vessels to slow down or laterally displace in critical habitats (e.g., Haro Strait). Results from 2020-2023 indicate a reduction in underwater sound intensity by nearly 50% and a reduced risk of whale strikes, demonstrating the efficacy of operational adjustments [cite: 35, 36].

### 5.2 Baltic Sea SECA Implementation
The designation of the Baltic Sea as a Sulfur Emission Control Area (SECA) serves as a critical case study for regulatory success. Following the enforcement of the 0.1% sulfur limit in 2015, atmospheric measurements at the Utö station showed a 67% drop in SO2 concentrations compared to pre-SECA levels [cite: 37]. This regulation has prevented an estimated 500-1000 premature deaths annually in the region due to improved air quality [cite: 38].

### 5.3 Recreational Boating in the Mediterranean
The Mediterranean Sea, a global hotspot for nautical tourism, faces severe pressure from recreational boating. A systematic review of the region identified anchoring as a "high-risk" impact for *Posidonia oceanica* meadows. Management responses have included the installation of eco-moorings and strict protection of MPAs, yet enforcement remains a challenge due to the sheer volume of vessels [cite: 3, 4].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

### 6.1 The Scrubber Washwater Debate
A significant controversy in modern shipping management is the use of open-loop scrubbers. While they effectively reduce air emissions, they transfer pollutants to the aquatic environment. Studies show conflicting results: some suggest negligible impact in well-flushed areas [cite: 39, 40], while others indicate risks of acidification and heavy metal accumulation in ports and estuaries [cite: 28, 41]. This "pollution shifting" represents a major regulatory incoherence.

### 6.2 Socio-Economic Barriers to Eco-Mooring Adoption
Despite the proven ecological benefits of Advanced Mooring Systems (AMS), widespread adoption is slow. Barriers include high installation costs, lack of insurance approval for new designs, and boater mistrust regarding the holding capacity of elastic systems in extreme weather [cite: 22, 42]. Overcoming these barriers requires not just engineering solutions but social science interventions to change user behavior.

### 6.3 Decarbonization and Alternative Fuels
The IMO's 2023 GHG Strategy aims for net-zero emissions by 2050 [cite: 43]. However, the transition to alternative fuels like ammonia and methanol faces hurdles. Ammonia, while carbon-free, is highly toxic and poses safety risks for crew and marine life in the event of a spill [cite: 44]. Methanol is gaining traction but requires a massive scale-up in green production to be truly sustainable [cite: 45].

## 7. Future Research Directions

### 7.1 Holistic Biodiversity and Climate Management
Future research must integrate decarbonization with biodiversity protection. The "2030 Marine Biodiversity and Ocean Health Roadmap" highlights the need to assess co-benefits, such as how slowing ships for noise reduction also reduces GHG emissions [cite: 46, 47]. Research should focus on "nature-positive" shipping solutions that address the triple crisis of climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss simultaneously.

### 7.2 Autonomous Shipping
Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) promise increased efficiency and safety. However, their environmental implications are not fully understood. While they may optimize routes to reduce fuel consumption, the removal of crew could lead to new risks, such as the inability to manually respond to mechanical failures or pollution incidents. Research is needed to model the environmental risk profiles of unmanned vessels [cite: 48, 49].

### 7.3 Social Science in Recreational Boating
There is a pressing need for more social science research into recreational boater behavior. Understanding the psychological drivers of compliance (e.g., why boaters choose to anchor in seagrass despite regulations) is crucial for designing effective education and enforcement campaigns [cite: 22, 50].

## 8. Conclusion

The environmental footprint of boating and shipping is multifaceted, affecting the physical structure of seabeds, the chemical composition of water and air, and the biological integrity of marine ecosystems. This review highlights that while significant progress has been made through instruments like MARPOL Annex VI and the BWM Convention, challenges remain. The commercial sector is currently navigating a complex transition toward decarbonization, grappling with the trade-offs of transitional technologies like scrubbers and the safety of future fuels like ammonia. Simultaneously, the recreational sector faces the challenge of mitigating cumulative impacts in coastal zones, where voluntary adoption of eco-friendly technologies (e.g., AMS) often lags behind ecological necessity.

Effective management requires a paradigm shift from siloed regulations to holistic strategies that consider cross-sectoral impacts. Future success will depend on rigorous enforcement of existing regulations, the rapid maturation of green technologies, and, crucially, the engagement of stakeholders—from global shipping conglomerates to individual weekend boaters—in a shared commitment to ocean health.
