Nanotechnology, the manipulation of matter at the atomic and molecular scale (1–100 nm), has emerged as a potent frontier in environmental science, offering novel methods for remediation, monitoring, and prevention. This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive overview of the benefits and applications of environmental nanotechnology. It traces the historical evolution of the field, from Feynman’s conceptualization to the deployment of Nanoscale Zero-Valent Iron (nZVI) and the recent advent of Single-Atom Catalysts (SACs). The review critically analyzes state-of-the-art techniques, including photocatalysis using TiO2, adsorption via Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), and biogenic synthesis of nanoparticles. Furthermore, it examines specific case studies, such as the NanoRem project in Europe and US Navy field tests, to evaluate real-world efficacy. Finally, the paper addresses the critical challenges of nanotoxicity and regulatory gaps (EU REACH and US EPA TSCA), proposing future research directions toward sustainable and safe design."

Conventional remediation technologies, such as pump-and-treat systems for groundwater or incineration for solid waste, often suffer from high costs, low efficiency, and the generation of secondary pollutants [cite: 1, 2]. In this context, nanotechnology has emerged as a transformative discipline capable of addressing these limitations through the unique physicochemical properties of materials at the nanoscale.\n\nNanotechnology in environmental science, often termed \"environmental nanotechnology,\" encompasses three primary domains: **remediation** (cleaning up contaminated sites), **sensing** (monitoring pollutants), and **pollution prevention** (green chemistry and manufacturing) [cite: 1, 2]. The motivation for integrating nanotechnology lies in the enhanced reactivity, high surface-area-to-volume ratio, and tunable properties of nanomaterials (NMs), which allow for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants that are resistant to traditional treatments [cite: 3, 4].\n\nThis review aims to provide a rigorous academic overview of the field, synthesizing literature on material synthesis, application mechanisms, field-scale demonstrations, and the dichotomy between remediation benefits and potential ecotoxicological risks."

The project utilized **NANOFER 25S** (surface-stabilized nZVI) and **NANOFER STAR** (air-stable powder). The study aimed to verify migration characteristics and remedial efficiency. Results indicated successful migration of surface-modified nanoparticles and significant degradation of chlorinated ethenes, validating the use of nZVI for creating reactive geochemical barriers [cite: 41, 42].\n\n*   **Case Study: US Navy Field Tests**\n    The US Navy conducted comparative field demonstrations at sites like Hunters Point Shipyard and Naval Air Station Jacksonville. These tests evaluated nZVI against microscale iron. At Hunters Point, the injection of iron slurry resulted in a rapid drop in oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) to <-500 mV, creating strongly reducing conditions that facilitated the abiotic dehalogenation of Trichloroethylene (TCE) [cite: 43, 44].\n\n*   **Case Study: Nitrastur Site, Spain**\n    As part of the NanoRem project, nZVI was injected to remediate arsenic-contaminated groundwater. The iron nanoparticles immobilized arsenic through adsorption and reduction mechanisms (converting As(V) and As(III) to insoluble As(0)).
