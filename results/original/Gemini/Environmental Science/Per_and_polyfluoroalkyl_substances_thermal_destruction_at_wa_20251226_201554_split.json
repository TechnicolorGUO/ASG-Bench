      "content": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of anthropogenic chemicals characterized by their extreme persistence and resistance to degradation, primarily due to the strength of the carbon-fluorine (C–F) bond. Water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) serve as central collection points for PFAS-laden wastewater, where these contaminants partition significantly into sewage sludge. As regulations restrict the land application of biosolids, thermal destruction technologies have emerged as the primary alternative for permanent PFAS management. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the state of the science regarding thermal destruction of PFAS at WRRFs. We evaluate established technologies, such as Sewage Sludge Incinerators (SSIs), and emerging methods, including pyrolysis, gasification, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), and supercritical water oxidation (SCWO). The review synthesizes current literature on destruction mechanisms, removal efficiencies, and the formation of products of incomplete combustion (PICs). While high-temperature incineration (>1000°C) theoretically achieves mineralization, operational realities in SSIs often fall short, necessitating advanced emission controls. Emerging technologies like SCWO demonstrate destruction efficiencies exceeding 99.9%, though commercial scalability remains a hurdle. The paper concludes by identifying critical research gaps, particularly regarding the fate of volatile organofluorine byproducts and the validation of new stack testing methodologies (OTM-50)."

      "content": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been manufactured and used globally since the 1940s in a vast array of industrial and consumer products, including firefighting foams (AFFF), non-stick cookware, and water-resistant textiles [cite: 1, 2]. Often termed \"forever chemicals,\" PFAS are defined by their perfluoroalkyl moiety, where carbon atoms are fully fluorinated, creating a C–F bond that is one of the strongest in organic chemistry [cite: 3, 4]. This stability, while industrially useful, renders PFAS recalcitrant to traditional environmental degradation pathways.\n\nWater Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs) are not producers of PFAS but act as passive receivers and concentrators. PFAS enter WRRFs through domestic sewage, industrial discharges, and landfill leachate [cite: 5, 6]. Conventional wastewater treatment processes, such as activated sludge, are generally ineffective at degrading PFAS. Instead, these compounds tend to partition: short-chain PFAS largely remain in the aqueous effluent discharged to surface waters, while long-chain PFAS preferentially partition into the sewage sludge (biosolids) [cite: 7, 8, 9].\n\nHistorically, the management of sewage sludge has relied heavily on land application as a fertilizer, which recycles nutrients. However, the discovery of PFAS contamination in agricultural soils and groundwater linked to biosolids has precipitated a regulatory crisis [cite: 5, 10]. With bans on land application emerging in jurisdictions like Maine, WRRFs are urgently seeking alternative disposal methods [cite: 5]. Thermal destruction offers the potential to break the PFAS cycle by mineralizing these compounds. However, the efficacy of thermal treatment is a subject of intense scientific debate, centering on whether these processes completely destroy the molecule or merely transform it into volatile, potentially toxic byproducts [cite: 11, 12].\n\nThis paper reviews the current scientific understanding of PFAS thermal destruction within the context of municipal wastewater treatment, evaluating the efficacy, mechanisms, and environmental safety of various thermal technologies."

In North America, over 100 SSIs are in operation, primarily utilizing Multiple Hearth Furnaces (MHF) or Fluidized Bed Furnaces (FBF) [cite: 12, 15].\n\n*   **Operational Parameters:** FBFs generally operate at more uniform and higher temperatures (>800°C) compared to MHFs, which have temperature gradients. Complete mineralization of PFAS is generally cited to require temperatures >1000°C for 1–2 seconds, conditions rarely met by standard SSIs [cite: 10, 11].\n*   **Fate of PFAS:** Studies indicate that SSIs effectively remove PFAS from the solid ash residue. However, the primary concern is the transfer of PFAS to the gas phase. A 2024 study on full-scale SSIs found that while the ash was largely free of PFAS, the stack emissions contained short-chain PFAS and volatile alkanes, representing 0.5%–4.5% of greenhouse gas emissions [cite: 27, 28].\n*   **Limitations:** The formation of HF causes refractory corrosion, and the potential for emitting PICs remains the primary regulatory hurdle [cite: 4, 29]."

The science has advanced significantly, moving from a basic understanding of PFAS presence to complex evaluations of thermal degradation mechanisms.\n\nCurrent evidence suggests that while conventional Sewage Sludge Incinerators can achieve significant PFAS removal from solids, they carry a risk of emitting volatile transformation products if not operated at sufficiently high temperatures with robust off-gas treatment. Emerging technologies like Pyrolysis and SCWO offer higher destruction efficiencies and the potential for resource recovery, but they require further validation at commercial scales.\n\nThe release of the EPA's 2024 guidance and OTM-50 marks a turning point, shifting the focus from simple removal to comprehensive destruction verification. The future of PFAS management at WRRFs lies in the integration of these advanced thermal technologies with rigorous emissions monitoring, ensuring that the solution to water pollution does not become a source of air pollution."
