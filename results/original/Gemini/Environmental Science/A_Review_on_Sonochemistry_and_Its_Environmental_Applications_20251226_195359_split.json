Conventional treatment methodologies, such as biological digestion and physical filtration, often fall short in mineralizing complex organic compounds, \"forever chemicals\" like PFAS, and emerging contaminants like microplastics. In this context, sonochemistry—the application of ultrasound to chemical systems—has emerged as a potent \"green chemistry\" technology [cite: 12, 13].\n\nSonochemistry does not rely on the direct interaction of sound waves with molecules; rather, it derives its power from acoustic cavitation. This phenomenon concentrates diffuse sound energy into microscopic \"hot spots,\" driving high-energy chemical reactions in condensed phases under ambient conditions [cite: 14, 15]. The versatility of sonochemistry allows it to function both as a destructive force for pollutants and as an intensification tool for other processes, such as mass transfer in soil washing or sludge hydrolysis [cite: 16, 17].\n\nThis review provides a comprehensive systematic analysis of sonochemistry’s role in environmental remediation. It examines the theoretical underpinnings of acoustic cavitation, traces the historical evolution of the field, and critically evaluates state-of-the-art applications in water, air, and soil treatment. Furthermore, it addresses the techno-economic barriers to scale-up and outlines future research directions necessary to transition sonochemical technologies from the laboratory to industrial implementation."

When high-intensity ultrasonic waves (typically 20 kHz to 1 MHz) propagate through a liquid medium, they create alternating cycles of compression (positive pressure) and rarefaction (negative pressure) [cite: 12, 14].\n\n1.  **Nucleation:** During the rarefaction cycle, if the negative pressure exceeds the tensile strength of the liquid, voids or cavities are formed, often originating from pre-existing gas nuclei or impurities [cite: 13].\n2.  **Growth:** These bubbles grow over several acoustic cycles through a process known as rectified diffusion, where gas enters the bubble during expansion more easily than it leaves during compression [cite: 18].\n3.  **Collapse:** Once the bubble reaches a critical resonance size, it can no longer sustain itself against the acoustic field. It collapses implosively during a compression cycle. This collapse is nearly adiabatic, generating extreme local conditions [cite: 2, 14]."

From the early observations of Wood and Loomis in 1927 to the modern destruction of PFAS and microplastics, the field has evolved from a physical curiosity to a sophisticated advanced oxidation process.\n\nThe technology's ability to generate extreme conditions (5000 K, 1000 atm) locally while maintaining ambient bulk conditions allows for the destruction of refractory compounds that resist conventional treatment. Its application in enhancing biogas production and cleaning industrial flue gases further underscores its versatility.\n\nHowever, the path to industrialization is obstructed by high energy costs and scale-up complexities. The future of environmental sonochemistry lies in **hybridization**—combining ultrasound with other oxidation technologies—and **process intensification**, where reactor designs are optimized for maximum energy efficiency. As research continues to bridge the gap between laboratory efficiency and industrial viability, sonochemistry is poised to play a critical role in the next generation of environmental remediation technologies."
