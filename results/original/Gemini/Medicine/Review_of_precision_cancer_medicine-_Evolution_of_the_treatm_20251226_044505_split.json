This systematic literature review examines the evolution of PCM, tracing its historical roots from early hormonal therapies to the landmark approval of targeted agents like imatinib and trastuzumab, and the recent explosion of tissue-agnostic approvals. We critically analyze key clinical trials, including NCI-MATCH, SHIVA, I-PREDICT, and TAPUR, to evaluate the efficacy and limitations of genomic matching. While next-generation sequencing (NGS) and liquid biopsies have revolutionized diagnostics, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, drug resistance, and financial toxicity remain significant barriers. Furthermore, we explore the emerging frontier of functional precision medicine (FPM) and artificial intelligence (AI) as complementary tools to static genomic profiling. This review synthesizes current evidence to identify research gaps and future directions necessary to realize the full potential of personalized oncology."

      "content": "Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, characterized by immense biological complexity and heterogeneity. Historically, cancer treatment was dictated primarily by the anatomical origin of the tumor and its histological appearance, with cytotoxic chemotherapy serving as the backbone of systemic therapy. While effective in some contexts, this empirical approach often results in significant toxicity and variable efficacy due to the lack of tumor specificity [cite: 1, 2, 3].\n\nThe advent of precision medicine—often used interchangeably with personalized medicine—has fundamentally altered this landscape. Defined by the National Cancer Institute as a form of medicine that uses information about a person's genes, proteins, and environment to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease [cite: 4], PCM aims to deliver the right drug to the right patient at the right time [cite: 5]. This paradigm shift was catalyzed by the completion of the Human Genome Project and the subsequent reduction in sequencing costs, enabling the routine identification of \"driver\" mutations that promote oncogenesis [cite: 6, 7].\n\nThe objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of precision cancer medicine. We explore the technological milestones that enabled this transition, the clinical evidence supporting biomarker-driven therapies, and the persistent challenges that hinder widespread implementation. By synthesizing data from landmark clinical trials and emerging research, we aim to provide a critical assessment of the field's current state and its future trajectory."

      "content": "To understand the evolution of PCM, it is essential to define the core concepts that underpin this discipline:\n\n*   **Precision Oncology:** The application of precision medicine specifically to cancer care, utilizing molecular profiling (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) to guide therapeutic decisions [cite: 5, 8].\n*   **Biomarkers:** Biological molecules found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that are a sign of a normal or abnormal process, or of a condition or disease. In oncology, predictive biomarkers (e.g., *HER2* amplification, *EGFR* mutations) indicate the likelihood of response to a specific therapeutic agent [cite: 1, 4].\n*   **Targeted Therapy:** Drugs designed to interfere with specific molecules (\"molecular targets\") involved in the growth, progression, and spread of cancer, contrasting with chemotherapy which acts on all rapidly dividing cells [cite: 2, 3].\n*   **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):** High-throughput DNA sequencing technologies that allow for the rapid sequencing of large stretches of DNA, enabling the simultaneous detection of multiple genetic alterations (mutations, copy number variations, fusions) [cite: 6, 8].\n*   **Liquid Biopsy:** A minimally invasive alternative to surgical biopsy that detects circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood, allowing for real-time monitoring of tumor dynamics and resistance mechanisms [cite: 7, 9].\n*   **Tissue-Agnostic Therapy:** Treatments approved based on the presence of a specific molecular alteration regardless of the tumor's anatomical origin (e.g., pembrolizumab for MSI-H/dMMR tumors) [cite: 10, 11].\n*   **Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB):** A measurement of the number of mutations carried by tumor cells, used as a biomarker to predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitors [cite: 12]."

The identification of key driver mutations and the development of targeted therapies have improved survival and quality of life for countless patients. However, the \"one gene, one drug\" model has shown its limitations in the face of tumor complexity and heterogeneity.\n\nThe future of PCM lies in a more holistic approach. It requires the integration of multi-omics data, the adoption of functional testing to validate genomic predictions, and the use of AI to decipher complex biological patterns. Moreover, addressing the systemic barriers of cost and access is as critical as the scientific advancements. As the field moves toward combination therapies and dynamic monitoring via liquid biopsy, the goal of transforming cancer into a curable or manageable chronic condition for all patients comes closer to realization."
