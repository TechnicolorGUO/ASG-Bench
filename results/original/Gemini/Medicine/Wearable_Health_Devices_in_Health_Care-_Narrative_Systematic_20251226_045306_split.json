With the proliferation of sensors capable of tracking physiological and biochemical markers, wearable health devices (WHDs) have evolved from simple fitness trackers to sophisticated clinical tools.\n**Objectives:** This narrative systematic review aims to comprehensively analyze the current landscape of WHDs, evaluating their historical evolution, technological state-of-the-art, clinical applications, and the multifaceted challenges hindering widespread medical adoption.\n**Methods:** A comprehensive review of literature published between 2015 and 2025 was conducted, synthesizing data on sensor technologies, clinical validation studies (including the Apple Heart Study and Fitbit Heart Study), and material sciences.\n**Results:** WHDs have demonstrated significant clinical utility in cardiovascular monitoring, particularly in the detection of atrial fibrillation, with positive predictive values ranging from 71% to 98% in large-scale populations. Technological advancements in flexible electronics (e-skin), non-invasive sweat sensing, and energy harvesting (triboelectric nanogenerators) are addressing previous limitations in comfort and battery life.

Historically, medical practice has been episodic and reactive, relying on data collected during infrequent clinical visits. This model often fails to capture the dynamic nature of physiological processes and the early warning signs of chronic conditions. Wearable Health Devices (WHDs) have emerged as a disruptive solution, offering the capability for continuous, non-invasive, and real-time monitoring of vital signs and metabolic status [cite: 3, 4].\n\nThe rapid development of WHDs has been fueled by miniaturization in electronics and advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT). These devices, ranging from smartwatches and wristbands to smart clothing and patches, serve a dual purpose: assisting individuals in pursuing healthier lifestyles and providing clinicians with a constant stream of healthcare data for diagnosis and treatment [cite: 1, 5]. Despite their promise, the transition of WHDs from consumer gadgets to medical-grade instruments involves complex challenges related to accuracy, clinical validity, and data security [cite: 6, 7].\n\nThis review provides a comprehensive analysis of the field, moving beyond consumer trends to evaluate the clinical efficacy and technological maturity of modern WHDs. It synthesizes findings from landmark clinical trials, explores cutting-edge developments in flexible electronics and biochemical sensing, and critically examines the regulatory and ethical hurdles that must be overcome to achieve full integration into the healthcare ecosystem."

The field is currently advancing toward flexible, skin-like form factors and biochemical sensing, promising a future where health monitoring is invisible, continuous, and deeply personalized.\n\nHowever, the path to widespread medical adoption is obstructed by significant challenges. Regulatory frameworks must evolve to manage AI-driven software, and robust data privacy protections are essential to maintain user trust. Furthermore, the gap between data collection and clinical actionability must be bridged through better EHR integration and AI-driven insights.
