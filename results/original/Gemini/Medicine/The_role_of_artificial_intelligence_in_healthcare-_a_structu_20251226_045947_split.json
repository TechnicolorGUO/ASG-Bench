From early expert systems to contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) and deep learning algorithms, AI promises to revolutionize patient care, administrative efficiency, and pharmaceutical development.\n**Objectives:** This systematic literature review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the role of AI in healthcare, tracing its historical evolution, defining key concepts, evaluating state-of-the-art methods, and critically assessing applications, challenges, and future directions.\n**Methods:** A structured review of literature published up to 2025 was conducted, focusing on peer-reviewed journals, technical reports, and case studies. The review synthesizes findings on machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and robotic surgery.\n**Results:** The literature reveals that AI has achieved expert-level performance in specific diagnostic tasks, particularly in radiology and pathology. The 2024 release of AlphaFold 3 marks a watershed moment for drug discovery. However, systemic failures, such as the discontinuation of IBM Watson Health, highlight the gap between technical capability and clinical utility.\n**Conclusion:** While AI offers unprecedented opportunities for precision medicine and operational efficiency, its successful implementation requires robust governance frameworks, solutions to the \"black box\" interpretability problem, and rigorous validation of clinical outcomes.\n\n---"

Artificial Intelligence (AI), once a futuristic concept, has become a central pillar of medical innovation. The motivation for integrating AI into healthcare stems from the urgent need to address the \"iron triangle\" of healthcare: improving access, reducing costs, and enhancing quality [cite: 1, 2]. With the volume of medical data—ranging from genomic sequences to electronic health records (EHRs)—exceeding the processing capacity of human clinicians, AI offers the necessary tools to synthesize vast datasets into actionable clinical insights [cite: 3, 4].\n\nThe objective of this paper is to provide a rigorous, systematic review of the AI landscape in healthcare. Unlike previous reviews that may focus solely on technical metrics or specific medical specialties, this paper adopts a holistic view. It examines the trajectory from early rule-based systems to the generative AI revolution of 2023-2024, analyzes high-profile successes and failures, and identifies the ethical and technical barriers preventing widespread adoption."
