# Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Treatment of Patients Infected with 2019-New Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): A Review and Perspective

**Key Points**
*   **Integrative Approach:** Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been formally integrated into the Chinese national protocol for COVID-19, utilizing a "Three Medicines and Three Prescriptions" strategy that covers the full spectrum of disease severity [cite: 1, 2].
*   **Clinical Efficacy:** Meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest that TCM formulations, such as Qingfei Paidu Decoction and Lianhua Qingwen, can shorten viral shedding time, alleviate symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue), and reduce the rate of progression to severe illness [cite: 3, 4, 5].
*   **Mechanisms of Action:** Pharmacological studies indicate that key TCM compounds may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication (targeting ACE2 and 3CLpro) and regulate the immune response by suppressing the "cytokine storm" (IL-6, TNF- $\alpha$) [cite: 6, 7, 8].
*   **Safety Profile:** Systematic reviews generally report that TCM treatments for COVID-19 are safe, with adverse event rates comparable to control groups, though high-quality, large-scale international trials remain necessary to fully validate these findings globally [cite: 2, 9, 10].
*   **Long COVID Potential:** Emerging research highlights the potential of TCM and acupuncture in managing Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), particularly for fatigue, insomnia, and respiratory dysfunction [cite: 11, 12].

## Abstract

The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) precipitated a global public health crisis, necessitating the rapid evaluation of therapeutic interventions. In China, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) was deployed extensively alongside Western medicine as part of a unique integrative treatment model. This systematic literature review evaluates the efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19, with a specific focus on the "Three Medicines and Three Prescriptions" (Lianhua Qingwen, Jinhua Qinggan, Xuebijing, Qingfei Paidu, Huashibaidu, and Xuanfeibaidu). A comprehensive analysis of randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and pharmacological studies reveals that TCM interventions are associated with improved clinical cure rates, shortened viral shedding duration, and reduced progression to critical illness. Mechanistic studies suggest these effects are mediated through antiviral activity and immunomodulation, specifically the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Despite promising results, the field faces challenges regarding methodological heterogeneity and international standardization. This paper synthesizes current evidence, identifies research gaps, and proposes future directions for the modernization and global integration of TCM in pandemic preparedness.

## 1. Introduction and Background

The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in late 2019 led to a pandemic that overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide. In the absence of specific antiviral agents during the early stages of the outbreak, the National Health Commission of China implemented a strategy of integrating Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with conventional Western medicine [cite: 1, 13]. This approach was predicated on the historical success of TCM in managing epidemic diseases, including the 2003 SARS outbreak and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [cite: 14, 15].

The motivation for this review stems from the substantial volume of clinical data generated regarding TCM's role in COVID-19 management. Reports indicate that over 90% of confirmed cases in China received some form of TCM treatment [cite: 3, 16]. Unlike the reductionist approach often seen in Western pharmacology, which targets specific viral proteins, TCM employs a holistic approach based on syndrome differentiation (*Bian Zheng*), aiming to restore physiological balance and enhance the host's immune response [cite: 6, 17].

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive, critical analysis of the existing literature. It examines the "Three Medicines and Three Prescriptions" which form the core of the official TCM treatment protocol, analyzes the molecular mechanisms through network pharmacology, and evaluates clinical outcomes ranging from symptom relief in mild cases to the suppression of cytokine storms in severe cases. Furthermore, it addresses the emerging application of TCM in treating Long COVID and discusses the methodological hurdles that must be overcome for broader scientific acceptance.

## 2. Key Concepts and Definitions

### 2.1 TCM Etiology of COVID-19
In TCM theory, COVID-19 is categorized as a "pestilence" (*Yi Bing*) or "damp-toxin pestilence" (*Shi Du Yi*). The pathogenesis is characterized by the invasion of "dampness" and "toxin" pathogens which obstruct the lungs and spleen, leading to stagnation of Qi and accumulation of heat [cite: 13, 18]. The disease progression is viewed through four stages: early (prevention/mild), middle (pneumonia/moderate), critical (respiratory failure/severe), and recovery [cite: 1].

### 2.2 The "Three Medicines and Three Prescriptions"
The Chinese clinical guidance highlights six key formulations, collectively known as the "Three Medicines and Three Prescriptions" (3M3P), which have been the subject of the most rigorous testing:
1.  **Lianhua Qingwen (LHQW) Capsules/Granules:** Originally developed for SARS, used for mild to moderate cases with fever and lung heat [cite: 4, 19].
2.  **Jinhua Qinggan (JHQG) Granules:** Developed for H1N1, used for mild cases with fever [cite: 15, 20].
3.  **Xuebijing (XBJ) Injection:** An intravenous formulation used for severe/critical cases to treat sepsis and systemic inflammation [cite: 21, 22].
4.  **Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QFPDD):** A general prescription applicable to all stages, derived from combining four classical formulas [cite: 3, 23].
5.  **Huashibaidu (HSBD) Formula:** Targeted for severe cases with heavy damp-toxin accumulation [cite: 24, 25].
6.  **Xuanfeibaidu (XFBD) Formula:** Used for moderate cases to detoxify the lungs and clear dampness [cite: 18, 26].

## 3. Historical Development and Milestones

### 3.1 Ancient Foundations
China has a recorded history of over 300 epidemics spanning two millennia. The theoretical foundation for treating these outbreaks lies in classical texts such as the *Shanghan Lun* (Treatise on Cold Damage) and *Wenbing* (Warm Diseases) theories. These texts provided the framework for formulas like *Maxing Shigan Tang*, which serves as a foundational component for many modern COVID-19 prescriptions [cite: 14, 27].

### 3.2 Modern Precedents: SARS and H1N1
The integration of TCM into epidemic control was significantly advanced during the 2003 SARS outbreak. Studies from that period suggested that TCM could reduce mortality and the side effects of corticosteroids [cite: 14, 28]. Similarly, during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, formulations like Jinhua Qinggan were developed and validated, establishing a regulatory pathway for TCM in acute infectious diseases [cite: 15, 20].

### 3.3 COVID-19 Milestones
*   **January 2020:** The National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine dispatched expert teams to Wuhan.
*   **February 2020:** Qingfei Paidu Decoction was recommended for nationwide use after showing efficacy in pilot trials [cite: 23].
*   **March 2020:** The "Three Medicines and Three Prescriptions" were officially included in the national diagnosis and treatment guidelines [cite: 20].
*   **March 2022:** The World Health Organization (WHO) convened an expert meeting, acknowledging that TCM is beneficial for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and encouraging further study [cite: 2, 29].

## 4. Current State-of-the-Art Methods and Techniques

### 4.1 Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking
Modern research into TCM utilizes network pharmacology to elucidate the "multi-component, multi-target" mechanisms of herbal formulas.
*   **Antiviral Targets:** Compounds such as quercetin, luteolin, and kaempferol (found in LHQW and HSBD) have been shown to bind to SARS-CoV-2 targets, including the main protease (3CLpro) and the spike protein-ACE2 interface, potentially inhibiting viral entry and replication [cite: 6, 7, 30].
*   **Anti-inflammatory Pathways:** TCM formulas modulate signaling pathways such as TNF, MAPK, and NF- $\kappa$B. For instance, Xuebijing injection has been shown to inhibit the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and suppress the expression of IL-6 and TNF- $\alpha$, which are key drivers of the cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 [cite: 8, 22, 31].

### 4.2 Mechanism of Specific Formulas
*   **Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QFPDD):** Acts on metabolic programming and immune regulation. It combines 21 herbs that collectively clear lung heat and dispel dampness. Meta-analyses suggest it regulates immune responses to prevent the transition from mild to severe stages [cite: 3, 32].
*   **Huashibaidu (HSBD):** Designed for severe cases, it targets the "cytokine storm." Active compounds like echinatin and licochalcone B have demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in SARS-CoV-2 infected cell models [cite: 25, 33].
*   **Lianhua Qingwen (LHQW):** In vitro studies demonstrate that LHQW inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells and reduces the production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, CCL-2/MCP-1) [cite: 19, 34].

## 5. Applications and Case Studies

### 5.1 Treatment of Mild to Moderate Cases
The primary goal in mild cases is symptom management and prevention of disease progression.
*   **Lianhua Qingwen:** A multicenter RCT involving 284 patients showed that LHQW significantly improved the recovery rate of symptoms (fever, fatigue, cough) compared to the control group (91.5% vs. 82.4%). It also shortened the median duration of fever by 1.5 days. However, it did not show a significant difference in the rate of conversion to severe cases or viral shedding duration in some studies [cite: 4, 19, 35].
*   **Jinhua Qinggan:** A randomized trial indicated that JHQG combined with Western medicine relieved fever and poor appetite more effectively than Western medicine alone and reduced the need for antibiotics [cite: 36, 37]. Another study showed a clinical efficacy of 82.67% compared to 10.74% in the placebo group for mild cases [cite: 38].

### 5.2 Treatment of Severe and Critical Cases
In severe cases, the focus shifts to suppressing systemic inflammation and organ protection.
*   **Xuebijing Injection:** A randomized controlled trial involving severe patients found that adding Xuebijing to standard care significantly reduced the 28-day mortality rate (by approximately 8.8% in some cohorts) and improved the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). It effectively suppressed IL-6 and TNF- $\alpha$ levels, mitigating the cytokine storm [cite: 21, 22, 31].
*   **Huashibaidu & Xuanfeibaidu:** Clinical studies on Xuanfeibaidu showed it could significantly increase lymphocyte counts and reduce C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), indicating an anti-inflammatory effect [cite: 18, 39]. Huashibaidu has been associated with shorter hospital stays and improved lung CT imaging recovery [cite: 24, 40].

### 5.3 General Efficacy: Qingfei Paidu Decoction
As the most widely recommended formula, QFPDD has been subjected to extensive meta-analysis. Data from 9 trials involving 1108 patients demonstrated that QFPDD combined with Western medicine reduced the aggravation rate by 71% (RR = 0.29), increased the effective cure rate by 13%, and shortened viral shedding by approximately 4.78 days compared to Western medicine alone [cite: 3, 41].

### 5.4 Acupuncture
Acupuncture has been utilized as an adjunctive therapy. Systematic reviews indicate that acupuncture can alleviate symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and anxiety in COVID-19 patients. It is also being explored for its potential to regulate the neuro-immune system and improve respiratory function [cite: 42, 43, 44].

## 6. Challenges and Open Problems

### 6.1 Methodological Quality of Evidence
While the volume of literature is vast, the quality varies. Many early studies were observational or retrospective. A review of systematic reviews noted that the methodological quality of many included studies was "moderate to poor" due to issues like lack of blinding (difficult in herbal decoction trials), small sample sizes, and heterogeneity in control group treatments [cite: 45, 46, 47].

### 6.2 Safety and Toxicity
Although systematic reviews generally report no serious adverse events (SAEs) directly attributable to TCM interventions for COVID-19 [cite: 2, 3, 9], concerns remain regarding potential liver and kidney toxicity associated with certain herbal ingredients if used improperly. However, meta-analyses of Xuebijing and QFPDD have found the incidence of adverse events to be comparable to or lower than control groups [cite: 9, 48].

### 6.3 International Acceptance and Standardization
The globalization of TCM for COVID-19 faces regulatory hurdles. While approved in China and some other nations (e.g., usage in Laos, approval of LHQW in several countries), Western regulatory bodies (FDA, EMA) require rigorous pharmacological standardization which is difficult for complex multi-herb formulas. The "individualized" nature of TCM diagnosis also conflicts with the standardized protocols preferred in Western clinical trials [cite: 16, 49].

## 7. Future Research Directions

### 7.1 Long COVID (Post-Acute Sequelae)
A significant frontier for TCM is the treatment of Long COVID. Preliminary trials on formulas like **Liujunzhi Decoction** and **Shashen Maidong Decoction** (combined as "COVID-19 Rehab Formula") are underway to address residual symptoms like fatigue, dyspnea, and insomnia [cite: 12, 50]. A meta-analysis of 10 RCTs involving 2401 patients suggested that Chinese herbal medicine significantly improved chest tightness and insomnia in post-COVID patients [cite: 10, 11].

### 7.2 High-Quality Clinical Trials
Future research must prioritize double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs with large sample sizes to generate high-certainty evidence. Protocols should adhere to international reporting standards (e.g., CONSORT extensions for herbal medicine) to enhance credibility [cite: 45, 47].

### 7.3 Elucidation of Molecular Mechanisms
Continued use of network pharmacology combined with in vivo validation is necessary to identify the specific bioactive compounds responsible for antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. This "bench-to-bedside" approach is crucial for drug discovery and international acceptance [cite: 7, 51].

## 8. Conclusion

The integration of Traditional Chinese Medicine into the treatment of COVID-19 represents a significant paradigm in pandemic response. The "Three Medicines and Three Prescriptions" have demonstrated clinical utility in alleviating symptoms, reducing viral loads, and mitigating inflammatory responses, particularly through the suppression of the cytokine storm. While the field is bolstered by a growing body of evidence, including meta-analyses supporting efficacy and safety, it remains constrained by methodological limitations and the complexities of cross-cultural medical integration.

The perspective for TCM in COVID-19 is cautiously optimistic. It offers a valuable therapeutic arsenal, particularly in resource-limited settings or as a complementary approach where specific antivirals are unavailable or partially effective. Future success depends on rigorous scientific validation, standardization of formulations, and a continued focus on both acute management and the burgeoning challenge of Long COVID.
