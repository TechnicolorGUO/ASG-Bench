This immaturity limits their utility in drug screening and poses arrhythmia risks in regenerative therapies.\n*   **Multidimensional Maturation:** True maturation requires synchronous development across multiple axes: a metabolic switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation, structural organization (T-tubules, sarcomere alignment), and electrophysiological refinement (hyperpolarized resting potential).\n*   **Recent Breakthroughs (2024-2025):** Significant strides have been made recently, including the development of vascularized cardiac organoids (\"vaschamcardioids\") that overcome size limitations, and combinatorial protocols integrating metabolic selection, nanopatterning, and electrical stimulation to induce adult-like phenotypes.\n*   **Clinical Translation:** Clinical trials (e.g., Heartseed, HELP Therapeutics) are currently evaluating hiPSC-CM spheroids and patches for heart failure. However, engraftment arrhythmia remains a critical safety challenge, currently managed pharmacologically or through improved cell purity.\n\n***"

      "content": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, necessitating novel therapeutic strategies beyond standard pharmacotherapy and surgical interventions. The adult human heart possesses negligible regenerative capacity; consequently, the loss of cardiomyocytes (CMs) following myocardial infarction (MI) leads to permanent fibrotic scarring and progressive heart failure. The advent of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has revolutionized cardiovascular research, offering an unlimited source of patient-specific cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) for disease modeling, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine [cite: 1, 2].\n\nHowever, a critical barrier impedes the full translational potential of hiPSC-CMs: their developmental immaturity. Standard differentiation protocols yield CMs that structurally, functionally, and metabolically resemble fetal rather than adult myocardium [cite: 3, 4]. These immature cells exhibit spontaneous automaticity, rely on glycolysis, and lack the force-generating capacity of adult tissue. In regenerative medicine, the transplantation of immature cells carries significant risks of fatal arrhythmias due to poor electromechanical integration [cite: 5, 6]. In drug screening, the fetal phenotype can lead to inaccurate predictions of drug toxicity and efficacy [cite: 7].\n\nThis systematic review critically examines the current state of cardiomyocyte maturation. We analyze the biological hallmarks of maturation, trace the historical evolution of differentiation protocols, and detail state-of-the-art bioengineering strategies—including recent 2024-2025 breakthroughs in vascularized organoids and combinatorial stimulation. Finally, we discuss the implications of these advances for clinical trials and identify persistent challenges in the field."

They possess a highly organized sarcomeric structure with distinct Z-discs, M-bands, and a high density of mitochondria positioned between myofibrils. A defining feature of adult CMs is the presence of Transverse tubules (T-tubules), invaginations of the sarcolemma that bring L-type calcium channels into proximity with ryanodine receptors (RyRs) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), ensuring synchronous calcium release [cite: 8, 9]. In contrast, hiPSC-CMs are typically small, rounded, and lack T-tubules, resulting in asynchronous calcium propagation [cite: 1, 10]."

The \"GiWi\" protocol (GSK3 inhibition/Wnt inhibition) became the gold standard for producing high-purity CMs [cite: 17]. However, researchers quickly noted that these cells remained arrested at an embryonic stage [cite: 18].\n*   **2011-2015: Biophysical and Biochemical Cues:** Research shifted to mimicking the in vivo environment. Studies demonstrated that long-term culture (up to 120 days) improved maturation but was inefficient [cite: 2, 18]. The introduction of triiodothyronine (T3) hormone and substrate stiffness modulation marked the beginning of active maturation strategies [cite: 8, 15].\n*   **2016-2020: Metabolic Selection and 3D Engineering:** A pivotal milestone was the development of metabolic selection using lactate-supplemented, glucose-depleted media. This method exploited the metabolic flexibility of CMs to purify cultures while simultaneously driving oxidative metabolism [cite: 19, 20]. Concurrently, Engineered Heart Tissues (EHTs) utilizing pillars for auxotonic load demonstrated that 3D mechanical stress is essential for structural alignment [cite: 21, 22].\n*   **2021-Present: Organoids and Combinatorial Protocols:** The field has moved toward \"vaschamcardioids\" and complex organoids that integrate vascularization and multi-lineage cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells) to recapitulate the cardiac niche [cite: 23, 24]."

This \"metabolic maturation medium\" has been shown to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, increase contractile force, and upregulate ion channels [cite: 12, 13, 25].\n*   **Lactate Selection:** Recent refinements in 2024-2025 have optimized lactate-based purification.
