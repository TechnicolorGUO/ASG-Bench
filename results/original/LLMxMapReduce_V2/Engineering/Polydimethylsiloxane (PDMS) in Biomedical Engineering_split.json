      "content": "Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a silicone-based elastomer that has emerged as a pivotal material in biomedical engineering due to its exceptional biocompatibility, mechanical flexibility, optical transparency, and chemical inertness [1]. These intrinsic properties make PDMS particularly well-suited for a wide array of applications, including microfluidic devices, tissue engineering scaffolds, biomedical sensors, and soft robotics. The material’s versatility is further enhanced by its ease of fabrication, which allows for the creation of complex microstructures through techniques such as soft-lithography [5]. This fabrication capability is crucial for developing microchannels, which are essential components in microfluidic systems designed to replicate physiological environments and support in vitro studies of cellular behavior and biomodel development [6].\n\nIn the context of tissue engineering, PDMS is employed to fabricate three-dimensional scaffolds with tailored micro-architecture and surface topography, enabling the mimicry of the extracellular matrix and the guidance of cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation [3]. Surface modification techniques, such as chemical or physical treatments, further expand PDMS’s utility in creating functional interfaces for cell–material interactions [1]. However, despite its widespread use, the long-term stability of PDMS under various storage conditions remains a critical concern. Natural aging can induce changes in hydrophilicity and mechanical properties, which may compromise the performance of PDMS-based devices over time [2].\n\nBeyond its traditional applications, PDMS is also being explored for emerging biomedical uses, such as in heat transfer systems and face masks, demonstrating its adaptability to new technological demands [4]. While the reviewed literature provides a general overview of PDMS and its applications, there is a notable lack of in-depth technical detail on its molecular structure, chemical properties, and specific physical characteristics. This gap in the literature suggests a need for more rigorous and comprehensive studies that address the fundamental properties of PDMS, particularly in relation to its performance in biological and environmental contexts. Future research should focus on improving the mechanical durability, surface functionalization, and integration of PDMS with advanced fabrication techniques to further enhance its applicability in biomedical engineering."

      "content": "The reviewed literature provides a general overview of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and its properties, with a particular emphasis on its applications in biomedical engineering. However, the depth of technical detail varies significantly across the sources. Several papers, such as [4,5], offer broad introductions to PDMS, highlighting its biocompatibility, mechanical flexibility, and versatility in engineering applications. Despite these contributions, they fall short in providing in-depth discussions on the molecular structure, chemical properties, or specific physical characteristics of PDMS that underpin its utility in biomedical contexts.\n\nFor instance, the paper [2] focuses specifically on the aging behavior of PDMS, examining changes in hydrophilicity and mechanical properties under different storage conditions. While this study is valuable for understanding long-term material stability, it does not offer a comprehensive introduction to PDMS itself, making it more suitable for a specialized section rather than a general overview. Similarly, [3,6] emphasize PDMS's role in specific biomedical applications, such as 3D scaffolding and microchannel fabrication, but lack a thorough analysis of the material's fundamental properties.\n\nThe paper [1] provides a descriptive overview of PDMS's use in biomedical engineering, but it lacks analytical depth, particularly in terms of environmental or biological interactions. This limitation restricts its utility in a literature review that seeks to critically evaluate PDMS's suitability for various biomedical applications. Overall, while the reviewed papers collectively contribute to the understanding of PDMS, they often prioritize application-specific insights over a comprehensive exploration of the material's intrinsic properties. As a result, a more detailed and technically rigorous introduction to PDMS, incorporating molecular structure, chemical behavior, and mechanical performance, would enhance the depth and analytical strength of the literature review."

      "content": "The fabrication of PDMS-based devices represents a cornerstone of advancement in biomedical engineering, enabling the development of microfluidic systems, 3D scaffolds, and other bio-integrated structures. Soft-lithography has emerged as the dominant fabrication technique, offering a versatile and scalable approach for creating micro- and nano-scale features. This method facilitates the rapid prototyping of intricate geometries, which are essential for applications ranging from cell culture to drug delivery systems [5]. However, the level of detail provided in existing studies varies significantly, with some focusing on the simulation and validation of specific designs, while others emphasize structural complexity and biological relevance.\n\nOne notable application of PDMS fabrication is the creation of curvilinear microchannels, where computational tools such as MATLAB and ANSYS are used to simulate fluid dynamics before experimental validation. These microchannels, with defined curvature radii and precise dimensions, demonstrate the material’s capacity to support complex fluidic behavior, making them suitable for biomedical applications requiring controlled flow environments [6]. In contrast, the fabrication of 3D PDMS scaffolds for tissue engineering involves a multi-step process, including microfabrication of SU-8 molds, dual-sided molding using a mechanical jig, and layer stacking to achieve high porosity and structural fidelity. These scaffolds mimic the extracellular matrix, thereby supporting cell growth and tissue regeneration [6].\n\nDespite the adaptability of PDMS fabrication techniques, several challenges persist. The absence of standardized protocols in many studies limits reproducibility, particularly in soft-lithography, where procedural details are often omitted [5]. Additionally, while some studies present highly sophisticated methods—such as the use of custom jigs for 3D scaffolding—these approaches frequently lack comparative analysis with conventional techniques like injection molding or replica molding, thereby restricting their broader applicability [3]. Furthermore, the experimental validation in certain studies is constrained to narrow parameter ranges, which may not fully reflect the dynamic conditions encountered in real-world biomedical systems [6].\n\nTo address these limitations, future research should prioritize the development of standardized fabrication protocols and comprehensive comparative studies that evaluate the performance, scalability, and reproducibility of different PDMS fabrication techniques. Such efforts would not only enhance the reliability of PDMS-based devices but also expand their potential in emerging fields such as organ-on-a-chip systems, biosensors, and personalized medicine. By integrating computational modeling, advanced microfabrication, and systematic validation, the fabrication of PDMS-based devices can continue to evolve as a critical enabler of innovation in biomedical engineering."

      "content": "The fabrication of PDMS-based devices and structures has been extensively explored in biomedical engineering, with soft-lithography emerging as a dominant technique. This method enables the rapid prototyping of micro- and nanostructures, which are essential for applications in microfluidics, electronics, and biomedical systems [5]. While the general utility of soft-lithography is well-documented, the specific procedural details are often omitted, limiting its direct applicability for researchers seeking to replicate the methods. Nevertheless, the technique's adaptability and versatility have been demonstrated in various contexts, including the creation of complex microchannel geometries and three-dimensional scaffolds.\n\nIn one study, curvilinear microchannels were fabricated using PDMS, with designs simulated using MATLAB and ANSYS to predict flow behavior. The fabricated microchannels, designated as 5CACMC and 5CDCMC, featured a total length of 1.6 cm and a diameter of 400 µm, with curvature radii precisely defined to ensure accurate fluid dynamics analysis. Experimental validation confirmed the simulation results, highlighting the potential of PDMS in creating intricate channel geometries for biomedical applications such as cell culture and drug delivery systems [6].\n\nAnother study focused on the fabrication of 3D PDMS scaffolds for tissue engineering, employing a combination of microfabrication and soft-lithography. The process involved three key steps: (1) microfabrication of a SU-8 photoresist mold, (2) dual-sided molding of PDMS using a mechanical jig for precise alignment, and (3) stacking and adhesion of multiple PDMS layers to form a 3D structure. The resulting scaffolds featured 10 µm diameter posts and 200 × 400 µm horizontal through holes, achieving a porosity of 66%. This level of structural control is critical for mimicking the extracellular matrix and supporting cell growth and tissue regeneration.\n\nComparing these studies, it is evident that PDMS fabrication techniques are highly adaptable, with soft-lithography serving as a foundational method. However, the level of detail provided in each study varies significantly. While some focus on the simulation and validation of microchannel designs, others emphasize the structural complexity of 3D scaffolds. The former highlights the importance of computational modeling in optimizing flow characteristics, while the latter underscores the potential of PDMS in creating biologically relevant environments. Despite these differences, both approaches demonstrate the material's flexibility and its capacity to meet the demands of diverse biomedical applications.\n\nIn terms of limitations, the absence of detailed fabrication protocols in some studies presents a challenge for reproducibility. For instance, the paper on soft-lithography does not elaborate on the specific steps involved in the process, which may hinder its direct implementation. In contrast, the study on 3D scaffolds provides a more structured methodology, albeit with a narrower focus on tissue engineering. These variations reflect the diverse applications of PDMS and the need for tailored fabrication approaches depending on the intended use.\n\nOverall, the fabrication of PDMS-based devices and structures represents a critical area of research in biomedical engineering. The integration of soft-lithography, microfabrication, and computational modeling has enabled the development of sophisticated microfluidic systems and 3D scaffolds. As the field continues to evolve, further research is needed to standardize fabrication protocols and expand the range of possible applications."

This method demonstrates a high level of technical sophistication, particularly in achieving complex 3D structures.

While the integration of computational modeling is a notable strength, the experimental validation is restricted to a narrow set of parameters, which may not capture the full range of conditions encountered in real-world biomedical systems. Additionally, the paper does not compare PDMS fabrication techniques with alternative materials or methods, such as thermoplastic polymers or 3D bioprinting, thereby limiting its applicability for cross-material analysis [6].\n\nCollectively, these studies highlight a common gap in the literature: the absence of systematic comparisons between PDMS fabrication techniques and alternative methodologies. While individual papers may excel in specific aspects—such as the development of novel molds or the use of simulation tools—they often fall short in providing a holistic evaluation of the fabrication landscape. This lack of comparative analysis hinders the ability of researchers to make informed decisions based on technical, economic, and practical considerations. Future studies should address this gap by conducting rigorous comparative studies that evaluate the performance, scalability, and reproducibility of different PDMS fabrication techniques under varied conditions. Such efforts would significantly enhance the utility of PDMS in biomedical engineering applications, particularly in areas such as microfluidics, tissue engineering, and biosensing."

A related study on the effects of natural aging on PDMS properties [2] provides valuable experimental data on how storage conditions influence hydrophilicity and mechanical integrity. While this research is relevant to the \"Mechanical and Surface Properties of PDMS\" section, it lacks a discussion on the implications of these changes for specific biomedical applications, such as implantable devices or tissue engineering scaffolds.\n\nCollectively, these studies reveal a recurring gap in the literature: while PDMS is widely used in biomedical engineering, the lack of systematic mechanical and surface property data impedes its full exploitation. The studies that do provide such data, like the one on natural aging, offer insights into environmental factors that affect PDMS performance, but they often fail to link these findings to practical applications. To address this, future research should prioritize the inclusion of mechanical testing, surface characterization, and comparative analysis across different biomedical scenarios. This would not only enhance the understanding of PDMS behavior but also support the development of more reliable and effective biomedical devices."

      "content": "Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a widely utilized material in biomedical engineering due to its biocompatibility, flexibility, and ease of fabrication. However, its application is constrained by several inherent challenges that affect its long-term performance and reliability in critical biomedical contexts. One of the most significant issues is the natural aging of PDMS, which leads to alterations in its hydrophilicity and mechanical properties over time, particularly under varying storage conditions [2]. This degradation poses a challenge for devices requiring long-term stability, such as implantable microchannels or tissue scaffolds. Additionally, PDMS exhibits inherent hydrophobicity, which can hinder its interaction with biological systems and limit its effectiveness in applications like microfluidic channels and biosensors [4]. This hydrophobic nature also contributes to molecule absorption, which may compromise the accuracy of PDMS-based diagnostic tools.\n\nThe fabrication of PDMS-based devices, particularly microfabricated 3D scaffolds, presents further challenges. Achieving precise micro-architecture and surface topography remains difficult, with critical requirements for alignment tolerances of ±10 µm during the stacking process [3]. Moreover, the lack of extensive in vivo testing limits the translational potential of such scaffolds. In implantable devices, sterilization protocols and the risk of long-term degradation are additional concerns, necessitating careful evaluation of biocompatibility and the potential for adverse biological reactions [6]. While some studies suggest the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology for real-time monitoring of device integrity, the feasibility and effectiveness of such solutions remain underexplored.\n\nDespite the extensive literature on PDMS applications, several reviews highlight a lack of critical analysis of its limitations. For instance, [5] omits a dedicated discussion on challenges such as hydrophobicity, chemical resistance, and biodegradability, focusing instead on its advantages. Similarly, [4] provides only a brief overview of PDMS's limitations without detailed technical explanations or quantitative data to support its claims. These gaps in the literature hinder a comprehensive understanding of PDMS's suitability for biomedical applications and underscore the need for more rigorous and balanced investigations.\n\nOngoing research is exploring strategies to mitigate these challenges, including surface modification, advanced fabrication techniques, and the integration of smart monitoring systems. However, the current body of work lacks a systematic evaluation of PDMS's long-term stability, mechanical durability, and resistance to biological environments. Future studies should address these limitations through more extensive experimental validation, detailed mechanistic analysis, and the development of practical solutions to enhance PDMS's performance in complex biomedical scenarios."

One of the primary concerns is the natural aging of PDMS, which can lead to significant changes in its hydrophilicity and mechanical properties over time, particularly under different storage conditions. This degradation is highlighted in the study by [2], which underscores the need for a more comprehensive understanding of PDMS behavior over extended periods, especially in biomedical devices requiring long-term stability.\n\nIn addition to aging, PDMS exhibits inherent hydrophobicity, which can hinder its interaction with biological systems and affect the performance of devices such as microfluidic channels and tissue scaffolds. This limitation is explicitly discussed in [4], which also notes the issue of molecule absorption, a phenomenon that may compromise the accuracy of PDMS-based sensors and diagnostic tools. These challenges are further compounded by the material’s long-term stability, which remains a concern in applications where prolonged exposure to biological environments is required.\n\nThe challenges of PDMS in biomedical applications are not only material-related but also extend to the fabrication and integration processes. For instance, the development of microfabricated 3D scaffolds using PDMS presents significant difficulties in achieving precise micro-architecture and surface topography, as noted in [3]. The study emphasizes the critical need for precise alignment during the stacking process, with a tolerance of ±10 µm, and highlights the current lack of extensive in vivo testing, which limits the translational potential of such scaffolds.\n\nMoreover, the use of PDMS in implantable devices such as microchannels requires careful consideration of sterilization protocols and the risk of long-term degradation, as outlined in [6]. The paper suggests the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology for real-time monitoring of device integrity, offering a potential solution to some of these challenges. However, the paper also stresses the importance of ensuring biocompatibility and minimizing adverse reactions in the body, which remains a critical concern for PDMS-based implants.\n\nDespite these limitations, some reviews, such as [5], focus more on the benefits and applications of PDMS rather than its drawbacks. Nevertheless, the review implicitly acknowledges that PDMS may have limitations in certain contexts, particularly in terms of long-term stability and interaction with biological systems. This suggests that while PDMS is a versatile material, its application in biomedical engineering requires careful evaluation of both its advantages and its constraints.\n\nIn summary, while PDMS is a valuable material in biomedical engineering, its use is accompanied by a range of challenges, including aging, hydrophobicity, molecule absorption, long-term stability, and fabrication complexities. Ongoing research is exploring various strategies to mitigate these issues, such as surface modification, advanced fabrication techniques, and the integration of smart monitoring systems. These efforts are essential for expanding the utility and reliability of PDMS in more complex and demanding biomedical applications."

The review by [5] points out the absence of a dedicated section on challenges, particularly regarding PDMS's hydrophobicity, chemical resistance, and biodegradability. This omission prevents a balanced evaluation of the material, as the review primarily emphasizes its advantages without adequately addressing its drawbacks. Similarly, [4] acknowledges the challenges associated with PDMS but provides only a brief discussion, lacking detailed technical explanations of the mechanisms behind its hydrophobicity or molecule absorption. The paper also fails to present quantitative data or experimental evidence to substantiate these limitations, making it difficult to assess the validity of the claims.

While it effectively highlights the importance of proper storage protocols to maintain the material’s functional properties, the study is constrained by its limited scope, as it does not extend its findings to broader implications for biomedical applications. In contrast, [3] identifies challenges related to the precision of layer alignment and the lack of in vivo validation, yet it does not thoroughly explore PDMS’s broader limitations, such as its hydrophobic nature, long-term stability, or potential for bioactive modification. This omission restricts the depth of the analysis and limits the applicability of the findings to real-world biomedical scenarios.\n\nAdditionally, [6] notes that while the paper identifies key challenges, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of PDMS’s mechanical durability, long-term biocompatibility, or resistance to biological fluids. The proposed solution of IoT integration is mentioned but not discussed in detail, leaving questions about its feasibility and effectiveness. Overall, the reviewed literature suggests a general underrepresentation of critical limitations and a lack of in-depth technical analysis, which hinders the development of a more holistic understanding of PDMS in biomedical engineering. A more balanced and rigorous discussion of PDMS's challenges would significantly enhance the value of these studies and guide future research toward addressing these limitations."

The section synthesizes insights from recent studies that highlight PDMS's adaptability and versatility, particularly in the development of microfluidic systems, 3D tissue engineering scaffolds, and novel biomedical devices. These applications are increasingly being enhanced through the integration of smart technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which allows for real-time monitoring and dynamic control of physiological environments [6]. This trend reflects a broader shift in biomedical engineering toward more responsive and personalized medical solutions.\n\nIn the realm of tissue engineering, PDMS-based 3D microfabricated scaffolds have shown promise in mimicking native tissue structures, thereby supporting cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. However, the current literature indicates a need for more systematic investigations into how varying surface topographies and material compositions influence cellular behavior, particularly in complex, multi-cellular environments [3]. Additionally, while the potential of PDMS in creating biocompatible and biodegradable scaffolds is recognized, the long-term stability and degradation profiles of these materials in vivo remain underexplored, posing challenges for their use in chronic disease management and implantable devices.\n\nBeyond traditional biomedical applications, PDMS is also being explored for non-traditional uses, such as in transparent face masks for viral protection and serpentine heat exchangers for thermal management in medical devices. These applications underscore the material's broad utility and its capacity to address both medical and industrial challenges [4]. However, the current body of research lacks a clear roadmap for the development and validation of these applications, particularly in terms of scalability, cost-effectiveness, and long-term performance.\n\nDespite the growing body of research on PDMS in biomedical engineering, the future directions proposed in the literature are often vague and lack specific technical or methodological details. For instance, while several studies suggest the integration of bioactive molecules or hybrid material systems, they do not provide concrete strategies for their implementation or evaluation [3,5]. Similarly, the potential of PDMS in IoT-enabled systems is acknowledged, but the specific design considerations, sensor integration, and data processing frameworks required for such systems are not thoroughly discussed [6].\n\nTo address these gaps, future research should focus on the development of more advanced PDMS-based systems that incorporate smart functionalities, such as real-time biosensing, adaptive material responses, and enhanced biocompatibility. This includes the exploration of surface modification techniques, such as plasma treatment, chemical grafting, and nanostructuring, to tailor PDMS properties for specific biomedical applications. Furthermore, the integration of PDMS with other biomaterials, such as hydrogels, polymers, and ceramics, could lead to the creation of multifunctional composites with improved mechanical and biological performance.\n\nIn addition, the field requires more in-depth in vivo studies to evaluate the long-term biocompatibility, degradation, and immune response of PDMS-based devices. These studies should also investigate the interactions between PDMS and biological systems under various physiological conditions, such as inflammation, pH variations, and mechanical stress. By addressing these challenges, researchers can move toward the development of more reliable, durable, and application-specific PDMS-based solutions that meet the evolving demands of biomedical engineering."
