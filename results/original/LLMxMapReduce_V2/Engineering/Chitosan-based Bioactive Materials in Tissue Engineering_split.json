A comprehensive analysis of the available literature reveals that while several studies highlight the advantages of chitosan in biomedical applications, there is a notable gap in the depth of historical and comparative context provided. For instance, the paper titled *chitosan_based_hydrogels_characteristics_and_pharmaceutical_applications* offers a detailed overview of chitosan’s properties and its role in hydrogel development, but it lacks a thorough historical perspective or comparative analysis with other natural polymers such as alginate or cellulose. Similarly, *chitosan_based_bioactive_materials_in_tissue_engineering_applications_a_review* emphasizes chitosan’s superiority over traditional bioactive materials but does not provide sufficient experimental data to substantiate some of its claims, which limits the depth of its analysis. \n\nThe focus on bone tissue engineering is a recurring theme in several papers, including *chitosan_based_bioactive_materials_in_tissue_engineering* and *chitosan_based_scaffolds_for_bone_tissue_engineering*. These studies highlight chitosan’s osteoconductive and biocompatible nature, making it a suitable candidate for bone regeneration. However, they often lack a broader introduction to chitosan’s applications in other biomedical fields, such as wound healing or drug delivery, which could have enriched the context of their findings. Additionally, the paper *porous_chitosan_scaffolds_for_tissue_engineering* provides a general introduction to chitosan’s potential in biomedical applications but does not engage in a critical evaluation of its limitations or compare its performance with other scaffold materials, which is essential for a comprehensive understanding of its utility.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, several papers, such as *chitosan_based_bioactive_materials_in_tissue_engineering_applications_a_review*, offer a well-structured overview of chitosan’s role in tissue engineering. However, the absence of a detailed discussion on the limitations of chitosan in certain applications—such as its low mechanical strength or poor solubility in neutral pH environments—limits the critical depth of the review. Furthermore, the paper *chitosan_based_biomaterials* emphasizes chitosan’s potential in drug and gene delivery, which, while relevant, does not align closely with the primary focus of the survey on bioactive materials in tissue engineering.\n\nIn summary, while the existing literature provides valuable insights into the use of chitosan-based materials in tissue engineering, there is a need for more comprehensive historical and comparative analyses, as well as a deeper exploration of both the advantages and limitations of chitosan in different biomedical contexts [1,2,3,4,5,6]."

      "content": "Chitosan-based bioactive materials have emerged as a promising class of scaffold materials in tissue engineering due to their inherent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ability to support cellular functions such as adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation [2,5]. These scaffolds are designed to mimic the natural extracellular matrix (ECM), providing a three-dimensional (3D) environment that facilitates tissue regeneration. The structural and functional properties of chitosan scaffolds, including porosity, surface area, degradation rate, and mechanical strength, are critical determinants of their efficacy in tissue engineering applications [2,5].\n\nThe fabrication of chitosan scaffolds is a crucial step in their development, as it directly influences their structural and functional characteristics. Electrospinning, freeze-drying, and 3D printing are among the most widely used methods, each offering distinct advantages in terms of scaffold architecture, porosity, and mechanical performance. Electrospinning produces nanofibrous structures that closely mimic the ECM, enhancing cell adhesion and proliferation, although the mechanical strength of electrospun scaffolds is often limited, necessitating the use of cross-linking agents such as glutaraldehyde or genipin to improve stability [5]. Freeze-drying enables the creation of scaffolds with highly interconnected porous networks, which are critical for cell infiltration and vascularization, with pore size and distribution controllable through adjustments in freezing conditions [3]. In contrast, 3D printing provides unparalleled design flexibility, allowing for the fabrication of scaffolds with complex geometries and tailored mechanical properties, particularly useful for patient-specific implants and the integration of multiple bioactive components [2].\n\nThe mechanical and biological properties of chitosan scaffolds are central to their application in tissue engineering. Mechanical properties such as tensile strength, elasticity, and compressive modulus are essential for scaffolds intended to support load-bearing tissues like bone and cartilage. Cross-linking agents and blending with other polymers or ceramic components have been explored to enhance mechanical performance, although the specific effects of these modifications remain underexplored in many studies [2,5]. The biological performance of chitosan scaffolds, particularly their ability to support cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation, is equally vital. Chitosan has been shown to promote osteogenic differentiation in bone tissue engineering, with evidence suggesting its suitability as a scaffold for osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells [2]. However, the extent of biological activity can vary depending on scaffold formulation, surface chemistry, and porosity, with porous scaffolds exhibiting greater extensibility but lower mechanical robustness compared to non-porous counterparts [3].\n\nThe degradation behavior of chitosan scaffolds is another key factor influencing their long-term performance. Chitosan is inherently biodegradable, and its degradation rate can be modulated through parameters such as molecular weight, degree of deacetylation, and the inclusion of other biodegradable polymers. This tunability is essential for ensuring that scaffolds degrade in sync with tissue regeneration, thus minimizing adverse immune responses. However, many studies lack quantitative data on degradation kinetics, particularly under physiological conditions, which limits the ability to predict in vivo performance [1].\n\nDespite the promising potential of chitosan scaffolds, several research gaps persist. A critical limitation is the absence of comprehensive quantitative data on mechanical performance, such as tensile strength and elasticity, which hampers the comparison of different scaffold designs. Additionally, the lack of detailed cell behavior data, including cell viability, adhesion, and proliferation, restricts the assessment of biological compatibility. Furthermore, few studies provide in vivo validation, which is essential for evaluating scaffold stability and degradation in a physiological context [1,2]. The absence of comparative studies with other scaffold materials, such as collagen or synthetic polymers, also limits the ability to assess the relative advantages and disadvantages of chitosan in different tissue engineering applications [5].\n\nTo address these challenges, future research should focus on developing more standardized and rigorous experimental protocols for evaluating both mechanical and biological properties. The integration of advanced fabrication techniques, such as 3D printing and electrospinning, may offer new opportunities for tailoring scaffold architecture, mechanical properties, and degradation behavior. These approaches could enable more precise control over scaffold design, ultimately enhancing the performance and applicability of chitosan-based bioactive materials in regenerative medicine."

The structural and functional properties of chitosan scaffolds, including porosity, surface area, degradation rate, and mechanical strength, are critical determinants of their efficacy in tissue engineering applications [2,5].\n\nSeveral studies have explored the fabrication of porous chitosan scaffolds using techniques such as controlled freezing and lyophilization. These methods enable the creation of scaffolds with a wide range of pore sizes, from 1 to 250 micrometers, which can be tailored to match the requirements of different tissue types. The porosity of the scaffold is essential for nutrient diffusion, cell infiltration, and vascularization, all of which are crucial for successful tissue regeneration [3]. Additionally, the surface of chitosan scaffolds can be modified through the incorporation of glycosaminoglycans, which form ionic complexes and enhance bioactivity [3].\n\nDespite the general consensus on the utility of chitosan as a scaffold material, some studies have noted limitations in the depth of analysis regarding specific scaffold characteristics. For instance, while certain papers emphasize the importance of scaffold design in promoting tissue regeneration, they do not provide detailed discussions on parameters such as porosity, degradation rate, or mechanical strength [1]. This gap in the literature suggests a need for more comprehensive studies that systematically evaluate the interplay between scaffold properties and biological outcomes.\n\nIn summary, chitosan-based bioactive materials offer significant potential in tissue engineering due to their structural versatility and biological compatibility. However, further research is required to optimize scaffold design and better understand the relationship between material properties and cellular responses. The development of advanced fabrication techniques, such as those involving controlled porosity and surface modification, represents a promising direction for future investigations in this field [2,3,5]."

However, several recurring limitations across the reviewed papers indicate gaps in the depth of analysis regarding both the mechanical and biological performance of chitosan scaffolds. For instance, while multiple studies acknowledge the foundational role of chitosan in tissue engineering applications, they often lack detailed exploration of the specific mechanisms by which chitosan interacts with cells, such as adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation [1,2]. This omission limits the understanding of how chitosan's structural and chemical properties translate into functional biological outcomes.\n\nMoreover, the mechanical properties of chitosan scaffolds are frequently mentioned in passing, with limited comparative analysis against other biomaterials. This is particularly evident in the paper by [1], which emphasizes the potential of chitosan scaffolds but does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of their mechanical strength or long-term stability. Such data are critical for determining the suitability of chitosan scaffolds in load-bearing applications, such as bone tissue engineering. Similarly, the paper [3] discusses fabrication methods and structural characteristics but does not elaborate on the biological performance of these scaffolds, including cell behavior or in vivo responses.\n\nIn terms of fabrication, while some studies provide an overview of methods used to create chitosan scaffolds, such as electrospinning or freeze-drying, there is a lack of specificity regarding the types of scaffolds employed and the experimental validation of their performance. This is a recurring issue across multiple papers, including [5], which highlights the importance of in vitro and in vivo testing but does not provide detailed results. As a result, the current body of literature tends to emphasize the theoretical potential of chitosan scaffolds without sufficient empirical support.\n\nDespite these limitations, the studies collectively underscore the versatility of chitosan as a scaffold material and its capacity to be modified through cross-linking, blending with other polymers, or functionalization to enhance its performance. However, the absence of a systematic comparison between different chitosan-based scaffolds and their performance relative to conventional biomaterials remains a significant gap. Future research should focus on addressing these shortcomings by conducting more rigorous experimental evaluations, including long-term stability tests, mechanical characterization, and in-depth biological assessments. This will not only strengthen the scientific foundation of chitosan-based bioactive materials but also facilitate their translation into clinical applications."

Electrospinning, freeze-drying, and 3D printing are the most widely utilized methods, each offering unique advantages in terms of scaffold architecture, porosity, and mechanical performance. Electrospinning is particularly valued for its ability to produce nanofibrous structures that closely mimic the extracellular matrix, thereby enhancing cell adhesion and proliferation. However, the mechanical strength of electrospun scaffolds is often insufficient, necessitating the use of cross-linking agents such as glutaraldehyde or genipin to improve stability, although excessive cross-linking may compromise biocompatibility and degradation behavior [5].\n\nFreeze-drying, or lyophilization, enables the creation of scaffolds with highly interconnected porous networks, which are critical for cell infiltration, nutrient diffusion, and vascularization. The porosity and pore size distribution can be precisely controlled through adjustments in freezing conditions, such as cooling rate and the use of porogens, making this technique particularly suitable for applications in bone and cartilage regeneration [3]. In contrast, 3D printing provides unparalleled design flexibility, allowing for the fabrication of scaffolds with complex geometries and tailored mechanical properties. This technique is especially promising for patient-specific implants and the integration of multiple bioactive components within a single scaffold structure [2].\n\nDespite their respective merits, each fabrication method presents distinct limitations. For instance, freeze-dried scaffolds typically exhibit higher porosity but lower mechanical strength compared to 3D-printed scaffolds, which can be engineered to have enhanced mechanical stability at the cost of reduced porosity. Furthermore, the literature often lacks comprehensive comparative analyses of these techniques, with many studies focusing on individual methods without evaluating their relative suitability for specific tissue engineering applications. This gap in the literature highlights the need for more systematic investigations that incorporate parameter optimization, scalability assessments, and comparative evaluations to guide the selection of fabrication strategies for different biomedical contexts [2,5].\n\nIn summary, the fabrication of chitosan-based scaffolds represents a critical step in the design of bioactive materials for tissue engineering. While each technique offers distinct benefits, the integration of multiple approaches—such as combining 3D printing for structural design with freeze-drying for porosity control—may provide a more holistic solution to achieving scaffolds with optimal functional properties. Future research should prioritize the development of standardized protocols, comparative studies, and scalable manufacturing processes to advance the clinical translation of chitosan-based scaffolds."

Electrospinning, freeze-drying, and 3D printing are among the most commonly reported techniques, each offering distinct advantages in terms of structural customization and functional performance [2,5]. \n\nElectrospinning is particularly effective in producing nanofibrous scaffolds that mimic the extracellular matrix, thereby promoting cell adhesion and proliferation. This technique allows for the fabrication of scaffolds with high surface-area-to-volume ratios, which is beneficial for nutrient and waste exchange in tissue engineering applications [5]. However, the mechanical strength of electrospun scaffolds is often limited, necessitating the use of cross-linking agents to enhance their stability and durability [5].\n\nFreeze-drying, also known as lyophilization, is another widely used method for fabricating porous chitosan scaffolds. This technique enables the creation of scaffolds with interconnected pores, which are essential for cell infiltration and vascularization. The pore size and distribution can be precisely controlled by adjusting the freezing conditions, such as the cooling rate and the presence of porogens [3]. The resulting scaffolds exhibit good biocompatibility and are suitable for a wide range of tissue engineering applications, including bone and cartilage regeneration.\n\nIn contrast, 3D printing offers a high degree of design flexibility, allowing for the fabrication of scaffolds with complex geometries and tailored mechanical properties. This technique is especially useful for creating patient-specific implants and for integrating multiple bioactive components within a single scaffold structure [2]. However, the resolution and precision of 3D-printed scaffolds depend heavily on the type of printer and the material formulation used, which can limit their applicability in certain contexts.\n\nThe choice of fabrication method significantly influences the final scaffold characteristics, including porosity, mechanical strength, and degradation rate. For instance, freeze-dried scaffolds tend to have higher porosity but lower mechanical strength compared to 3D-printed scaffolds, which can be engineered to have more robust mechanical properties at the expense of porosity [2]. Additionally, the use of cross-linking agents such as glutaraldehyde or genipin can further enhance the mechanical stability of chitosan scaffolds, although excessive cross-linking may reduce their biocompatibility and degradation rate [5].\n\nOverall, the development of chitosan-based bioactive materials for tissue engineering is heavily dependent on the selection and optimization of fabrication techniques. While each method has its own strengths and limitations, the combination of multiple techniques—such as using 3D printing for structural design and freeze-drying for porosity control—may offer a promising approach to achieving scaffolds with optimal functional properties."

For instance, cross-linking agents such as glutaraldehyde or genipin have been shown to significantly enhance the mechanical strength and stability of chitosan scaffolds, thereby improving their load-bearing capacity and resistance to degradation [2].\n\nIn addition to mechanical properties, the biological performance of chitosan scaffolds is equally critical. Studies have demonstrated that chitosan supports cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation, making it a promising material for tissue engineering. Notably, the ability of chitosan to promote osteogenic differentiation has been highlighted in the context of bone tissue engineering, where it serves as a suitable scaffold for osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells [2]. However, the extent to which chitosan supports these biological processes can vary depending on its formulation and surface characteristics. For example, porous chitosan membranes have been found to exhibit greater extensibility compared to non-porous counterparts, although their elastic moduli and tensile strengths are generally lower, suggesting a trade-off between porosity and mechanical robustness [3].\n\nThe degradation rate of chitosan scaffolds is another key factor influencing their performance. While chitosan is inherently biodegradable, the rate of degradation can be modulated by altering its molecular weight, degree of deacetylation, or by incorporating other biodegradable polymers. This tunability allows for the design of scaffolds that degrade in sync with the formation of new tissue, minimizing the risk of chronic inflammation or foreign body reactions. However, some studies have noted a lack of quantitative data on the specific effects of these modifications, indicating a need for more rigorous experimental validation [1].\n\nOverall, while chitosan scaffolds demonstrate significant potential in tissue engineering due to their biocompatibility and bioactivity, further research is required to systematically optimize their mechanical properties while maintaining their biological functionality. The integration of chitosan with other biomaterials and the development of advanced fabrication techniques, such as 3D printing or electrospinning, may offer promising avenues for enhancing scaffold performance. These approaches could enable the precise control of scaffold architecture, mechanical properties, and degradation behavior, thereby advancing the application of chitosan-based bioactive materials in regenerative medicine."

Multiple studies highlight that chitosan can promote osteogenesis through the activation of osteoblasts and the regulation of bone-related signaling pathways [2,5]. These mechanisms are critical for the development of bioactive scaffolds that support bone regeneration. However, the extent and specificity of these effects vary across studies. For instance, while some papers describe the activation of osteoblasts and the modulation of signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin or BMP, others remain more general in their descriptions without providing experimental validation or detailed mechanistic insights [1,5].\n\nOne key finding across several studies is the potential of chitosan to stimulate the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into osteoblasts. This process is central to bone tissue engineering, as it facilitates the formation of functional bone tissue. However, the lack of experimental evidence in certain studies limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of this effect [1]. This discrepancy suggests that while the osteoinductive potential of chitosan is broadly acknowledged, further research is needed to clarify the molecular pathways and cellular responses involved.\n\nTo enhance the osteoinductive properties of chitosan, several studies emphasize the importance of incorporating bioactive molecules or minerals, such as hydroxyapatite or growth factors, into chitosan-based scaffolds. These modifications are shown to improve the bioactivity and osteoconductivity of the material, thereby supporting more effective bone regeneration [2]. Additionally, surface modification techniques, such as cross-linking or coating with bioactive agents, have been explored to further enhance the osteoinductive capacity of chitosan. Such strategies not only improve the material's interaction with cells but also increase its stability and mechanical performance in vivo.\n\nDespite the promising findings, the field remains in need of more rigorous experimental validation, particularly in terms of in vivo studies and long-term biocompatibility assessments. While in vitro studies have demonstrated the potential of chitosan to support osteogenesis, the translation of these results into clinical applications requires further investigation. Moreover, the variability in the osteoinductive effects observed across different studies underscores the need for standardized methodologies and more comprehensive comparative analyses. Overall, chitosan-based bioactive materials represent a promising avenue in tissue engineering, but their full potential can only be realized through continued research and technological refinement."

However, their clinical translation is hindered by a range of critical challenges and limitations that must be addressed to fully realize their therapeutic potential. These challenges span multiple domains, including mechanical performance, degradation behavior, cross-linking strategies, immune responses, and clinical validation. A systematic analysis of the existing literature reveals that while numerous studies have explored these issues, there remains a lack of comprehensive experimental data, standardized testing protocols, and in vivo validation to substantiate the claims and guide future research.\n\nOne of the most prominent limitations is the insufficient mechanical strength of chitosan-based scaffolds and hydrogels, which restricts their applicability in load-bearing tissues such as bone and cartilage. The semi-crystalline structure of chitosan, combined with limited intermolecular cross-linking, results in poor tensile and compressive strength, necessitating the development of strategies such as chemical cross-linking, composite formation, and the incorporation of inorganic fillers to enhance mechanical performance [2,5]. Despite these efforts, many studies lack detailed experimental data to support the efficacy of these approaches, highlighting the need for more rigorous testing and comparative analysis of different modification techniques.\n\nIn addition to mechanical limitations, the degradation behavior of chitosan-based materials is another critical concern. The degradation rate must be precisely controlled to match the regeneration timeline of the target tissue, yet current studies often report inconsistent or uncontrolled degradation profiles. This variability can lead to either prolonged foreign body reactions or premature loss of structural support, complicating the design of effective scaffolds. Strategies such as chemical modifications, cross-linking, and the use of degradation-controlling agents are being explored, but the absence of standardized degradation testing protocols limits the ability to evaluate their effectiveness across different applications [2,5].\n\nAnother key challenge is the limited control over cross-linking methods, which can significantly affect the structural and functional properties of chitosan-based materials. While chemical cross-linking agents such as glutaraldehyde, genipin, and epichlorohydrin have been shown to improve mechanical stability, they often result in heterogeneous structures that may hinder cell infiltration and tissue integration. Alternative approaches, such as enzymatic or photo-cross-linking, are being investigated as more precise and tunable methods, but their widespread application remains limited by technical and practical constraints [5].\n\nBiological and clinical limitations further complicate the use of chitosan-based materials. While chitosan is generally considered biocompatible, some studies suggest that its degradation products or residual impurities may trigger inflammatory or immune responses in vivo, particularly in long-term implantation scenarios [5]. The variability in cellular responses to chitosan-based scaffolds also presents a major obstacle to standardization, as different cell types exhibit divergent behaviors, leading to inconsistent outcomes across experimental models. Additionally, the limited bioactivity of chitosan in vivo, particularly in terms of sustaining prolonged cell growth and tissue regeneration, remains a significant challenge for its application in tissue engineering [2].\n\nTo address these limitations, future research should focus on optimizing chitosan’s properties through advanced material design, including chemical modifications, composite formulations, and the development of more precise and tunable cross-linking techniques. Furthermore, there is a pressing need for more in vivo and clinical studies to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and long-term performance of chitosan-based materials in complex physiological environments. Current research is largely confined to in vitro experiments and animal models, which may not fully reflect human biological conditions. By bridging this translational gap, researchers can provide the empirical evidence necessary to support the clinical implementation of chitosan-based bioactive materials in regenerative medicine."

The development of smart scaffolds capable of responding to environmental stimuli, such as pH or temperature, has also been proposed as a key area for innovation, aligning with the broader goals of personalized medicine and dynamic tissue regeneration [5].\n\nHowever, the future directions outlined in the reviewed papers often lack specificity and concrete experimental frameworks. Many studies emphasize the potential of chitosan-based materials without providing detailed pathways for technological integration or clinical validation. For instance, while the incorporation of nanomaterials, growth factors, or synthetic polymers is frequently suggested, few studies offer comprehensive protocols for their implementation or long-term stability assessment [2,4]. Similarly, the development of stimuli-responsive systems and 3D bioprinted constructs is acknowledged as a promising direction, but the lack of standardized methodologies and in vivo testing remains a major barrier to their practical application [5].\n\nTo bridge this gap, future research should prioritize the development of advanced fabrication techniques, including 3D bioprinting and microfluidic systems, to enable precise control over scaffold architecture and functionality. Additionally, the integration of multifunctional components—such as bioactive agents, antimicrobial peptides, or drug delivery systems—should be explored in greater depth to enhance the therapeutic potential of chitosan-based materials. Furthermore, the establishment of standardized protocols for in vivo evaluation and clinical translation is essential to ensure the reproducibility and reliability of future studies. By addressing these challenges, the field can move closer to realizing the full potential of chitosan-based bioactive materials in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine."

Recent studies emphasize the potential of these materials in developing advanced scaffolds, bioactive coatings, and smart delivery systems, with a particular focus on their application in bone tissue engineering and personalized medicine [5]. However, while the versatility of chitosan is well-documented, several challenges remain in optimizing its performance for clinical use.\n\nOne of the primary areas of focus in current research is the enhancement of mechanical properties, which are often insufficient for load-bearing applications. For instance, chitosan-based hydrogels, despite their favorable biological properties, require further improvement in terms of elasticity and strength to meet the demands of tissue engineering scaffolds [4]. This has led to a growing interest in cross-linking strategies, such as the use of chemical cross-linkers or physical methods, to increase the stability and durability of chitosan-based constructs. Additionally, the integration of chitosan with other biomaterials, such as nanomaterials, growth factors, or synthetic polymers, has been proposed as a viable approach to overcome these limitations and improve functional performance [2].\n\nAnother critical aspect is the development of smart scaffolds that can respond to environmental stimuli, such as pH, temperature, or mechanical stress, thereby enabling controlled drug release or cell signaling. This aligns with the broader vision of personalized medicine, where chitosan-based materials can be tailored to specific patient needs and tissue regeneration requirements [5]. However, while several studies have explored the design of such systems, the translation of these concepts into clinical practice remains limited due to a lack of comprehensive in vivo validation and standardization protocols [4].\n\nMoreover, the biological performance of chitosan-based materials, particularly in terms of cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation, has been a subject of extensive investigation. While some studies report promising results, others highlight the need for further optimization to ensure consistent and reproducible outcomes. For example, the incorporation of bioactive agents, such as growth factors or antibiotics, has been shown to enhance the osteogenic potential of chitosan scaffolds, but the long-term stability and controlled release of these agents remain areas of concern [2].\n\nIn summary, while chitosan-based bioactive materials offer a promising platform for tissue engineering, their full potential is yet to be realized. Future research should prioritize the development of advanced fabrication techniques, the integration of multifunctional components, and the conduct of rigorous in vivo studies to bridge the gap between laboratory findings and clinical application [5]."

      "content": "The future directions discussed in the reviewed papers on chitosan-based bioactive materials generally emphasize the need for more concrete and specific research pathways. While several studies acknowledge the potential of chitosan in tissue engineering, they often fall short in providing detailed experimental approaches or innovative strategies for further development [2,4,5]. For instance, the paper on chitosan-based scaffolds for bone tissue engineering highlights the importance of future research but lacks specific examples of technological integration, such as 3D bioprinting or smart drug delivery systems, which could significantly enhance the functionality of chitosan-based scaffolds [2]. Similarly, the review on chitosan-based hydrogels calls for more targeted recommendations, including the development of hybrid hydrogels and the incorporation of stimuli-responsive properties, which would broaden their applicability in biomedical contexts [4].\n\nThe section on future directions in the general review of chitosan-based bioactive materials is described as being too brief and lacking specific research priorities. It fails to address the challenges of clinical translation, which is a critical step in moving from laboratory findings to practical applications [5]. This gap is echoed in another paper, which notes that the future directions are too generic and do not offer a clear roadmap for advancing the field, particularly in terms of material design and fabrication techniques [1].\n\nIn summary, while the existing literature acknowledges the potential of chitosan-based materials, the future directions sections across the reviewed papers are largely conceptual and lack the specificity needed to guide experimental research. A more detailed exploration of emerging technologies, such as 3D bioprinting, smart drug delivery systems, and advanced fabrication methods, would significantly strengthen the future research agenda. Additionally, addressing the challenges of clinical translation and developing hybrid or multifunctional chitosan-based systems could serve as key priorities for the next phase of research in this field."
