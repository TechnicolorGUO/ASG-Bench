      "level": 2,
      "content": "The development of upper limb exoskeletons has been driven by a diverse set of motivations, reflecting the multifaceted applications of these devices across clinical, industrial, and assistive domains. A significant portion of the research focuses on rehabilitation, particularly for patients with neurological impairments such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. For instance, the paper titled *upper_body_robotic_exoskeleton* emphasizes the need for exoskeletons that facilitate task-specific motor practice outside clinical settings, enabling continuous and intensive rehabilitation. Similarly, [5,7] address the decline in musculoskeletal strength due to aging and stroke, highlighting the importance of intention-driven augmentation to support daily upper limb tasks.\n\nIn contrast, other studies emphasize industrial applications, particularly in high-risk environments such as construction. The paper *designing_and_prototyping_a_smart_upper_limb_exoskeleton_for_enhancing_wellbeing_and_productivity_in_construction* identifies the high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among construction workers as a key motivation for developing exoskeletons that reduce physical strain during heavy lifting and repetitive tasks. This reflects a shift in focus from purely therapeutic applications to performance enhancement and occupational safety.\n\nDespite these divergent motivations, a common thread across many studies is the emphasis on user-centric design. Papers such as *exoskeleton_motors_power_breakthroughs_in_upper_limb_technology* and *upper_limb_exoskeleton_design* stress the importance of lightweight, ergonomic, and comfortable exoskeletons that improve user experience and reduce fatigue. This aligns with the broader goal of enhancing the usability and effectiveness of upper limb exoskeletons in both clinical and industrial contexts. Moreover, the integration of advanced control systems, such as soft bioelectronics and deep learning algorithms, is a recurring theme, as seen in [5,7], which aim to achieve real-time, intuitive assistance based on user intent.\n\nThe overlapping goals of improving rehabilitation outcomes, enhancing human performance, and ensuring user comfort underscore the interdisciplinary nature of upper limb exoskeleton research. However, the varying priorities—whether centered on clinical rehabilitation, industrial productivity, or assistive living—highlight the need for a comprehensive review that synthesizes these diverse perspectives. By examining the motivations and objectives of existing studies, this survey aims to provide a structured overview of the field, identifying common challenges and opportunities for future research."

      "content": "The classification of upper limb exoskeletons varies across the literature, with different studies emphasizing distinct criteria such as actuation type, mechanical design, degrees of freedom, and functional role. While some papers adopt a structured approach, categorizing exoskeletons based on their kinematic configuration and actuation mechanism, others focus on application-specific classifications, such as assistive, rehabilitative, or augmentative functions. For example, [6] provides a classification framework based on degrees of freedom, actuation type, and structural design, highlighting the importance of these factors in determining the functionality and usability of the exoskeleton. In contrast, [3] offers a more general classification, emphasizing structural design and human-robot interaction without delving into detailed subcategories. This variation in classification methods leads to discrepancies in how exoskeletons are categorized, complicating the development of a unified taxonomy.\n\nA common classification criterion is actuation type, with electric, pneumatic, and hybrid systems being widely discussed. Electric actuators are favored for their precision and controllability, making them suitable for rehabilitation and fine motor assistance [6], while pneumatic actuators are valued for their compliance and safety in assistive applications [4]. Hybrid systems, which integrate both electric and pneumatic components, have emerged as a promising solution to balance precision and compliance, though they introduce additional complexity in control and energy management [4,6].\n\nAnother prevalent classification is based on structural design, distinguishing between rigid and soft exoskeletons. Rigid designs often employ mechanical linkages and are suitable for high-force applications, whereas soft exoskeletons prioritize user comfort and flexibility, as seen in the garment-like structure described in [2]. This classification aligns with the functional roles of the exoskeletons, such as assistive, rehabilitative, or augmentative, with each application influencing the choice of design and actuation method.\n\nDespite the existence of multiple classification schemes, there remains a lack of consensus on a standardized taxonomy. Some studies, such as [6], provide a more comprehensive classification, while others, like [3], offer only a general overview. This inconsistency highlights the need for a more unified and systematic classification framework that accounts for both technical and functional aspects of upper limb exoskeletons.\n\nIn terms of advantages and disadvantages, classification based on actuation type offers clarity in understanding performance characteristics but may overlook the interplay between design and application. Structural classification provides insight into user comfort and mechanical feasibility but may not fully capture the dynamic control aspects. Functional classification is useful for application-oriented design but may lack technical depth. Future research should aim to develop a multi-dimensional classification system that integrates actuation, structure, and function, while addressing the limitations of current approaches. This would facilitate more accurate comparisons between exoskeleton designs and support the development of more effective and user-centered systems."

      "level": 3,
      "content": "Actuation systems play a crucial role in determining the performance, usability, and applicability of upper limb exoskeletons. A comparative analysis of the actuation methods described in various studies reveals distinct advantages and limitations associated with electric, pneumatic, and hybrid systems. Electric actuators are frequently highlighted for their precision and controllability, making them suitable for tasks requiring high accuracy, such as rehabilitation or fine motor assistance [6]. However, their relatively high power consumption and limited compliance may pose challenges in applications where user safety and adaptability are critical.\n\nIn contrast, pneumatic actuators are valued for their inherent compliance and ability to provide safe human-robot interaction, which is particularly important in assistive and wearable systems [6]. Pneumatic systems, such as Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs), are also noted for their lightweight characteristics, which contribute to improved portability and user comfort [4]. However, their lower precision and slower response times can limit their effectiveness in tasks requiring fine control.\n\nHybrid actuation systems have emerged as a promising solution to overcome the limitations of single-actuator configurations. These systems integrate electric motors and pneumatic actuators, combining the precision of electric components with the compliance and safety of pneumatic ones [4]. This approach is particularly advantageous in applications where both high torque and adaptability are required, such as in assistive exoskeletons for individuals with motor impairments. However, hybrid systems introduce additional complexity in control strategies and energy management, which can increase system weight and reduce overall efficiency [6].\n\nSeveral studies emphasize the importance of actuation choice in relation to specific design objectives, such as portability, user safety, and task requirements. For instance, one paper describes a \"plug and play\" actuation system that is likely based on electric actuators, with a focus on compactness and ease of use [2]. Another study highlights the integration of tendon-based systems driven by actuation mechanisms, though the specific type of actuation is not explicitly stated, suggesting a possible preference for electric or hybrid solutions [2].\n\nDespite the growing interest in hybrid systems, the literature indicates that electric and pneumatic actuators remain the most commonly used, with their selection often dictated by the intended application. Electric actuators are preferred in scenarios requiring high precision and repeatability, while pneumatic systems are favored in applications where safety and adaptability are paramount. Hybrid systems, although promising, are still in the experimental phase and require further optimization to address control complexity and energy efficiency issues.\n\nIn terms of trends, there is a clear shift toward more integrated and user-centric designs, where actuation systems are not only evaluated based on technical performance but also on their impact on user experience and long-term usability. Best practices for actuator selection suggest that designers should carefully consider the trade-offs between precision, compliance, weight, and energy efficiency, while also aligning the choice with the specific functional requirements of the exoskeleton. Future research should focus on developing more efficient hybrid systems and improving the control algorithms that enable seamless integration of multiple actuation types."

      "level": 3,
      "content": "Pneumatic-electric hybrid actuators have emerged as a promising solution for upper limb exoskeletons, offering a balance between the high-force output of pneumatic actuators and the precision of electric actuators. Studies such as [4] demonstrate that the integration of Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs) with small electromagnetic motors enables the system to achieve both compliance and accuracy. This combination is particularly advantageous in applications where human-robot interaction requires backdrivability, as the PAMs provide inherent compliance, while the electric motors compensate for the dynamic uncertainties associated with PAMs and Bowden cables.  \n\nHowever, the hybrid approach introduces significant challenges in terms of control complexity and energy efficiency. The paper [4] explicitly notes that the coordination between pneumatic and electric components demands advanced control strategies, which can increase the computational load and system latency. Additionally, the energy consumption of hybrid systems is often higher than that of purely electric or purely pneumatic systems, as both actuation types require separate power sources and control mechanisms.  \n\nComparative analyses between hybrid systems and traditional actuation methods reveal distinct trade-offs. While purely electric actuators offer high precision and ease of control, they are generally less compliant and may not provide the necessary force for tasks requiring significant strength. On the other hand, purely pneumatic systems excel in compliance and force generation but lack the fine control and responsiveness required for complex human-robot interactions. The hybrid system, therefore, represents a middle ground, combining the strengths of both actuation types to meet the multifaceted demands of upper limb exoskeletons.  \n\nThe paper [6] further emphasizes the design challenges inherent in hybrid actuation, particularly in achieving stable control and maintaining energy efficiency. The authors highlight that the integration of pneumatic and electric components requires careful consideration of mechanical coupling, sensor feedback, and power distribution. Despite these challenges, the potential of hybrid actuation in future exoskeleton designs remains substantial, especially in applications that require both adaptability and strength, such as rehabilitation, assistive robotics, and industrial exoskeletons.  \n\nIn summary, while pneumatic-electric hybrid actuators offer enhanced performance in terms of compliance and precision, their implementation is constrained by increased system complexity and energy inefficiency. Future research should focus on optimizing control algorithms, improving energy management, and developing more compact and efficient hybrid configurations to fully realize the potential of this actuation approach."

Check the syntax correctness and parenthesis integrity of the formula to ensure that it can be rendered by KaTeX, and convert the expressions involving other macro packages into expressions supported by KaTeX.\n\n\nBowden cables have been increasingly explored in the design of upper limb exoskeletons due to their inherent advantages, such as lightweight and flexibility, which make them suitable for applications requiring minimal force transmission. Several studies, including [4,6], emphasize these characteristics, highlighting their utility in low-force assistive systems. For instance, [6] notes that Bowden cables are particularly effective in passive assistance systems, where the primary requirement is to provide gentle, non-intrusive support rather than high-precision actuation. Similarly, [4] integrates Bowden cables into a hybrid actuation system, leveraging their flexibility to reduce system inertia and improve user comfort.  \n\nHowever, the integration of Bowden cables is not without challenges. Both [4,6] identify key limitations, such as friction, wear, and reduced precision over time. These issues are particularly problematic in high-precision applications, where accurate force or motion control is essential. The friction within the cable sheath can introduce nonlinearities in the force transmission, leading to inconsistent performance, especially under repeated or prolonged use. This suggests that while Bowden cables are well-suited for passive or low-force assistive devices, their application in more demanding scenarios—such as active rehabilitation or high-accuracy robotic assistance—may require additional compensation mechanisms or alternative transmission methods.  \n\nIn terms of integration with other components, Bowden cables are often paired with actuators, such as pneumatic actuators or hybrid systems, to facilitate force transmission. For example, in [4], Bowden cables are used to connect the pneumatic actuators (PAMs) to the joint mechanisms, enabling a compact and lightweight design. This integration demonstrates the potential of Bowden cables to simplify the mechanical layout of exoskeletons, reducing the need for complex gear systems or rigid linkages. However, the effectiveness of such integration depends on the specific application requirements. In systems where high precision and dynamic control are critical, the limitations of Bowden cables may necessitate the use of alternative transmission technologies, such as direct-drive actuators or belt-driven systems.  \n\nOverall, the use of Bowden cables in upper limb exoskeletons is most effective in applications that prioritize weight reduction, flexibility, and simplicity. These systems are particularly well-suited for passive or low-force assistive devices, where the trade-offs in precision and durability are acceptable. However, for high-precision or high-force applications, the inherent limitations of Bowden cables may restrict their utility unless complemented by advanced control strategies or hybrid actuation schemes. Future research should focus on mitigating the friction and wear issues associated with Bowden cables, potentially through improved materials or lubrication techniques, to expand their applicability in more demanding exoskeleton designs."

      "content": "Control strategies in upper limb exoskeletons vary significantly, with different approaches tailored to specific application scenarios and user needs. Impedance control, which focuses on regulating the interaction forces between the exoskeleton and the user, is highlighted in several studies as a method to achieve natural movement and adaptability. For instance, the paper on upper limb exoskeleton design emphasizes the importance of real-time feedback for user adaptation and discusses the use of EMG sensors, force/torque sensors, and IMUs for monitoring user intent and movement [6]. This aligns with the broader trend of integrating multimodal sensing to enhance control responsiveness and accuracy.\n\nIn contrast, some studies emphasize EMG-based control for personalized assistance. The paper on the intelligent upper limb exoskeleton integrated with soft bioelectronics and deep learning for intention-driven augmentation employs soft wearable sensors to collect real-time muscle activity data, which is then processed by a cloud-based deep learning model to predict human intention with an accuracy of 96.2% and a response rate of 200–250 milliseconds [5]. This approach not only improves the accuracy of movement prediction but also enhances the user experience by enabling the exoskeleton to respond to user intent without manual input. Similarly, another study on an intelligent upper limb exoskeleton with soft wearable bioelectronics and deep learning for human intention-driven strength augmentation based on sensory feedback also demonstrates the effectiveness of EMG-based control, achieving comparable performance metrics [7].\n\nAnother notable control strategy is the use of feedforward controllers for active gravity compensation. The paper on exoskeleton motors power breakthroughs in upper limb technology presents a model-based feedforward approach that reduces reliance on complex adaptive control algorithms, thereby improving real-time performance and reducing user effort [8]. This method is particularly effective in applications where predictable forces, such as gravitational loads, dominate, and it demonstrates how simplified control strategies can be optimized for specific tasks.\n\nIn addition to these methods, some studies explore multimodal control systems that combine different sensing modalities. The paper on designing and prototyping a smart upper limb exoskeleton for enhancing wellbeing and productivity in construction integrates data from inertial measurement units (IMUs) and a wireless camera to predict user intentions and provide adaptive task support, achieving a classification accuracy of 99% [1]. This approach highlights the potential of combining multiple sensor inputs to improve the reliability and adaptability of control systems, especially in dynamic environments.\n\nWhile several studies focus on advanced control strategies, others emphasize the importance of force sensing for maintaining commanded joint orientations. The upper body robotic exoskeleton employs force sensing to enable optimal control, allowing for both active and passive assist modes. However, the paper does not explicitly discuss impedance control or adaptive control, which limits its applicability in more complex or variable environments [2].\n\nDespite the progress in control and sensing technologies, challenges remain in achieving robust and responsive systems that can adapt to individual user variability. The paper on the development of an upper limb exoskeleton powered via pneumatic-electric hybrid actuators with Bowden cable mentions the use of a goniometer for torque input but lacks detailed information on the control strategies or sensor types employed, indicating a gap in the literature regarding the integration of advanced control methods [4].\n\nIn summary, the most effective control approaches appear to be those that integrate multimodal sensing with advanced algorithms, such as deep learning, to achieve high accuracy and real-time responsiveness. While impedance control and EMG-based control offer promising solutions, the development of adaptive and user-specific control strategies remains a critical area for future research. The integration of cloud-based processing and real-time feedback mechanisms further enhances the potential of these systems, but challenges in sensor fusion, computational efficiency, and user variability must be addressed to ensure widespread applicability."

Check the syntax correctness and parenthesis integrity of the formula to ensure that it can be rendered by KaTeX, and convert the expressions involving other macro packages into expressions supported by KaTeX.\n\n\nUser-centric design has emerged as a critical factor in the development of upper limb exoskeletons, with several studies emphasizing the importance of ergonomic design, user comfort, and adaptability. The literature consistently highlights that successful exoskeleton systems must align with human physiological and cognitive characteristics to ensure long-term usability and acceptance. For instance, the paper titled *upper_limb_exoskeleton_design* underscores the necessity of incorporating user feedback mechanisms and evaluation methods such as usability testing and subjective satisfaction surveys to refine system performance and enhance user experience [6]. Similarly, *designing_and_prototyping_a_smart_upper_limb_exoskeleton_for_enhancing_wellbeing_and_productivity_in_construction* adopts user-centered design principles, employing anthropometric and 3D body scanning techniques to tailor the exoskeleton to diverse body types, thereby promoting inclusivity and comfort [1].\n\nDespite these efforts, the integration of user feedback into the design process remains a challenge. While some studies, such as *a_review_on_design_of_upper_limb_exoskeletons*, acknowledge the significance of human–robot interaction (HRI) and user-centered design, they do not provide detailed insights into how user feedback is systematically incorporated or how specific evaluation methods are applied to measure usability and satisfaction [3]. This gap is also evident in *upper_body_robotic_exoskeleton*, which describes a design that prioritizes comfort through a soft structure and adjustable components but lacks explicit discussion on user evaluation methodologies or feedback mechanisms [2].\n\nIn contrast, *development_of_an_upper_limb_exoskeleton_powered_via_pneumatic_electric_hybrid_actuators_with_bowden_cable* does not address user-centered design principles at all, focusing instead on mechanical and actuation aspects without considering user interaction or satisfaction metrics [4]. This highlights a significant disparity in the literature, where some studies prioritize user-centric approaches while others overlook them entirely.\n\nThe effectiveness of user evaluation methods varies across studies. Usability testing and subjective satisfaction surveys, as outlined in *upper_limb_exoskeleton_design*, provide valuable qualitative insights into user experience, but they may lack the quantitative rigor needed for comprehensive system optimization. On the other hand, the use of anthropometric data in *designing_and_prototyping_a_smart_upper_limb_exoskeleton_for_enhancing_wellbeing_and_productivity_in_construction* offers a more objective basis for design customization, yet it still lacks detailed feedback loops for iterative improvement.\n\nCommon challenges in achieving user satisfaction include the difficulty of balancing mechanical performance with user comfort, the complexity of integrating adaptive control systems, and the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks. These challenges are compounded by the variability in user needs, particularly in applications such as construction and rehabilitation, where exoskeletons must accommodate diverse physical conditions and operational requirements.\n\nBased on the analysis of the literature, several guidelines can be proposed for user-centered exoskeleton development. First, future studies should prioritize the integration of user feedback mechanisms throughout the design and development lifecycle, ensuring that user needs are continuously addressed. Second, standardized and multi-modal evaluation methods—combining both quantitative and qualitative data—should be adopted to provide a more holistic understanding of user satisfaction and system performance. Finally, greater emphasis should be placed on adaptive control systems that can dynamically adjust to user behavior and environmental conditions, thereby enhancing both usability and long-term adoption."

      "content": "Upper limb exoskeletons have demonstrated a wide range of applications across diverse domains, including post-stroke rehabilitation, industrial assistance, and daily living support. These devices are tailored to meet the specific needs of their intended users, leading to distinct design requirements and performance metrics. For instance, in the context of post-stroke rehabilitation, several studies emphasize the importance of task-specific therapy and user-centered design. The exoskeleton described in [5,7] is designed to assist individuals with motor impairments, offering force augmentation up to 897 newtons and reducing human muscle activity by 3.7 times. These systems are primarily deployed in clinical settings, where precise and consistent assistance is critical for effective rehabilitation.\n\nIn contrast, industrial applications focus on enhancing worker productivity and safety, particularly in physically demanding environments such as construction. The EXOCON exoskeleton, as described in [1], is specifically engineered for heavy lifting tasks, demonstrating significant reductions in biceps muscle strain. While this application prioritizes strength augmentation and ergonomic support, it does not emphasize the same level of adaptability or user feedback mechanisms as seen in rehabilitation systems. The design of industrial exoskeletons often emphasizes robustness, durability, and ease of use in dynamic, unstructured environments, which contrasts with the need for high precision and personalized control in clinical settings.\n\nDespite these differences, there is a growing recognition of the potential for multi-domain use. The upper-body robotic exoskeleton discussed in [2] exemplifies this versatility, with applications spanning rehabilitation, daily living assistance, human performance augmentation, and even space exploration. The device’s portability and adaptability make it suitable for non-clinical environments, highlighting the potential for cross-domain applications. Similarly, the review in [3] and the design analysis in [6] note that upper limb exoskeletons are increasingly being developed with modular and scalable architectures, enabling their deployment in multiple contexts.\n\nCommon challenges across applications include varying user needs, environmental constraints, and the need for user-specific customization. For example, rehabilitation systems must account for individual patient conditions and progress, while industrial exoskeletons must function reliably in unpredictable work environments. Additionally, the integration of advanced control systems, such as those based on deep learning and sensory feedback, is a shared priority among many studies, as it enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of the devices. However, the lack of standardized performance metrics, as noted in [4,6], remains a challenge in evaluating the efficacy of these systems across different applications.\n\nOverall, the diversity of applications underscores the versatility of upper limb exoskeletons and their potential to address a broad spectrum of user needs. While design requirements vary significantly depending on the domain, the underlying goal of enhancing human performance and improving quality of life remains consistent. As research progresses, the development of more adaptable, cost-effective, and user-centric systems will be crucial in expanding the impact of upper limb exoskeletons across multiple fields."

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The development of upper limb exoskeletons faces a range of technological challenges that vary in severity and prevalence depending on the application and design objectives. A recurring theme across multiple studies is the challenge of power efficiency, which is critical for ensuring prolonged operation without frequent recharging or external power sources. This issue is explicitly mentioned in several papers, including those discussing the EXOCON prototype [1] and the general design considerations of upper limb exoskeletons [3,6]. The need for energy-efficient actuators and control systems is further emphasized in the context of hybrid actuation, where pneumatic and electric systems must be balanced to optimize performance while minimizing power consumption [4].\n\nAnother significant challenge is the trade-off between system complexity and user comfort. Several studies highlight that increasing the sophistication of control systems or the number of degrees of freedom often leads to increased weight and reduced portability, which can negatively impact user experience [2,8]. This trade-off is particularly evident in systems that integrate advanced features such as soft bioelectronics and deep learning for intention-driven augmentation, where the integration of complex sensors and computational models may compromise the lightweight and flexible nature of the exoskeleton [5,7].\n\nReal-time control and responsiveness are also critical limitations, especially in applications requiring dynamic interaction with the user. The inability of current control systems to handle unpredictable movements or provide timely assistance is a common concern, with some studies suggesting that feedforward control strategies, while promising, still require refinement for broader applicability [8]. Additionally, the reliance on cloud-based computation for intention prediction and sensor feedback introduces latency and dependency on network infrastructure, which can limit the usability of these systems in real-world environments [7].\n\nUser adaptability and system portability are further challenges that are frequently cited. While some prototypes, such as the upper body robotic exoskeleton mentioned in the literature, have reached Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, indicating a subsystem prototype demonstration in a relevant environment, they still require significant development for commercialization [2]. The lack of adaptability to different user physiologies and varying task scenarios is a recurring issue, with several studies emphasizing the need for more personalized and context-aware systems [7].\n\nIn terms of prevalence, challenges related to power efficiency, real-time control, and user comfort appear to be the most widely reported across the literature. However, the severity of these challenges can vary depending on the specific application. For instance, in industrial settings where prolonged use is required, power efficiency and system durability may be the most pressing concerns, whereas in medical or assistive applications, user adaptability and comfort may take precedence. The need for a balanced approach that integrates performance, comfort, and cost remains a key area for future research, as noted in several design reviews and system evaluations [3,6].\n\nOverall, while significant progress has been made in upper limb exoskeleton technology, the identified challenges suggest that further innovation is needed in control strategies, actuation systems, and user-centric design. Future research should focus on developing more efficient, adaptive, and user-friendly systems that can overcome the limitations currently hindering widespread adoption."

These areas are frequently cited across multiple studies, suggesting a consensus on their potential to enhance performance, user comfort, and adaptability. For instance, several papers emphasize the integration of machine learning-based adaptive control to improve system responsiveness and personalization [6,7,8]. Such approaches enable real-time adaptation to user intent and environmental conditions, thereby increasing the exoskeleton's effectiveness in dynamic tasks.\n\nSoft robotics is another prominent direction, with studies suggesting that the use of flexible, compliant materials can significantly improve user comfort and natural interaction with the device [3,5,6]. The incorporation of soft robotic elements allows for more ergonomic designs that conform to the user’s anatomy, reducing the risk of injury and increasing wearability. This aligns with the growing interest in wearable technologies that prioritize human-centric design principles.\n\nThe role of bio-sensors and machine learning in enhancing system performance is also a recurring theme. These technologies enable more accurate interpretation of user intent through multimodal sensory feedback, which is crucial for applications requiring precise control, such as rehabilitation or industrial assistance [7,8]. However, while the general potential of these technologies is acknowledged, some reviews note a lack of specific, actionable strategies for implementation, indicating a gap in translating theoretical concepts into practical solutions [2,3].\n\nIn terms of feasibility, AI-driven control and soft robotics appear to be the most promising directions. AI offers a clear path for improving adaptability and autonomy, while soft robotics addresses critical usability concerns. However, both areas face challenges, such as computational complexity, sensor reliability, and the need for robust training data. Moreover, the integration of these technologies often requires interdisciplinary collaboration, involving fields such as computer science, materials engineering, and biomedical engineering.\n\nAnother important direction is the reduction of dependency on cloud infrastructure, with some studies advocating for decentralized or edge-based computing solutions to enhance real-time performance and reliability [5,7]. This shift is particularly relevant for applications in remote or resource-constrained environments, where latency and connectivity issues can hinder system performance.\n\nDespite these advancements, some studies highlight the need for more concrete research plans and experimental validation. For example, while the development of hybrid actuation systems is suggested as a future research area, the specific challenges related to Bowden cables and control mechanisms remain underexplored [4].\n\nIn summary, the future of upper limb exoskeleton design is likely to be shaped by the convergence of AI, soft robotics, and advanced materials. These areas offer substantial potential for improving performance, usability, and adaptability. However, to fully realize this potential, further research is needed to address technical challenges, validate theoretical models, and develop practical implementations. Interdisciplinary collaboration will be essential in advancing the field and ensuring that exoskeleton technologies meet the diverse needs of users in various applications."
