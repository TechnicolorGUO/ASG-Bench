      "content": "The problem of named entity recognition (NER) in biomedical texts is widely recognized as a critical challenge in biomedical text mining, with significant implications for downstream tasks such as relation extraction, knowledge base construction, and drug-drug interaction analysis [7]. The papers under consideration—[1,2,7]—each frame the issue of NER in biomedical texts through distinct yet overlapping perspectives, highlighting common challenges such as data scarcity, domain specificity, and the need for specialized models.\n\nOne of the central motivations across these works is the recognition of the limitations of traditional natural language processing (NLP) methods in handling the complexity and domain-specific language of biomedical texts. For instance, the paper titled *pre_trained_language_models_in_biomedical_domain_a_systematic_survey* emphasizes that general-purpose pre-trained language models (PLMs) often struggle with biomedical terminology, ambiguity, and the lack of annotated data, which hinders their effectiveness in tasks like NER [2]. Similarly, *a_comparative_study_of_pre_trained_language_models_for_named_entity_recognition_in_clinical_trial_eligibility_criteria_from_multiple_corpora* points out that while BERT and its variants have shown promise in other biomedical tasks, their application to clinical trial eligibility criteria (EC) NER remains underexplored, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptations [1].\n\nData scarcity is another recurring theme. The paper *biomedical_named_entity_recognition_with_the_combined_feature_attention_and_fully_shared_multi_task_learning* explicitly notes that existing BioNER systems suffer from a lack of high-quality and large-scale annotated data and relevant external knowledge, which limits their performance and generalization capabilities [7]. This challenge is echoed in other studies, such as *pre_trained_language_models_in_biomedical_domain_a_systematic_survey*, which highlights the need for standardized terminology and benchmarking to address the fragmented landscape of biomedical NLP research [2].\n\nIn response to these challenges, the papers collectively argue for the development of specialized models tailored to the biomedical domain. The authors of *biomedical_named_entity_recognition_with_the_combined_feature_attention_and_fully_shared_multi_task_learning* propose a fully-shared multi-task learning model that integrates syntactic information through an attention module, aiming to improve BioNER performance by leveraging domain-specific features [7]. Meanwhile, *pre_trained_language_models_in_biomedical_domain_a_systematic_survey* emphasizes the importance of domain-adapted models and calls for a structured comparison of existing approaches to facilitate further research and development [2].\n\nThe overarching rationale for this survey is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the motivations and challenges in biomedical NER, with a focus on the role of pre-trained language models in addressing these issues. The papers collectively underscore the transformative potential of PLMs in biomedical text mining, particularly in tasks like NER, where their ability to capture domain-specific language patterns and contextual dependencies can significantly enhance performance. However, they also highlight the need for continued research into domain adaptation, model generalization, and the development of robust benchmarks to ensure that these models can effectively address the unique demands of biomedical texts."

      "content": "The evolution of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in the biomedical natural language processing (NLP) domain reflects a significant shift from general-domain models to domain-specific architectures, driven by the need for enhanced performance on specialized tasks such as biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER), relation extraction, and clinical text understanding. Early models, such as BERT and BART, demonstrated strong foundational capabilities in general NLP tasks, but their effectiveness in the biomedical domain was limited by the mismatch between their training data and the specialized linguistic patterns of biomedical texts [3,4]. In response, domain-specific models like BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, and PubMedBERT were developed, each employing tailored pre-training strategies and training data to better align with the unique characteristics of biomedical and clinical language [2,5].\n\nBioBERT, based on the BERT architecture, is pre-trained on extensive biomedical corpora, including PubMed abstracts and PubMed Central full-text articles, and retains the original BERT vocabulary and tokenization scheme to ensure compatibility with existing tools and frameworks. PubMedBERT, by contrast, is trained from scratch on biomedical text with a custom vocabulary and whole-word masking, which may better capture the semantic nuances of biomedical terminology. These differences highlight the trade-offs between domain adaptation and interoperability. ClinicalBERT, another domain-specific model, is trained on clinical texts such as electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical notes, making it particularly effective for tasks involving clinical language, such as NER and relation extraction [2,5].\n\nThe integration of external knowledge sources has also emerged as a critical factor in improving the performance of PLMs in biomedical NLP. For instance, some studies have incorporated syntactic information through attention mechanisms to enhance the recognition of biomedical entities [7]. Additionally, multi-task learning (MTL) strategies have been explored to leverage shared representations across related tasks, potentially improving model generalization and reducing the need for task-specific tuning [7]. Transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies further contribute to the adaptability of these models, with task-specific heads and domain-specific fine-tuning playing a key role in aligning model outputs with the requirements of biomedical NER and other tasks [1].\n\nWhile domain-specific models have demonstrated superior performance on biomedical tasks, their effectiveness is contingent upon the quality and relevance of the training data, as well as the alignment of their pre-training objectives with the target tasks. For example, PubMedBERT has shown strong performance on NER tasks in clinical trial eligibility criteria, underscoring the importance of domain-aligned training data in enhancing model generalization and accuracy [1]. Similarly, the systematic survey on pre-trained language models in the biomedical domain reports that BioBERT and ClinicalBERT achieve higher F1-scores and accuracy on specific biomedical corpora compared to general-purpose models, further highlighting the benefits of domain-specific pre-training [2].\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain, including the limited availability of annotated biomedical data, the variability in model performance across tasks, and the need for more systematic approaches to integrating external knowledge and multi-task learning. Future research should focus on improving data availability, enhancing model generalization across biomedical subdomains, and exploring the potential of prompt-based fine-tuning and other emerging strategies to further optimize the performance of PLMs in biomedical NLP."

      "content": "Domain-specific pre-trained language models have emerged as a critical advancement in biomedical natural language processing (NLP), offering improved performance on specialized tasks by leveraging domain-specific training data. Among these models, BioBERT and PubMedBERT represent two distinct approaches to domain adaptation, each with unique pre-training strategies, training data, and task objectives. BioBERT is pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora, including PubMed abstracts and PubMed Central (PMC) full-text articles, and is based on the BERT architecture. It utilizes the original BERT vocabulary and WordPiece tokenization to ensure compatibility with existing tools and frameworks [5]. In contrast, PubMedBERT is trained from scratch on biomedical text, employing a custom vocabulary derived from biomedical corpora and utilizing whole word masking during pre-training, which differs from the subword tokenization used in BERT. This distinction in pre-training strategies suggests that PubMedBERT may better capture the semantic nuances of biomedical terminology, while BioBERT benefits from its compatibility with the broader BERT ecosystem.\n\nClinicalBERT, another domain-specific model, is specifically tailored for clinical text, with training data drawn from electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical notes. This focus on clinical data enables ClinicalBERT to excel in tasks such as named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction in clinical contexts, where the language is often informal and specialized [3]. In comparison, BioBERT is trained on a broader range of biomedical texts, including abstracts and clinical notes, which allows it to generalize across a wider array of biomedical NLP tasks. However, the lack of detailed information on BioBERT’s training data and pre-training procedures in some studies limits a comprehensive comparison with other models [7].\n\nThe effectiveness of domain adaptation in improving model performance is evident in the results of studies evaluating these models on biomedical NER tasks. For instance, PubMedBERT demonstrates strong performance on NER tasks in clinical trial eligibility criteria, highlighting the importance of domain-aligned training data in enhancing model generalization and accuracy [1]. Similarly, the systematic survey on pre-trained language models in the biomedical domain reports that BioBERT and ClinicalBERT achieve higher F1-scores and accuracy on specific biomedical corpora compared to general-purpose models, underscoring the benefits of domain-specific pre-training [3].\n\nDespite these advantages, domain-specific models also face challenges. For example, the limited availability of annotated biomedical data can hinder the fine-tuning of these models for specific tasks. Additionally, while BioBERT and ClinicalBERT are designed for biomedical and clinical NLP tasks, their performance may vary depending on the task and data distribution. The comparative study of pre-trained models for NER in clinical trial eligibility criteria further emphasizes that the choice of model should be guided by the specific requirements of the task and the characteristics of the training data [1].\n\nIn summary, domain-specific pre-trained models such as BioBERT, PubMedBERT, and ClinicalBERT represent significant progress in biomedical NLP by adapting to the unique linguistic and semantic properties of biomedical and clinical texts. While they offer improved performance on specialized tasks, their effectiveness is contingent upon the quality and relevance of the training data, as well as the alignment of their pre-training objectives with the target tasks. The insights from these models highlight the importance of domain adaptation in enhancing model performance and suggest that future research should focus on improving data availability and model generalization across biomedical subdomains."

      "content": "Transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies have become central to improving the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in biomedical natural language processing (NLP), particularly in tasks such as biomedical named entity recognition (NER). A comparative analysis of the strategies employed in [1,5,7] reveals several common practices that contribute to better performance in biomedical NER tasks.\n\nOne prominent strategy is the use of task-specific heads, which allow models to adapt their output layers to the specific requirements of downstream tasks. For instance, in [5], both BioBERT and PubMedBERT are fine-tuned with task-specific layers for NER, relation extraction, and question answering (QA). These layers are crucial for aligning the model’s learned representations with the target task, thereby improving performance. Similarly, [1] emphasizes the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning, where the model is adjusted to the unique characteristics of clinical trial eligibility criteria, often through the addition of task-specific layers.\n\nAnother widely adopted approach is the incorporation of external knowledge, which enhances the model's ability to understand domain-specific terminology and relationships. While the specific mechanisms for this vary, some studies, such as [7], integrate syntactic information into the model through a novel attention module, thereby improving the recognition of biomedical entities. This suggests that the integration of external linguistic or domain-specific knowledge can significantly enhance the model's contextual understanding and accuracy.\n\nMulti-task learning (MTL) is another key strategy that has been explored in several studies. [7] introduces a fully-shared MTL approach, where the model is fine-tuned for multiple BioNER tasks simultaneously. This strategy allows the model to leverage shared representations across tasks, potentially improving generalization and reducing the need for task-specific tuning. However, the study does not elaborate on how this approach compares to other fine-tuning methods, such as task-specific layers or data augmentation, which are discussed in other works.\n\nData augmentation techniques have also been shown to be effective in addressing the challenge of data scarcity in biomedical NER. The study in [1] demonstrates that leveraging additional corpora can improve NER performance, especially when domain-specific models are fine-tuned. This highlights the importance of data diversity in enhancing model robustness and adaptability.\n\nDespite these advancements, several areas remain underexplored. For instance, while the integration of external knowledge and multi-task learning has shown promise, there is limited discussion on how these strategies can be systematically combined or optimized. Additionally, the role of prompt engineering in fine-tuning, as explored in [9], remains underutilized in the context of biomedical NER. Future research could benefit from a more holistic approach that combines task-specific adaptation, knowledge integration, and multi-task learning, while also exploring the potential of prompt-based fine-tuning in biomedical settings.\n\nIn summary, the fine-tuning strategies discussed in the literature emphasize the importance of task-specific adaptation, external knowledge incorporation, and multi-task learning. These approaches have contributed to improved performance in biomedical NER tasks, but further research is needed to address limitations such as data scarcity, model generalizability, and the integration of diverse fine-tuning techniques."

These models, such as PubMedBERT and ClinicalBERT, demonstrate superior performance due to their tailored training data and specialized architectures, which better capture the complexities of biomedical terminology and syntactic structures. However, the trade-off between model complexity and performance remains a critical consideration, as more sophisticated models often require greater computational resources and may not always yield proportional gains in accuracy [2].\n\nHybrid and multi-task learning approaches have emerged as promising strategies to enhance BioNER performance by leveraging shared representations across multiple tasks. The integration of attention mechanisms and fully-shared multi-task learning frameworks has shown significant improvements in F1 scores across benchmark datasets [7]. These approaches not only improve generalization across different biomedical domains but also address challenges such as entity ambiguity and data sparsity. However, the complexity of aligning tasks and the risk of negative transfer remain open challenges that require further investigation [7].\n\nIn addition to domain-specific models and hybrid learning, the role of large language models (LLMs) in BioNER has also been explored. While traditional fine-tuned models like BERT and BART generally outperform LLMs in standard NER tasks, closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 exhibit superior performance in reasoning-intensive tasks, highlighting the potential of different model architectures in specific applications [4]. This suggests that while domain adaptation remains a key factor, the architectural and training paradigms of models also play a critical role in their effectiveness.\n\nOverall, the current research in BioNER underscores the importance of domain-specific training, multi-task learning, and model architecture in achieving high performance. However, challenges such as generalizability across domains, computational efficiency, and task alignment continue to pose significant barriers. Future research should focus on developing more robust and scalable frameworks that can effectively address these challenges while maintaining high accuracy and interpretability in biomedical text processing."

For instance, the study by [1] evaluates multiple models, including BioBERT, BlueBERT, PubMedBERT, SciBERT, BERT, and SpanBERT, on clinical trial eligibility criteria corpora. The results indicate that domain-specific models, particularly PubMedBERT, demonstrate superior performance, underscoring the importance of domain adaptation in BioNER. This finding is corroborated by [5], which reports that PubMedBERT outperforms BioBERT on the BLURB benchmark, attributing this to its custom vocabulary and whole word masking strategies. These features enable PubMedBERT to better capture the nuances of biomedical terminology, which is critical for accurate entity recognition in specialized domains.\n\nFurther analysis of comparative studies reveals that the performance gap between domain-specific and general-domain models is often attributed to the quality and relevance of training data. The paper by [2] highlights that domain-specific models, such as BioBERT and ClinicalBERT, achieve higher F1-scores and accuracy on BioNER tasks, particularly when the tasks require deep domain knowledge. This suggests that the quality and domain-specificity of training data significantly influence model effectiveness. Similarly, [3] emphasizes that domain adaptation is a critical factor in improving performance, as models trained on general corpora lack the specialized vocabulary and syntactic structures found in biomedical texts.\n\nWhile domain-specific models generally outperform their general counterparts, some studies suggest that hybrid approaches may offer additional benefits. For example, [3] notes that combining multiple models can lead to improved performance, particularly in complex or ambiguous tasks. However, such approaches often require careful design and integration to avoid redundancy or conflicting predictions. In contrast, the study by [4] evaluates large language models (LLMs) such as GPT and LLaMA in BioNER tasks, finding that traditional fine-tuning of models like BERT and BART outperforms LLMs in most cases. However, closed-source LLMs show better performance in reasoning-intensive tasks, suggesting that while domain adaptation remains crucial, the architecture and training paradigm of models also play a significant role.\n\nOverall, the comparative studies highlight that domain adaptation and data quality are pivotal in BioNER. Models trained on domain-specific corpora, such as PubMedBERT and ClinicalBERT, demonstrate superior performance due to their tailored training data and specialized architectures. However, the integration of multiple models or the use of advanced training techniques may further enhance performance, particularly in complex or under-resourced tasks. These findings collectively emphasize the need for continued research into domain-specific pre-training and the development of robust evaluation frameworks to assess model effectiveness in the biomedical domain."

      "level": 3,
      "content": "The integration of hybrid and multi-task learning approaches has emerged as a promising direction for improving the performance of biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) systems. One notable study, [7], introduces a hybrid framework that combines a novel attention module with a fully-shared multi-task learning strategy. This approach leverages auto-processed syntactic information through the attention mechanism, while the multi-task learning component enables the model to simultaneously learn from multiple BioNER tasks. The results demonstrate significant performance gains across seven benchmark datasets, underscoring the potential of joint learning in biomedical NER tasks. However, the paper lacks a detailed description of the model architecture and training procedures beyond the attention mechanism and the multi-task framework, which limits the reproducibility and deeper analysis of the method.\n\nIn contrast, traditional single-task models typically focus on optimizing performance for a single NER task, often at the expense of generalization across different biomedical domains. While such models may achieve high accuracy on specific tasks, they often struggle with out-of-domain or low-resource scenarios. The multi-task learning framework described in [7] addresses this limitation by enabling the model to benefit from shared representations across multiple tasks, thereby improving its ability to generalize and adapt to diverse biomedical texts.\n\nThe benefits of joint learning in BioNER are further supported by other works, such as [2] and [3], which describe architectures that integrate multiple tasks—such as entity recognition and relation extraction—into a unified framework. These studies emphasize the role of shared layers and joint optimization of multiple objectives in enhancing model generalization. By learning from multiple tasks simultaneously, models can capture more nuanced linguistic patterns and domain-specific knowledge, leading to improved performance in complex biomedical text.\n\nDespite these advantages, integrating multiple tasks in BioNER presents several challenges. One major issue is the complexity of aligning different tasks, especially when they involve varying levels of granularity or different types of annotations. Additionally, the risk of negative transfer—where learning one task hinders performance on another—remains a concern. The study in [7] does not explicitly address these challenges, suggesting a need for further investigation into task compatibility and the design of more robust multi-task frameworks.\n\nFuture research directions could focus on refining the architecture of hybrid models to better handle task interactions and reduce the risk of negative transfer. Incorporating more sophisticated attention mechanisms, such as hierarchical or cross-task attention, may help the model better distinguish between task-specific and shared features. Additionally, exploring the use of task-specific adapters or dynamic weighting schemes could provide more flexibility in multi-task learning. Another promising avenue is the integration of external knowledge sources, such as biomedical ontologies, to guide the learning process and improve the interpretability of the model.\n\nIn conclusion, hybrid and multi-task learning approaches offer a powerful means of enhancing BioNER performance by leveraging shared representations and joint optimization. While the current literature provides evidence of their effectiveness, further research is needed to address the challenges associated with task integration and to develop more scalable and robust frameworks for biomedical NER."

      "content": "The application of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in the biomedical domain is hindered by a range of challenges that span data availability, domain adaptation, model interpretability, and computational efficiency. A consistent theme across multiple studies is the persistent issue of data scarcity, particularly in the form of high-quality annotated datasets. This limitation is especially pronounced in specialized areas such as clinical trial eligibility criteria, electronic health records (EHRs), and biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER), where the complexity and sensitivity of the data make annotation both costly and difficult . While strategies such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning have been proposed to mitigate this issue, their effectiveness remains context-dependent and often insufficient for achieving robust performance .\n\nDomain adaptation and generalization represent another major challenge, as models trained on one biomedical domain often struggle to perform well on others. Fine-tuning on domain-specific data has shown promise in improving task-specific performance, but it can reduce the model’s flexibility and generalization capability . Domain-specific pre-training, while beneficial, also faces limitations in cross-domain adaptability, highlighting the need for more transferable and scalable adaptation techniques . Additionally, the integration of external knowledge sources, such as medical ontologies, has been proposed as a complementary approach, but its impact on generalization remains limited .\n\nModel interpretability and computational efficiency are further critical concerns. Many studies emphasize the lack of transparency in PLM decision-making, which is particularly problematic in clinical and research settings where explainability is essential . Moreover, the computational costs associated with training and deploying large models, especially large language models (LLMs), pose significant barriers to practical implementation . These models also face challenges such as hallucinations, missing information, and the need for extensive prompt engineering, which can affect their reliability and consistency in biomedical tasks .\n\nDespite these challenges, several studies have explored innovative solutions, such as retrieval-enhanced learning and contrastive learning, to improve model robustness and generalization . However, these approaches are still in early stages and require further investigation to address the limitations of data sparsity, domain adaptability, and model interpretability. Future research should focus on developing more efficient, interpretable, and scalable PLM architectures that can effectively bridge the gap between general-domain models and specialized biomedical applications.

      "content": "Data scarcity and annotation challenges represent significant barriers to the development and application of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in the biomedical domain. Multiple studies highlight the lack of high-quality annotated datasets as a critical limitation, which restricts model training, evaluation, and generalization. For instance, the paper on biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) emphasizes that the scarcity of annotated data hinders the performance of existing systems and motivates the development of more effective models [7]. Similarly, a comparative study on pre-trained language models for clinical trial eligibility criteria notes that the unstructured and complex nature of the text further complicates the creation of annotated datasets [1].\n\nThe challenges are not limited to clinical texts; the same issue is observed in electronic health records (EHRs), where the sensitive nature of the data and the complexity of clinical language make annotation both difficult and expensive [8]. Moreover, the high cost of manual annotation and the need for domain experts exacerbate the problem, as noted in a systematic survey on pre-trained language models in the biomedical domain [2].\n\nTo address these challenges, various studies have explored strategies such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning. For example, the paper on biomedical named entity recognition discusses the use of transfer learning as a means to mitigate data scarcity, though it does not provide specific techniques or detailed implementations [7]. In contrast, the systematic survey on pre-trained language models in the biomedical domain explicitly mentions the application of data augmentation, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning as viable solutions, while acknowledging that these methods are not always sufficient and require further exploration [2].\n\nThe effectiveness of these approaches varies depending on the specific task and dataset. While data augmentation can increase the size of the training set, it may introduce noise or reduce the representativeness of the data. Transfer learning, on the other hand, leverages pre-trained models on large-scale general-domain corpora, which can improve performance on smaller biomedical datasets, but may also lead to domain-specific performance degradation if not properly fine-tuned. Semi-supervised learning offers a promising alternative by utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data, but its success depends on the quality and distribution of the unlabeled data.\n\nDespite these efforts, the trade-off between data quality and model performance remains a central issue. High-quality annotated data is essential for training robust models, but the cost and effort required to produce such data often limit its availability. As a result, researchers have increasingly turned to synthetic data generation as a potential solution. While this approach can alleviate data scarcity, it raises concerns about the realism and generalizability of the generated data. The paper on biomedical entity linking, for instance, explores retrieval-enhanced learning as a method to improve entity linking performance, but it does not directly address synthetic data generation as a strategy for overcoming data limitations [6].\n\nIn summary, while multiple studies have proposed strategies to mitigate data scarcity and annotation challenges in the biomedical domain, the effectiveness of these approaches is context-dependent. Future research should focus on developing more scalable and cost-effective annotation methods, as well as improving the quality and diversity of synthetic data to better support the training of robust biomedical language models."

      "content": "Domain adaptation and generalization remain critical challenges in the application of pre-trained language models (PLMs) within the biomedical domain. The studies reviewed here highlight various strategies for adapting models to specialized biomedical tasks, with a particular focus on fine-tuning, domain-specific pre-training, and knowledge integration. These approaches aim to enhance model performance on new or unseen biomedical data, yet they often face limitations in generalizing across different domains or tasks.\n\nFine-tuning on domain-specific data is a widely adopted technique, as it allows models to adapt to the linguistic and semantic characteristics of biomedical texts. For instance, the study by [1] demonstrates that domain-specific models such as PubMedBERT outperform general-domain models in recognizing named entities in clinical trial eligibility criteria. Similarly, [2] emphasizes that fine-tuning improves task-specific performance but may reduce the model’s ability to generalize to new domains. This trade-off between task-specific optimization and domain flexibility is a recurring theme in the literature.\n\nDomain-specific pre-training is another strategy that has shown promise in improving model adaptability. [2,8] both discuss the benefits of pre-training on biomedical corpora, such as PubMed or EHR data, which can enhance the model’s understanding of domain-specific terminology and structures. However, the same study also notes that models trained on one domain often struggle to perform well in others, indicating that domain-specific pre-training alone may not be sufficient for broad generalization.\n\nIn addition to fine-tuning and pre-training, knowledge integration has emerged as an important component of domain adaptation. [8] suggests that incorporating external knowledge sources, such as medical ontologies or clinical guidelines, can improve model performance on specialized tasks. However, the study also highlights that generalization across different medical specialties or tasks remains a significant challenge, underscoring the need for more robust and flexible adaptation techniques.\n\nWhile these approaches have contributed to improved performance on specific biomedical tasks, the generalization capabilities of models across diverse domains and tasks remain limited. [2] points out that models trained on one domain often fail to generalize to others, which restricts their applicability in real-world settings. Similarly, [4] finds that traditional fine-tuning of BERT or BART models outperforms large language models (LLMs) in most biomedical tasks, but LLMs require domain-specific fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. This suggests that while LLMs have strong reasoning capabilities, they are not inherently well-suited for biomedical tasks without significant adaptation.\n\nSome studies have explored more advanced methods for improving generalization, such as retrieval-enhanced learning and contrastive learning. [6] introduces a framework that leverages k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and dynamic hard negative sampling (DHNS) to enhance the model's ability to generalize to diverse biomedical entities. This approach demonstrates that incorporating retrieval mechanisms can improve model robustness, particularly in tasks involving entity linking and recognition.\n\nDespite these advances, several challenges persist in the domain adaptation and generalization of PLMs in the biomedical field. First, the lack of comprehensive evaluation across multiple domains and tasks limits the ability to draw generalizable conclusions. For example, [7] focuses on improving BioNER performance within the biomedical domain but does not provide an analysis of generalization to other domains. Second, the effectiveness of domain adaptation techniques often depends on the availability of high-quality, annotated domain-specific data, which can be scarce or expensive to obtain.\n\nFuture research should focus on developing more scalable and transferable domain adaptation methods that can handle the diversity of biomedical data. This includes exploring techniques that combine fine-tuning with knowledge integration, as well as leveraging self-supervised learning to reduce reliance on labeled data. Additionally, there is a need for standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols that can assess model generalization across different biomedical tasks and domains. By addressing these challenges, the field can move closer to building PLMs that are both task-specific and broadly applicable in the biomedical domain."

      "content": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) into biomedical natural language processing (NLP) represents a transformative shift from traditional, task-specific approaches such as named entity recognition (NER) to more complex, context-aware, and integrated applications, particularly in the analysis of electronic health records (EHRs) [4,8]. This trend is supported by multiple studies, which highlight the potential of LLMs to perform tasks such as text summarization, information extraction, diagnosis prediction, and clinical decision support, demonstrating a broader scope of applicability compared to conventional pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BioBERT or PubMedBERT [4,8].\n\nA key emerging direction is the integration of LLMs with biomedical knowledge graphs and ontologies, such as UMLS and SNOMED-CT, to enhance their interpretability, semantic understanding, and ability to perform reasoning tasks. This approach is seen as a critical step in bridging the gap between unstructured clinical text and structured biomedical knowledge, thereby improving the reliability and utility of LLMs in clinical settings [2,3,4]. However, challenges remain, including the difficulty of aligning model outputs with structured knowledge, the need for domain-specific mappings, and the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for knowledge-enhanced models [2,3].\n\nDespite their advantages, LLMs also face significant limitations in biomedical applications. These include issues such as hallucinations, high computational costs, and the need for extensive domain-specific fine-tuning, which can be prohibitive in resource-constrained environments [4,9]. Additionally, ethical concerns such as data privacy, model bias, and the interpretability of model outputs must be addressed to ensure responsible deployment in clinical settings [9].\n\nOpportunities for future research include the development of more scalable and interpretable LLMs, the exploration of model compression techniques to reduce computational demands, and the integration of LLMs with traditional PLMs to leverage the strengths of both approaches [4,9]. Furthermore, the use of self-supervised learning and data augmentation techniques can help mitigate the challenges of limited annotated datasets, as suggested by several studies [1,2].\n\nIn summary, while the application of LLMs in biomedical NLP is still in its early stages, the field is rapidly evolving, with a growing emphasis on integrating domain-specific knowledge, improving model interpretability, and addressing ethical and practical challenges. Future research should focus on developing robust, efficient, and ethically aligned models that can effectively support biomedical research and clinical practice [4,8,9]."

      "content": "The integration of pre-trained language models (PLMs) with biomedical knowledge graphs and external resources has emerged as a critical area of research, aiming to enhance the semantic understanding, entity disambiguation, and interpretability of models in the biomedical domain. Several studies have explored this integration, with varying degrees of methodological depth and practical implementation. For instance, the systematic survey by [2,3] outlines the use of structured knowledge sources such as SNOMED-CT, UMLS, and biomedical databases to augment the contextual understanding of PLMs. These studies emphasize that incorporating such knowledge can significantly improve the accuracy of entity recognition and the model’s ability to capture semantic relationships, particularly in tasks involving complex biomedical terminology.\n\nHowever, the integration of PLMs with knowledge graphs presents several challenges. Both [2,3] highlight the difficulty in aligning model outputs with structured knowledge sources, which often require intricate alignment mechanisms and domain-specific mappings. This complexity can hinder the scalability and generalizability of knowledge-enhanced models, particularly when dealing with dynamic or evolving knowledge bases.\n\nIn contrast, some studies, such as [4], only briefly mention the potential of integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs but do not provide detailed methodologies or empirical evaluations. Similarly, [1,5,7] focus exclusively on model architecture, pre-training strategies, and task-specific performance without addressing the integration of external knowledge. These works suggest that while the theoretical benefits of knowledge integration are recognized, practical implementation remains underexplored in many studies.\n\nThe effectiveness of different integration strategies varies depending on the task and the nature of the knowledge source. For example, models that incorporate ontological structures like UMLS may benefit from improved entity linking and semantic role labeling, whereas those leveraging external databases may see enhanced information retrieval and cross-referencing capabilities. However, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics and the absence of comprehensive case studies limit the ability to directly compare these approaches.\n\nOverall, knowledge-enhanced PLMs show significant potential in improving biomedical NLP tasks by bridging the gap between unstructured text and structured knowledge. However, further research is needed to address the challenges of alignment, scalability, and interpretability. Future work should focus on developing more robust and flexible integration frameworks that can seamlessly incorporate multiple knowledge sources while maintaining model efficiency and adaptability."

      "level": 3,
      "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been recognized for their potential in biomedical natural language processing (NLP), particularly in handling complex tasks such as electronic health record (EHR) analysis, medical question answering, and clinical decision support. Studies such as [4,8] highlight that LLMs demonstrate superior contextual understanding and text generation capabilities compared to traditional pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BioBERT or PubMedBERT. These models excel in tasks that require nuanced comprehension of clinical narratives, but their performance on specialized tasks such as diagnosis and prediction remains an area requiring further refinement [8].\n\nWhile LLMs show promise, they also exhibit several limitations that hinder their direct application in clinical settings. One of the primary concerns is the issue of hallucinations, where the models generate information that is not supported by the input data, which can be particularly problematic in medical contexts where accuracy is critical [4]. Additionally, the high computational costs associated with training and deploying LLMs pose significant challenges, especially in resource-constrained environments. The need for extensive domain-specific fine-tuning further complicates their integration into biomedical workflows, as it requires large annotated datasets and significant computational resources [2].\n\nComparative analyses indicate that traditional PLMs, such as BioBERT, are more efficient in terms of computational requirements and are often better suited for specific tasks like named entity recognition (NER) in clinical trial documents. However, these models lack the contextual understanding and generative capabilities that LLMs offer. For instance, while [1] focuses on the performance of BERT-based models in NER tasks, it suggests that larger models could potentially enhance performance in this domain, although this potential has not yet been fully explored [1].\n\nTo address these challenges, several strategies have been proposed. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, can reduce the size and computational demands of LLMs without significantly compromising performance. Domain-specific fine-tuning is also crucial for adapting LLMs to the unique linguistic and semantic structures of biomedical texts, as emphasized in [4,9]. Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with external knowledge sources, such as biomedical ontologies and knowledge graphs, has been suggested as a way to enhance their reasoning and classification capabilities in clinical settings [9].\n\nEthical considerations also play a critical role in the deployment of LLMs in clinical environments. Issues such as data privacy, model bias, and the interpretability of model outputs must be carefully addressed to ensure that LLMs are used responsibly and transparently. Future research should focus on developing more robust, efficient, and ethically aligned LLMs that can effectively support biomedical research and clinical practice."

      "content": "The synthesis of future research directions from multiple studies highlights several recurring themes, including the need for improved model generalization, reduced dependency on large annotated datasets, and enhanced interpretability for clinical deployment. These themes are consistently emphasized across various papers, such as [2,3,4], which collectively stress the importance of developing models that can perform robustly across diverse biomedical tasks without excessive data requirements. For instance, the systematic survey in [2] calls for more standardized benchmarks and collaborative efforts to address the fragmented nature of current research.\n\nA particularly notable direction is the improvement of model interpretability, especially for clinical applications. This is highlighted in multiple studies, including [8,9], which argue that interpretability is essential for gaining trust and facilitating the integration of language models into clinical workflows. The paper in [9] further suggests that reducing reliance on prompt engineering is a critical step toward achieving more user-friendly and reliable models.\n\nIn addition to these general directions, some studies propose more specific research avenues. For example, [6] emphasizes the need for better handling of rare entities in biomedical entity linking tasks, suggesting that retrieval-based methods and contrastive learning could significantly improve model performance in this area. This aligns with the broader goal of enhancing model adaptability and generalization, as noted in several other papers.\n\nInterdisciplinary integration is another key theme, with multiple studies advocating for the fusion of pre-trained language models (PLMs) with clinical workflows and biomedical knowledge systems. The paper in [3,4] both suggest that such integrations could lead to more practical applications in drug discovery, personalized medicine, and clinical decision support. This aligns with the broader vision of leveraging PLMs not just as standalone models but as components of larger, more sophisticated systems.\n\nA potential roadmap for future research could involve three main areas: (1) improving data efficiency and generalization through advanced training techniques and data augmentation strategies, (2) enhancing model interpretability and clinical usability via better visualization tools and explainability frameworks, and (3) exploring the integration of PLMs with other AI techniques, such as graph-based models or reinforcement learning, to address limitations in current approaches. For instance, combining PLMs with graph-based models could allow for more effective knowledge integration, while reinforcement learning could be used to optimize model performance in dynamic clinical environments.\n\nOverall, the research community is moving toward a more holistic and application-driven approach to pre-trained language models in the biomedical domain, with a strong emphasis on practical deployment, interpretability, and interdisciplinary collaboration. The findings from these studies collectively point to a future where PLMs are not only more powerful but also more accessible, reliable, and integrated into the broader biomedical ecosystem."

      "content": "The reviewed studies have significantly advanced the application of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in the biomedical domain, offering both practical insights and theoretical contributions that shape the current landscape of biomedical natural language processing (NLP). A key finding across multiple studies is the superiority of domain-specific PLMs, such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT, in tasks like biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) and clinical trial eligibility criteria analysis [1,5]. These models benefit from domain-specific pre-training, which enhances their performance compared to general-domain models. For instance, PubMedBERT's custom vocabulary and whole-word masking contribute to its improved performance in certain biomedical tasks, underscoring the importance of tailored training strategies [5].\n\nIn contrast, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 demonstrate strong potential in reasoning-intensive tasks, particularly in medical question answering, but generally lag behind domain-specific models in most biomedical NLP tasks. This suggests that while LLMs have promising capabilities, they require further domain adaptation, prompt engineering, and integration with traditional PLMs to achieve comparable performance in specialized biomedical contexts [4,9]. The benchmarking study further highlights that domain-specific fine-tuning of open-source LLMs can mitigate some of the limitations, such as data scarcity and computational costs, but challenges like model interpretability and hallucination remain critical barriers to broader adoption [4].\n\nThe systematic survey [2] provides a comprehensive overview of the achievements and challenges in the field, emphasizing the need for better data curation, knowledge graph integration, and model generalization. It also points to the growing interest in combining traditional PLMs with emerging techniques, such as retrieval-enhanced learning, which has shown promise in biomedical entity linking tasks. The kNN-BioEL framework, for example, demonstrates that integrating retrieval mechanisms with contrastive learning can significantly improve performance in entity linking, suggesting that hybrid approaches may offer a path forward for overcoming the limitations of purely model-based solutions [6].\n\nMoreover, the study on multi-task learning with syntactic attention modules [7] highlights the value of incorporating syntactic features and leveraging shared learning across tasks to enhance model effectiveness. While this approach shows measurable improvements in BioNER, the lack of a broader discussion on its implications for the field indicates a need for more holistic evaluations of such techniques.\n\nLooking ahead, the role of PLMs in advancing biomedical NLP is poised to expand, particularly as researchers continue to refine domain adaptation strategies, improve data efficiency, and develop more interpretable models. The potential of LLMs in tasks requiring complex reasoning, such as clinical decision support and medical knowledge extraction, remains a promising area for future exploration. However, the challenges of data scarcity, model generalization, and ethical concerns in clinical applications must be addressed to ensure the safe and effective deployment of these models in real-world settings [8].\n\nIn summary, the reviewed studies collectively underscore the transformative potential of PLMs in biomedical NLP while highlighting the critical areas that require further research and development. The field is at a pivotal stage, where the integration of domain-specific knowledge, advanced learning techniques, and ethical considerations will determine the next phase of innovation and application."
