# 0. Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in International Business Research

## 1. Section 1: Introduction and Background of QCA in International Business Research
Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) has evolved from a niche method rooted in political science and sociology to a more widely recognized analytical tool in international business (IB) research. Early discussions of QCA in the context of IB research emphasized its conceptual origins and its potential to address complex, multi-causal phenomena that traditional linear methods often fail to capture [1,4]. These early applications positioned QCA as a method that complements both qualitative and quantitative approaches by focusing on the interplay of conditions rather than isolated variables, particularly in cross-country and cross-cultural studies [3].

Over time, the adoption of QCA in IB research has grown, with an increasing number of studies recognizing its value in exploring multiple pathways to outcomes, especially in contexts where configurational thinking is essential. The method’s ability to handle small to medium-sized datasets and its focus on categorical or ordinal data have made it particularly appealing for analyzing phenomena that are not easily reducible to linear causal relationships [4]. This shift reflects a broader trend in IB research toward more nuanced, context-sensitive methodologies that can better reflect the complexity of international business environments.

The rationale for using QCA varies across subfields within IB. In strategy research, for instance, QCA is valued for its capacity to identify configurations of firm-specific and environmental conditions that lead to competitive advantage, offering insights that go beyond traditional regression analyses [3]. In organization studies, QCA is often employed to explore how different combinations of institutional, cultural, and organizational factors shape firm behavior and performance across diverse contexts [2]. In contrast, in international market entry research, QCA is used to uncover the diverse pathways through which firms navigate the complexities of foreign markets, emphasizing the importance of context-specific configurations over generalized models [3].

Despite its growing prominence, QCA remains a method that is still in the process of being fully integrated into the mainstream of IB research. While some studies highlight its potential to enhance the depth and relevance of IB research, others note that its adoption is still limited, particularly when compared to more traditional quantitative methods [1]. Nonetheless, the increasing number of applications and the methodological advancements in QCA suggest that it is becoming an essential tool for researchers seeking to understand the multifaceted nature of international business phenomena.
## 2. Section 2: Methodological Foundations and Applications of QCA in International Business Research
The methodological foundations and applications of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in international business (IB) research are rooted in configurational and set-theoretic principles, which offer a distinct approach to understanding complex, context-dependent phenomena. QCA shifts the analytical focus from variable-oriented methods to configuration-based analysis, emphasizing how combinations of conditions lead to specific outcomes. This approach is particularly valuable in IB research, where phenomena such as firm performance, market entry strategies, and cross-cultural management are shaped by multiple, interrelated factors. The theoretical underpinnings of QCA are grounded in configurational thinking, which posits that outcomes result from the interaction of multiple conditions rather than from single causal factors. This is operationalized through methodological steps such as calibration, consistency checks, and coverage analysis, with fuzzy-set QCA (fsQCA) being widely used for its flexibility in handling context-sensitive data [3,4].

Empirically, QCA has been applied to a range of IB research questions, including the analysis of foreign direct investment (FDI) success, corporate policy support for climate change, and the strategic configurations of multinational enterprises (MNEs). These applications demonstrate the method's ability to uncover non-linear and context-specific causal relationships that traditional statistical methods may miss. For example, studies have shown that no single configuration of institutional quality, firm resources, and strategic orientation consistently leads to successful FDI outcomes, highlighting the importance of context-specific configurations [3]. Similarly, the analysis of transnational companies’ climate policy support reveals that configurations involving corporate size, sector, and public commitments are associated with higher levels of policy engagement [6].

While QCA offers significant methodological advantages, such as the ability to identify multiple pathways to an outcome and to handle non-linear relationships, it also presents challenges. These include difficulties in establishing causal inference, the risk of overfitting in small datasets, and the need for careful selection of conditions and outcomes. Comparative analyses with other methods, such as regression analysis and case study research, reveal that QCA occupies a unique position by combining the depth of qualitative analysis with the generalizability of quantitative methods. However, it is often most effective when integrated with complementary approaches to enhance the robustness of findings [2,3].

Despite its growing recognition, the empirical applications of QCA in IB research remain limited in number and depth. Many studies provide only a brief introduction to QCA’s theoretical foundations without elaborating on its technical aspects, and there is a need for more in-depth case studies and systematic exploration of how variable selection and data sources influence the identification of causal configurations. Future research should aim to address these gaps by expanding the methodological rigor of QCA applications and exploring its potential in diverse IB contexts, including sustainability, corporate governance, and strategic decision-making.
### 2.1 Subsection 2.1: Theoretical and Methodological Frameworks of QCA
The theoretical and methodological frameworks of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) are grounded in configurational theory and set theory, which provide a foundation for understanding how combinations of conditions lead to specific outcomes. This approach diverges from traditional variable-oriented methods by focusing on configurations rather than average effects, making it particularly suitable for analyzing complex, context-dependent phenomena in international business research [3,4].

Configurational thinking underpins QCA, emphasizing that outcomes are the result of multiple, interrelated conditions rather than single causal factors. This is reflected in the methodological steps outlined by several studies, including calibration, consistency checks, and coverage analysis. For instance, the calibration process involves translating qualitative data into fuzzy sets, allowing for a more nuanced representation of cases and conditions. This is particularly highlighted in the use of fuzzy-set QCA (fsQCA), which is favored for its flexibility in handling complex and context-sensitive data [3,4].

However, not all studies provide an equally detailed methodological exposition. While some papers, such as those by [4] and [3], offer comprehensive descriptions of QCA's methodological steps, others, like [1], only briefly introduce the theoretical foundations without elaborating on the technical aspects of the method. This divergence in methodological depth suggests varying levels of engagement with QCA's technical nuances across the literature.

In terms of methodological emphasis, some studies prioritize the configurational approach, focusing on identifying combinations of conditions that lead to specific outcomes. For example, [2] emphasizes that QCA operates on conditions rather than variables, with conditions being sets in which cases can be members or non-members to different degrees. This aligns with the broader configurational perspective, which captures both qualitative and quantitative differences. In contrast, other studies, such as [6], focus more on the application of QCA to specific research questions, such as identifying the conditions under which transnational companies support climate policies, without delving deeply into the theoretical or methodological underpinnings.

Despite these differences, there is a common emphasis on the importance of selecting appropriate conditions and outcomes for analysis. The configurational approach is particularly well-suited to answering "what combinations of conditions lead to success" type questions, which is relevant to various international business phenomena, including firm performance, market entry strategies, and cross-cultural management [3,4].

In summary, while the theoretical and methodological frameworks of QCA are broadly consistent in their reliance on configurational and set-theoretic principles, there are notable divergences in how the method is framed and applied. Some studies emphasize the configurational approach, while others focus more on technical aspects such as fuzzy-set versus crisp-set methods. These variations reflect the flexibility of QCA as a methodological tool, as well as the differing priorities of researchers in applying it to international business contexts.
### 2.2 Subsection 2.2: Case Studies and Empirical Applications of QCA
The empirical applications of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in international business (IB) research have been increasingly recognized for their ability to uncover complex causal configurations that traditional statistical methods may overlook. Several studies have demonstrated the utility of QCA in analyzing multinational enterprises (MNEs) and their strategies, particularly in contexts where multiple conditions interact in non-linear ways. For instance, the study referenced in [3] applies QCA to examine how combinations of institutional and firm-level factors influence the success of foreign direct investment (FDI). The variables included institutional quality, firm resources, and strategic orientation, revealing that no single configuration of these conditions consistently leads to successful FDI outcomes. This finding underscores the importance of context-specific configurations, a key advantage of QCA in capturing nuanced relationships in IB research.

In contrast, the study in [6] applies QCA to a dataset of 100 transnational companies, focusing on their policy support for climate change mitigation. The analysis identifies configurations of conditions such as corporate size, sector, and public commitments that are associated with higher levels of policy support. This application of QCA highlights its adaptability to different research contexts, including sustainability and corporate governance. The use of secondary data from sources like InfluenceMap further demonstrates the flexibility of QCA in leveraging existing datasets to explore complex phenomena in international business settings.

Comparing these applications, it is evident that the choice of variables and data sources significantly influences the interpretation of QCA results. While the study on FDI success emphasizes institutional and strategic factors, the climate policy study focuses on organizational and sectoral characteristics. These differences reflect the diversity of research questions in IB and the need to tailor QCA configurations to the specific context under investigation. Moreover, the reliance on secondary data in the climate policy study illustrates how QCA can be applied even when primary data collection is limited, although this may introduce constraints in terms of data granularity and contextual depth.

Despite these advances, the literature also points to a notable gap in the empirical applications of QCA within IB research. As noted in [1] and [4], the number of detailed case studies and empirical applications remains limited. This scarcity of in-depth studies suggests that while QCA is gaining traction, its methodological potential in IB research has yet to be fully realized. Future studies could benefit from more systematic exploration of how different variable selections and data sources shape the identification of causal configurations, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalizability of QCA findings in international business contexts.
### 2.3 Subsection 2.3: Comparative Analysis of QCA with Other Methods
Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) has been increasingly recognized as a valuable methodological tool in international business (IB) research, particularly due to its capacity to handle complex, non-linear relationships among multiple causal factors. Comparative analyses presented in the literature highlight both the unique strengths and limitations of QCA relative to traditional quantitative and qualitative methods such as regression analysis, case study research, and experimental designs.

One of the key advantages of QCA is its ability to capture non-linear and configurational relationships, which are prevalent in IB contexts where multiple factors interact in complex ways. For instance, QCA is set-theoretic in nature, focusing on configurations of conditions rather than average effects, as is typical in regression analysis [2]. This makes QCA particularly suitable for identifying multiple pathways to an outcome, a feature that is often overlooked in linear regression models, which rely on assumptions of linearity and additivity. As noted in the literature, regression analysis is limited in its ability to handle such complexity without the use of interaction terms, which can complicate model interpretation and reduce generalizability [3].

In contrast to case study research, which provides in-depth insights into individual instances but often lacks generalizability, QCA offers a middle ground by combining the depth of qualitative analysis with the broader applicability of quantitative methods. This hybrid approach allows researchers to maintain the richness of qualitative data while still achieving a level of generalizability that is typically associated with statistical techniques. However, it is important to note that QCA may not be as effective as in-depth case studies in capturing detailed causal mechanisms, particularly in contexts where the research question requires a deep understanding of specific processes or dynamics [3].

Despite these strengths, QCA is not without its limitations. One major concern is the difficulty in establishing causal inference, as QCA primarily identifies sufficient or necessary conditions rather than establishing direct cause-and-effect relationships. This limitation is acknowledged in several studies, which suggest that QCA should be used in conjunction with other methods to triangulate findings and enhance the robustness of conclusions [4]. Additionally, there is a risk of overfitting, particularly when dealing with small or medium-sized datasets, which can lead to the identification of spurious configurations that do not hold across different contexts.

Overall, the comparative analysis of QCA with other methods underscores its unique value in international business research, where the complexity of phenomena often defies simple linear explanations. By offering a configurational perspective, QCA provides researchers with a powerful tool to explore multiple causal pathways and understand the nuanced interplay of factors that shape international business outcomes. However, its methodological constraints suggest that it is most effective when integrated with complementary approaches, ensuring a more comprehensive and reliable understanding of the research phenomenon.
## 3. Section 3: Contributions and Impacts of QCA in International Business Research
Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) has emerged as a transformative methodological tool in international business research, offering both theoretical and practical contributions that challenge conventional approaches. Theoretically, QCA has advanced the understanding of complex, context-dependent phenomena by moving beyond linear and reductionist models. It enables the identification of multiple causal pathways, thereby enriching theories of internationalization, institutional adaptation, and strategic flexibility [2,3]. By emphasizing the interplay of multiple conditions, QCA supports the development of configurational theories that account for the dynamic and contingent nature of international business environments. This methodological shift has facilitated the refinement of established theories, such as the Uppsala model and institutional theory, while also opening new avenues for theoretical exploration [3].

In practical terms, QCA provides actionable insights that inform context-sensitive decision-making for managers and policymakers. Its configurational approach allows for the identification of specific combinations of conditions that lead to successful outcomes, thereby supporting more nuanced and adaptive strategies in areas such as market entry, cross-cultural management, and policy engagement [3,6]. However, despite its potential, the translation of QCA findings into concrete managerial or policy interventions remains underdeveloped. While some studies highlight the method's capacity to reveal best practices and policy frameworks, others point to a lack of detailed strategies derived from configurational analyses [1,4]. This gap underscores the need for further empirical work that bridges the theoretical insights of QCA with practical applications.

Overall, the contributions of QCA to international business research are significant, as it not only enhances theoretical frameworks but also provides a methodological lens for understanding the complexity of global business operations. However, to fully realize its impact, future research must address the limitations in translating configurational insights into actionable strategies, while also exploring the method's potential in emerging areas such as digital transformation, sustainability, and global governance.
### 3.1 Subsection 3.1: Theoretical Contributions
Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) has made significant theoretical contributions to international business research by challenging linear and reductionist assumptions, particularly in the study of institutional environments and firm strategies. Several studies highlight how QCA enables the identification of multiple pathways to success, thereby enriching theories of internationalization, institutional adaptation, and strategic flexibility [2,3]. This configurational approach emphasizes the role of context in shaping strategic choices, offering a more nuanced understanding of how different combinations of institutional and firm-level factors interact to influence international business outcomes [3].

While some studies note that QCA has been instrumental in refining theories of institutional complementarities, others suggest that it has supported the development of configurational theories that move beyond single-factor explanations to consider the interplay of multiple conditions [2,3]. For instance, QCA has been used to challenge the assumption that policy engagement by transnational companies is solely driven by corporate size or sector, instead highlighting the importance of multiple, interacting conditions [6].

However, the extent to which QCA has introduced new configurational theories versus validated existing ones varies across studies. Some papers indicate that QCA has contributed to the refinement or extension of established theories such as the Uppsala model, resource-based view, and institutional theory, though specific examples are not elaborated in the provided texts [4]. Others emphasize its potential to advance theoretical understanding by identifying complex, multi-dimensional phenomena that are not easily captured through traditional linear models [1].

Overall, QCA has influenced the development of theories in areas such as international strategy and cross-border collaboration by providing a methodological framework that accommodates complexity, context, and multiple causal pathways. This has not only enriched existing theoretical frameworks but also opened new avenues for exploring how firms navigate diverse institutional environments in a globalized context.
### 3.2 Subsection 3.2: Practical Implications
The practical implications of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in international business research are increasingly recognized for their capacity to inform context-sensitive decision-making. Several studies highlight how QCA's configurational approach provides actionable insights for managers and policymakers. For instance, the paper by [4] emphasizes that QCA can guide strategies for market entry, resource allocation, and cross-cultural management, though it does not specify the exact nature of these strategies. Similarly, [3] underscores the value of QCA in promoting context-specific strategies, particularly in adapting to different institutional environments. This aligns with the findings of [2], which suggests that QCA can reveal configurations of conditions leading to successful outcomes, thereby supporting more nuanced and context-sensitive strategies for international market entry and stakeholder engagement.

In the realm of cross-cultural management, [3] highlights how QCA has been used to identify best practices and develop policy frameworks that support international business operations. This is especially relevant in global contexts where generic strategies may fail due to varying cultural and institutional landscapes. Furthermore, [6] demonstrates how QCA can inform targeted advocacy strategies for policymakers and civil society organizations, showing that companies with high public visibility and strong sustainability commitments are more likely to support climate policies. This suggests that QCA can help identify key actors and conditions that facilitate effective policy engagement, reinforcing its utility in complex international environments.

Despite these contributions, several studies, including [4] and [1], note a lack of detailed actionable strategies or policy interventions derived from QCA research. This gap indicates a need for further empirical work to translate configurational insights into concrete managerial and policy recommendations. Overall, while QCA offers significant potential for informing practical decision-making, its application in real-world settings requires more explicit guidance on how to operationalize its findings.

Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) has gained increasing attention in international business research for its capacity to identify configurational patterns and complex causal relationships. However, despite its methodological strengths, the application of QCA in this field is not without significant challenges and limitations. This section provides a critical evaluation of these issues, focusing on both methodological and interpretative constraints that affect the reliability, validity, and generalizability of QCA findings. A key concern is the methodological challenge of data scarcity, particularly in international contexts where access to comprehensive and comparable datasets is often limited. This limitation is frequently cited in the literature, as QCA requires a sufficient number of cases to ensure robust and generalizable results, which can be difficult to achieve in the context of international business research [3,6].

Another critical methodological limitation is the subjectivity inherent in the calibration process, which involves translating qualitative conditions into crisp or fuzzy sets. This process is often influenced by the researcher’s judgment, leading to potential inconsistencies in the interpretation of results and affecting the reliability and validity of QCA findings [1,3]. Additionally, the interpretation of consistency and coverage scores remains a complex task, as these metrics do not always provide a clear indication of the strength or relevance of identified configurations.

Beyond methodological concerns, QCA faces interpretative and conceptual challenges, particularly in its ability to capture dynamic and temporal processes. The method is often criticized for its limited capacity to account for the evolving nature of international business phenomena, such as the changing strategies of transnational corporations or the development of corporate policy over time [2,6]. This limitation is further compounded by the sensitivity of QCA results to the selection of conditions and calibration thresholds, which can significantly influence the outcomes of the analysis [3,6].

Moreover, the integration of QCA with other theoretical perspectives remains a significant challenge. While some studies have attempted to bridge this gap, the process is often hampered by differences in assumptions and methodologies between QCA and more traditional causal theories [3,4]. This conceptual difficulty underscores the need for more systematic and theoretically grounded frameworks to support the application of QCA in international business research.

Despite these challenges, some methodological advancements have been made, such as the use of sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of QCA results. However, the overall consensus is that there is a need for greater methodological transparency, standardized procedures for condition selection and calibration, and the integration of complementary methods to enhance the interpretative power and reliability of QCA in international business research [1,2,4].
### 4.1 Subsection 4.1: Methodological Challenges and Limitations
The application of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in international business research faces several methodological challenges and limitations, as highlighted by multiple studies. One of the central critiques concerns the issue of data scarcity, particularly in international contexts where access to comprehensive and comparable datasets can be limited. This is emphasized in studies that note the requirement for a sufficient number of cases to ensure robust findings, which can be a significant constraint when dealing with small or fragmented datasets [3,6]. Such limitations may compromise the generalizability of QCA results, as the method relies heavily on case richness and diversity to identify meaningful configurations.

Another critical challenge lies in the calibration process, which is often described as subjective and highly dependent on the researcher’s judgment. This subjectivity can influence the outcomes of QCA, as the translation of qualitative conditions into crisp sets or fuzzy sets requires careful and often arbitrary decisions. This issue is repeatedly highlighted in the literature, with some studies noting that calibration difficulties can lead to inconsistencies in the interpretation of results, thereby affecting the reliability and validity of QCA findings [1,3]. Moreover, the interpretation of consistency and coverage scores is often complex, and these metrics may not always provide a clear indication of the strength or relevance of identified configurations.

In addition to these issues, the limitations of QCA in capturing causal mechanisms and dynamic processes have been widely acknowledged. While QCA excels at identifying configurational patterns, it is often criticized for its inability to fully account for the temporal and contextual nuances of international business phenomena. For instance, studies point out that QCA may not be well-suited for analyzing time-series data or capturing the evolving nature of corporate policy engagement over time [2,6]. This restricts its applicability in research areas where dynamism and change are central to the analysis.

Furthermore, the reliance on a priori selection of conditions and outcomes can introduce bias, as the researcher’s theoretical assumptions may shape the configuration analysis. This is particularly problematic in international business research, where the contextual diversity of cases can lead to varying interpretations of what constitutes a relevant condition. The sensitivity of QCA to such choices underscores the need for greater methodological transparency and rigor in its application [1,4].

Overall, while QCA offers valuable insights into complex, multi-causal phenomena in international business research, its methodological limitations—particularly data scarcity, calibration subjectivity, and challenges in capturing causality and dynamics—pose significant constraints. These issues highlight the importance of careful methodological design, transparent reporting, and the integration of complementary methods to enhance the robustness of QCA-based findings.
### 4.2 Subsection 4.2: Interpretative and Conceptual Challenges
Interpretative and conceptual challenges remain significant barriers to the effective application of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in international business research. A recurring issue highlighted across multiple studies is the difficulty in interpreting complex configurations, particularly when multiple conditions interact in non-linear ways. For instance, the paper by [1] points out that the interpretation of such configurations is often underexplored, and researchers have only begun to address these challenges. Similarly, [2] emphasizes that the role of time in causal relationships is not well addressed by QCA, suggesting that the temporal dynamics of international business contexts are not adequately captured by current QCA frameworks.

Another key challenge lies in the integration of QCA with other theoretical perspectives. While some studies have attempted to bridge this gap, the process remains limited. [4] notes that integrating QCA with other theoretical frameworks can be challenging due to differences in assumptions and methodologies. This is further echoed in [3], which highlights the conceptual difficulty of aligning QCA with theories that emphasize causality over configuration. These findings suggest that while QCA is a powerful tool for identifying configurations, its theoretical integration requires more nuanced and systematic approaches.

Moreover, the sensitivity of QCA results to the selection of conditions and calibration thresholds is a critical interpretative challenge. [6] underscores that the outcomes of QCA analyses can be significantly influenced by these choices, which raises concerns about the robustness and replicability of findings. This issue is compounded by the lack of standardized procedures for condition selection and calibration, as noted in [3]. To address this, the paper suggests that integrating QCA with other methods, such as mixed-methods approaches, could enhance interpretative clarity and methodological rigor.

Despite these challenges, some studies have made progress in addressing them. For example, [4] and [3] both discuss the use of sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of QCA results. These approaches provide a way to evaluate the stability of configurations and the influence of different parameter choices. However, the overall consensus is that more systematic and theoretically grounded frameworks are needed to support the application of QCA in international business research.

In summary, interpretative and conceptual challenges, particularly around the interpretation of complex configurations, the role of time in causal relationships, and the integration of QCA with other theoretical perspectives, remain significant hurdles. While some methodological advancements have been made, there is a clear need for more nuanced theoretical frameworks that can better support the interpretative and analytical demands of QCA in the context of international business research [1,2,3,4,6].
## 5. Section 5: Future Directions and Research Opportunities
The integration of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) with emerging methodologies, the expansion of its scope in international business (IB) research, and the enhancement of its methodological rigor and transparency represent critical areas for future development. These directions not only reflect the evolving landscape of IB research but also highlight the need for QCA to adapt and evolve in response to new theoretical and empirical challenges. By exploring these avenues, researchers can further strengthen the applicability, reliability, and relevance of QCA in analyzing complex, configuration-based phenomena in international business contexts [2,3,4].

The integration of QCA with computational models, machine learning, and mixed-methods approaches offers a promising pathway to enhance its analytical power. Computational models can help QCA manage larger and more complex datasets, while machine learning techniques can improve the calibration and identification of configurations. Mixed-methods approaches, on the other hand, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of causal mechanisms by combining qualitative and quantitative insights. These integrations not only address some of the limitations of traditional QCA but also open up new possibilities for empirical exploration and theoretical development [2,3,6].

Expanding the scope of QCA to emerging areas such as digital transformation, sustainability, and global value chains is another important direction. These domains are characterized by complex, context-sensitive interactions that traditional statistical methods may not fully capture. QCA's configurational logic is well-suited to uncovering multiple causal pathways and understanding how different combinations of conditions lead to specific outcomes. This makes it a valuable tool for investigating how firms navigate digitalization, align with sustainability goals, and operate within diverse institutional environments [2,3,6].

Finally, enhancing the methodological rigor and transparency of QCA is essential for improving its credibility and replicability. This involves standardizing calibration procedures, documenting condition selection, and validating findings through sensitivity analyses. Greater transparency in methodological choices not only facilitates replication but also reduces the risk of researcher bias. While some studies have called for more systematic reporting and validation strategies, there remains a need for consensus-driven guidelines and toolkits to support consistent QCA applications across studies [1,2,3].

In summary, the future of QCA in international business research lies in its ability to integrate with new methodologies, expand into novel research domains, and strengthen its methodological foundations. These directions not only reflect current research trends but also offer opportunities for QCA to contribute more effectively to the understanding of complex, configuration-based phenomena in global business environments.
### 5.1 Subsection 5.1: Integration with Emerging Methodologies
The integration of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) with emerging methodologies has been increasingly recognized as a promising avenue for enhancing its analytical capabilities in international business (IB) research. While some studies have not explicitly addressed this integration, others have proposed various strategies that highlight the potential benefits of combining QCA with computational models, machine learning, and mixed-methods approaches.  

Several papers emphasize the potential of computational models to improve QCA’s capacity to handle larger datasets and more complex configurational analyses. For instance, the paper by [4] suggests that QCA could benefit from the use of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance its analytical capabilities, particularly in identifying complex configurations. Similarly, [2] argues that integrating QCA with computational methods could improve the robustness of findings and provide more comprehensive insights into IB phenomena. These studies suggest that computational tools may help QCA overcome some of its limitations, such as the difficulty in analyzing high-dimensional data or capturing dynamic processes.  

In addition to computational models, the integration of QCA with machine learning techniques has also been proposed as a way to enhance configurational analysis. [3] suggests that machine learning could assist in the calibration process of QCA, thereby improving the identification of configurations. This aligns with the broader idea that hybrid approaches, which combine QCA with other analytical techniques, could enhance the explanatory power of QCA in IB research. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, researchers could potentially uncover patterns and relationships that might be overlooked using traditional QCA methods alone.  

Furthermore, the integration of QCA with mixed-methods approaches has been highlighted as a way to capture both the complexity of configurations and the underlying causal mechanisms. [3] and [2] both suggest that such hybrid approaches could provide a more nuanced understanding of IB phenomena by combining the strengths of qualitative and quantitative methods. This approach not only enriches the interpretive depth of QCA but also strengthens the validity of its findings by triangulating data sources and analytical techniques.  

While some studies, such as [6], do not explicitly discuss the integration of QCA with emerging methodologies, they still point toward the importance of incorporating more granular and real-time data sources to better capture corporate policy engagement. This suggests that even without direct integration with machine learning or big data analytics, QCA can still benefit from more dynamic and context-sensitive data collection strategies.  

In summary, the integration of QCA with emerging methodologies such as computational models, machine learning, and mixed-methods approaches presents significant opportunities for advancing its application in IB research. These integrations could enhance QCA’s ability to analyze complex configurations, improve the robustness of findings, and provide more comprehensive insights into international business phenomena. Future research should explore these hybrid approaches in greater depth, particularly through empirical case studies that demonstrate their practical value and methodological contributions.
### 5.2 Subsection 5.2: Expanding the Scope of QCA in International Business Research
Several studies have emphasized the potential for expanding the scope of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in international business (IB) research, particularly in emerging areas such as digital transformation, sustainability, and global value chains. These suggestions reflect a growing recognition of QCA’s ability to capture complex, configurational relationships that traditional statistical methods may overlook. For instance, the paper by [3] highlights the utility of QCA in analyzing how firms navigate the challenges of digitalization in international markets, suggesting that it can reveal distinct pathways through which digital strategies influence firm performance. Similarly, [2] argues that QCA could be particularly effective in examining the interplay between emerging trends like digital transformation and traditional IB factors, such as institutional environments.

In the realm of sustainability, [3] and [6] both propose that QCA can be used to explore how sustainability practices are configured across different institutional contexts. This approach allows researchers to identify multiple causal configurations that lead to sustainable outcomes, rather than assuming a single, uniform pathway. Such insights are particularly relevant in global supply chains, where institutional diversity and regulatory frameworks significantly influence corporate behavior. [2] further emphasizes that QCA can shed light on the dynamics of global value chains by analyzing how configurations of resources, capabilities, and institutional factors shape firm performance.

Moreover, the paper by [1] and [4] underscores the need for QCA to address new research questions related to digital transformation and sustainability. While these studies do not provide concrete examples of such applications, they collectively suggest that QCA’s configurational logic is well-suited for investigating multifaceted phenomena where multiple causal conditions interact. This is especially pertinent in the context of emerging challenges in international business, such as the integration of digital technologies across borders or the alignment of corporate strategies with global sustainability goals.

Overall, the literature indicates that QCA’s flexibility and emphasis on configuration make it a promising method for addressing complex, context-sensitive issues in international business research. By expanding its application to areas like digital transformation, sustainability, and global value chains, QCA can contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how firms adapt and perform in diverse and dynamic international environments.
### 5.3 Subsection 5.3: Enhancing Methodological Rigor and Transparency
Several studies have highlighted the critical need to enhance the methodological rigor and transparency of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in international business research. These recommendations emphasize the standardization of calibration procedures, the transparency of condition selection, and the validation of findings as key areas for improvement. For instance, the paper by [3,4] both advocate for more systematic and transparent reporting of QCA procedures. They argue that standardizing calibration processes can significantly reduce variability in results, thereby increasing the reliability of QCA findings. Similarly, [1,2] stress the importance of documenting methodological choices, particularly in the selection of conditions, to ensure that studies are both replicable and interpretable.

The emphasis on transparency is not merely a procedural suggestion but a fundamental step toward enhancing the credibility of QCA studies. As noted in [6], greater transparency in the selection of conditions and calibration procedures can help mitigate the risk of researcher bias and improve the overall robustness of findings. This aligns with the broader call for more detailed justifications for methodological choices, as highlighted in [2,3]. These studies suggest that researchers should not only document their procedures but also provide clear rationales for their decisions, particularly in cases where multiple configurations could be plausible.

In addition to transparency, standardization plays a crucial role in improving the replicability of QCA studies. While several papers acknowledge the importance of standardizing calibration procedures, none of them provide detailed guidelines or best practices for implementation. This gap in the literature suggests a need for further methodological development, particularly in the form of consensus-driven frameworks or toolkits that can guide researchers in applying QCA consistently. The lack of such resources may contribute to the variability in QCA applications and limit the generalizability of findings across studies.

To address these challenges, researchers are encouraged to adopt a multi-pronged approach. First, they should document all stages of the QCA process, including the selection of conditions, calibration decisions, and validation strategies. Second, they should incorporate sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of their findings, as recommended by [3]. Third, they should seek to align their methodologies with emerging standards in configurational research, as outlined in [1]. By implementing these steps, researchers can significantly enhance the credibility, replicability, and robustness of their QCA studies.
