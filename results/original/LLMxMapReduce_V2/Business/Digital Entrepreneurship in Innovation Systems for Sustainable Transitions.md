# 0. Digital Entrepreneurship in Innovation Systems for Sustainable Transitions

## 1. Section 1: Introduction and Contextual Background
Digital entrepreneurship has been increasingly recognized as a transformative force within innovation systems, particularly in the context of sustainable transitions. The concept is defined across the reviewed papers with a shared emphasis on the integration of digital tools and technologies into entrepreneurial practices. For instance, [1] describes digital entrepreneurship as a pivotal force in innovation systems, emphasizing the transformation of traditional practices through data-driven decision-making, digital platforms, and digital ecosystems. Similarly, [3] highlights the role of Digital Entrepreneurial Ecosystems (DEEs) in redefining entrepreneurial practices, with a focus on their implications for sustainability goals. These definitions align with the broader discourse on how digital technologies are reshaping the entrepreneurial landscape.

The relationship between digital entrepreneurship and innovation systems is further elaborated in the context of technological disruption and platform-based business models. [1] underscores the significance of digital platforms in fostering innovation, while [3] emphasizes the role of digital ecosystems in driving growth and innovation. These perspectives highlight a common theme: the increasing reliance on digital infrastructure to support new forms of value creation and knowledge exchange.

In terms of contextual backgrounds, the papers position digital entrepreneurship within the sustainability discourse by linking it to broader global challenges. [2] frames digital entrepreneurship as a critical mechanism for addressing the digital divide and promoting inclusive sustainable development, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In contrast, [1] situates digital entrepreneurship within the context of global digitalization and environmental challenges, suggesting that digital technologies can both exacerbate and mitigate sustainability issues. The study from Latin America, as presented in [3], provides a regional perspective, demonstrating how digital entrepreneurship can be leveraged to support local sustainability initiatives.

Despite these overlapping themes, the contextual framing of digital entrepreneurship varies across the papers. While some focus on the global implications of digital transformation, others emphasize regional or community-level impacts. This variation reflects the diverse ways in which digital entrepreneurship is understood and applied within different innovation systems. However, all papers concur that digital entrepreneurship is not merely a technological phenomenon but a socio-economic process that has significant implications for sustainable development.
## 2. Section 2: Theoretical Frameworks and Conceptual Models
Section 2 examines the theoretical underpinnings that shape the understanding of digital entrepreneurship within innovation systems and sustainable transitions. The literature reveals a diversity of theoretical perspectives, with some studies emphasizing institutional and organizational theories, while others integrate innovation and sustainability paradigms. These frameworks collectively contribute to a more holistic understanding of how digital entrepreneurship interacts with systemic and environmental dynamics. However, the integration of these theories remains uneven, with varying degrees of depth and coherence across the literature.

Institutional and organizational theories, as highlighted in the paper titled *Digital Entrepreneurship in Innovation Systems for Sustainable Transitions* [1], provide a foundational lens for analyzing how regulatory environments, policy frameworks, and organizational structures influence digital entrepreneurial activities. The study employs institutional theory to argue that supportive policies and adaptive organizational structures are critical for fostering digital innovation aligned with sustainability goals. However, the analysis is limited by its lack of empirical validation and its narrow focus on top-down institutional pressures, without sufficient attention to the bottom-up role of digital entrepreneurs in shaping institutional change. The paper also references the resource-based view and innovation diffusion theory, but the integration of these perspectives is superficial, with limited discussion on their interplay and mutual reinforcement.

In contrast, the integration of innovation and sustainability theories is less consistent across the literature. While the same paper [1] references the linear model of innovation, the quadruple helix model, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it does not fully elaborate on how these theories interact or how they can be operationalized in practice. The linear model is used to frame digital entrepreneurs as knowledge intermediaries, while the quadruple helix model emphasizes multi-stakeholder collaboration. However, the paper lacks a clear synthesis of these models, and the connection between digital entrepreneurship and the SDGs remains underdeveloped. Another study, *Impacts of Digital Entrepreneurial Ecosystems on Sustainable Development: Insights from Latin America* [3], does not explicitly engage with these theoretical frameworks, highlighting a gap in the literature where empirical analyses often lack theoretical grounding.

The conceptual models proposed in the literature vary in their scope and complexity. Some studies present models that link digital entrepreneurship to innovation systems and sustainability through mechanisms such as digital capabilities, network dynamics, and systemic change. However, these models are often descriptive rather than explanatory, and they do not consistently account for the dynamic and evolving nature of digital entrepreneurial ecosystems. The interplay between different theoretical frameworks—such as institutional, resource-based, and innovation theories—remains underexplored, limiting the ability to develop a unified conceptual model that captures the multifaceted nature of digital entrepreneurship in sustainable transitions.

Future research should aim to synthesize these theoretical perspectives into a more integrated framework that accounts for the complex interactions between digital entrepreneurship, innovation systems, and sustainability. This could involve developing a more dynamic model that incorporates both top-down institutional influences and bottom-up entrepreneurial agency, as well as operationalizing the SDGs in the context of digital entrepreneurial activities. Additionally, there is a need for more empirical studies that validate and extend the theoretical insights presented in the literature, particularly through case studies and longitudinal analyses. By addressing these gaps, future research can contribute to a more robust and actionable understanding of how digital entrepreneurship can drive sustainable innovation systems.
### 2.1 Subsection 2.1: Institutional and Organizational Theories
Institutional and organizational theories provide a critical lens through which the adoption of digital entrepreneurship within sustainable transitions can be analyzed. The paper titled *Digital Entrepreneurship in Innovation Systems for Sustainable Transitions* applies institutional theory to examine how policy, regulation, and organizational structures shape digital entrepreneurial activities. According to this study, institutional factors play a pivotal role in either enabling or constraining digital innovation, particularly in the context of sustainable development. The authors argue that supportive regulatory frameworks and adaptive organizational structures are essential for fostering digital entrepreneurship that aligns with broader sustainability goals. However, the analysis is constrained by its limited scope and lack of empirical validation through in-depth case studies or quantitative data [1].

While this paper offers a theoretical foundation, it does not fully explore the comparative dynamics between different institutional and organizational models. For instance, the role of institutional isomorphism—where organizations adopt practices to align with external pressures—remains underexplored in the context of digital entrepreneurship. Additionally, the study does not engage with alternative theoretical perspectives, such as resource-based view or dynamic capabilities theory, which could provide deeper insights into how organizations leverage internal and external resources to drive digital innovation.

The absence of empirical evidence in this study highlights a gap in the current literature. Future research could benefit from integrating qualitative case studies or longitudinal analyses to better understand the interplay between institutional pressures and digital entrepreneurial outcomes. Furthermore, the paper’s focus on policy and regulation suggests a top-down approach, but it does not sufficiently address the bottom-up mechanisms through which digital entrepreneurs influence institutional change. This omission limits the applicability of the findings to real-world contexts where digital entrepreneurs often act as agents of institutional transformation.

In terms of policy and practice, the study implies that policymakers should prioritize creating flexible regulatory environments that encourage experimentation and innovation while ensuring alignment with sustainability objectives. For organizations, the findings suggest the need for adaptive structures that can accommodate rapid technological changes and evolving institutional demands. However, without robust empirical support, these recommendations remain largely speculative.

Overall, while the paper contributes to the theoretical understanding of digital entrepreneurship through institutional and organizational lenses, its limited empirical grounding and narrow focus on policy and regulation suggest a need for more comprehensive and multi-faceted analyses in future studies.
### 2.2 Subsection 2.2: Innovation and Sustainability Theories
The integration of innovation and sustainability theories with digital entrepreneurship is a central theme in the literature, though the depth and clarity of this integration vary across studies. The paper titled *Digital Entrepreneurship in Innovation Systems for Sustainable Transitions* [1] explicitly references key theoretical frameworks, including the linear model of innovation, the quadruple helix model, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These theories are positioned as foundational elements for understanding how digital entrepreneurship can contribute to sustainable development. However, the paper falls short of providing a comprehensive synthesis of how these theories interact within the context of digital entrepreneurial activities.

The linear model of innovation, which emphasizes a sequential process from research to market, is often used to frame the role of digital entrepreneurs as knowledge intermediaries who bridge technological advancements with societal needs. In contrast, the quadruple helix model, which incorporates government, industry, academia, and civil society, offers a more dynamic and collaborative perspective on innovation ecosystems. Digital entrepreneurship, as conceptualized in the paper, is seen as a key actor within this model, leveraging digital technologies to foster multi-stakeholder collaboration and drive sustainable transitions. However, the paper does not fully elaborate on how digital entrepreneurs navigate or influence the interactions among these four helices.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a normative framework for evaluating the impact of digital entrepreneurship on sustainability. The paper suggests that digital entrepreneurs can align their ventures with specific SDGs, such as SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), by developing technologies that address environmental and social challenges. Yet, the theoretical linkages between digital entrepreneurship and the SDGs remain underdeveloped, with limited discussion on how these goals are operationalized in practice.

In comparison, the paper *Impacts of Digital Entrepreneurial Ecosystems on Sustainable Development: Insights from Latin America* [3] does not explicitly engage with innovation or sustainability theories, which limits its contribution to this subsection. This absence highlights a gap in the literature, where empirical studies often lack the theoretical grounding necessary to situate digital entrepreneurship within broader innovation and sustainability paradigms.

To better understand the role of digital entrepreneurship in driving sustainable transitions, a synthesis of these theories is essential. The linear model offers a structural understanding of innovation processes, while the quadruple helix model emphasizes the importance of stakeholder collaboration. The SDGs provide a normative lens through which the impact of digital entrepreneurship can be evaluated. A more integrated approach would recognize that digital entrepreneurs operate within complex, multi-layered systems where technological, social, and environmental factors intersect. By combining these theoretical perspectives, future research can develop a more nuanced and actionable framework for analyzing how digital entrepreneurship contributes to sustainable innovation systems.

This synthesis suggests that digital entrepreneurship is not merely a byproduct of technological progress but an active force in shaping the trajectory of innovation and sustainability. It calls for a rethinking of traditional innovation models to incorporate the dynamic and adaptive nature of digital entrepreneurial activities. Future studies should focus on how digital entrepreneurs leverage or challenge existing theoretical frameworks to create value in the context of sustainable transitions.
## 3. Section 3: Digital Entrepreneurship and Innovation Systems
Digital entrepreneurship is increasingly recognized as a pivotal force in shaping and being shaped by innovation systems, with varying conceptualizations of the relationship between digital entrepreneurs and systemic actors. The literature reveals a spectrum of perspectives, ranging from broad, systemic analyses to more localized, practice-oriented studies. While some contributions emphasize the structural and institutional dimensions of digital platforms and networked innovation, others focus on the operational and contextual factors that influence entrepreneurial outcomes. This section synthesizes these diverse viewpoints, highlighting the implications for policy and innovation management.

The interaction between digital entrepreneurs and systemic actors—such as firms, governments, and civil society—is mediated through digital platforms and ecosystems, which serve as both facilitators and potential constraints. Studies such as [1] provide a general framework for understanding how digital platforms enable or hinder entrepreneurial activities, but they often lack detailed empirical evidence or specific examples. In contrast, [3] offers a more structured analysis, identifying key components—such as Networking, Digital Protection, and Digital Tech Transfer—that are critical to the functioning of digital entrepreneurial ecosystems (DEEs). These components are positioned as essential for fostering innovation and sustainable development, suggesting that digital platforms can be strategically designed to enhance systemic integration and entrepreneurial capacity.

Networked innovation and collaboration further complicate the relationship between digital entrepreneurs and innovation systems. Both studies underscore the role of digital tools in enabling knowledge sharing, co-creation, and the formation of collaborative ecosystems. However, they also highlight challenges such as trust-building, information asymmetry, and the alignment of goals across diverse stakeholders. The lack of empirical validation in [1] contrasts with the context-specific insights provided by [3], which, while more grounded, is limited in geographic scope. This divergence points to the need for more comprehensive and contextually sensitive research that bridges macro-level platform dynamics with micro-level entrepreneurial practices.

The implications for policy and innovation management are significant. Effective strategies must address both the structural and operational dimensions of digital ecosystems, including open data policies, digital literacy initiatives, and responsive platform governance models. Moreover, the integration of localized components, as identified in the Latin American study, can provide a more tailored approach to supporting digital entrepreneurship in different socio-economic contexts. Future research should aim to fill existing gaps by incorporating more empirical studies that explore the interplay between digital tools, organizational structures, and collaborative outcomes in diverse settings. This will not only enhance the resilience of digital ecosystems but also contribute to broader goals of sustainable development and systemic innovation.
### 3.1 Subsection 3.1: Digital Platforms and Ecosystems
Digital platforms and ecosystems play a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of digital entrepreneurship, acting as both enablers and potential barriers. The literature highlights that these platforms influence entrepreneurial activities through mechanisms such as platform governance, data access, and the adoption of platform-based business models. However, the depth of analysis varies significantly across studies. For instance, the paper titled *digital_entrepreneurship_in_innovation_systems_for_sustainable_transitions* provides a general overview of how digital platforms function in this context, but it lacks a comprehensive examination of the specific challenges and opportunities that arise within platform ecosystems [1].

In contrast, the study *impacts_of_digital_entrepreneurial_ecosystems_on_sustainable_development_insights_from_latin_america* offers a more structured analysis, identifying three key components—Networking, Digital Protection, and Digital Tech Transfer—as critical to the functioning of digital entrepreneurial ecosystems (DEEs) in Latin American contexts. These components are positioned as facilitators of innovation and sustainable development, suggesting that digital platforms can be strategically designed to enhance entrepreneurial capabilities and systemic integration. This perspective contrasts with the more general and less detailed approach of the first study, which fails to delineate the specific mechanisms through which platform dynamics influence entrepreneurial outcomes.

Comparing these two studies reveals a trend in the literature: while some contributions emphasize the broader implications of digital platforms, others focus on localized, actionable components that can be leveraged to support digital entrepreneurship. The former tends to highlight the structural and systemic aspects of platform ecosystems, while the latter offers practical insights into how digital ecosystems can be optimized for inclusive growth. This divergence suggests a need for more integrated frameworks that bridge macro-level platform dynamics with micro-level entrepreneurial practices.

The impact of digital platforms on innovation systems is further complicated by issues of platform governance and data access. These factors can either empower or constrain digital entrepreneurs, depending on the design and policies of the platform. For example, platforms that prioritize open data access and transparent governance structures may foster greater innovation and inclusivity, whereas those with restrictive policies may limit the potential of digital entrepreneurs, particularly in developing regions. The study from Latin America underscores the importance of Digital Protection in this context, indicating that safeguarding digital assets and ensuring equitable access are essential for sustainable digital entrepreneurship.

To foster more inclusive digital ecosystems, strategies must be developed that address both the structural and operational dimensions of platform ecosystems. This includes promoting open data policies, enhancing digital literacy among entrepreneurs, and ensuring that platform governance models are responsive to the needs of diverse stakeholders. Additionally, the integration of localized components such as those identified in the Latin American study—Networking, Digital Protection, and Digital Tech Transfer—can provide a more tailored approach to supporting digital entrepreneurship in different socio-economic contexts. Such strategies would not only enhance the resilience of digital ecosystems but also contribute to broader goals of sustainable development and systemic innovation.
### 3.2 Subsection 3.2: Networked Innovation and Collaboration
Networked innovation and collaboration are central to the dynamics of digital entrepreneurship, as evidenced by the analyses presented in the reviewed literature. Both [1,3] emphasize the role of digital tools in fostering knowledge sharing, co-creation, and the formation of collaborative ecosystems. However, their approaches differ in depth and focus. The former provides a general overview of how digital entrepreneurs engage in networked innovation through partnerships and open innovation frameworks, while the latter offers a more context-specific analysis, drawing from insights in Latin America to illustrate the practical implications of such collaborations for sustainable development.

Despite these differences, both studies identify common challenges in cross-organizational collaboration. These include issues related to trust-building, information asymmetry, and the alignment of goals across diverse stakeholders. The lack of empirical evidence in [1] limits the depth of its analysis, whereas [3] provides a more grounded perspective, albeit with a narrower geographic scope. This suggests that while the conceptual framework of networked innovation is well-established, the empirical validation of its mechanisms remains underdeveloped.

Digital tools, as highlighted in both studies, play a dual role in networked innovation. On one hand, they enable real-time communication, data sharing, and the creation of virtual communities that support collaborative processes. On the other hand, they can also pose barriers, such as technological incompatibility, data security concerns, and the digital divide that may exclude certain actors from participating effectively. The potential of these tools to enhance collaboration is thus contingent upon the context in which they are deployed, the capabilities of the actors involved, and the institutional frameworks that govern their use.

In conclusion, while the literature underscores the transformative potential of networked innovation in digital entrepreneurship, it also reveals significant gaps in understanding the complexities of cross-organizational collaboration. Future research should aim to bridge these gaps by incorporating more empirical studies that explore the interplay between digital tools, organizational structures, and collaborative outcomes in diverse settings [1,3].
## 4. Section 4: Digital Entrepreneurship and Sustainable Transitions
Digital entrepreneurship plays a pivotal role in shaping sustainable transitions by influencing environmental, social, and economic dimensions of development. This section synthesizes the findings from key studies to evaluate the multifaceted contributions and limitations of digital entrepreneurship in advancing sustainability. The analysis reveals that digital entrepreneurship is increasingly recognized as a catalyst for green innovation, economic growth, and social inclusion, yet its environmental and social impacts remain complex and context-dependent.

Two core perspectives emerge from the reviewed literature. One study highlights the potential of digital entrepreneurs to drive environmental sustainability through green innovation, energy efficiency, and the digitalization of sustainable practices [1]. It underscores the capacity of digital technologies to optimize resource use and support sustainable business models. However, this perspective is critiqued for its limited consideration of the environmental costs associated with digital infrastructures, such as energy consumption and e-waste generation. Another study, focusing on digital entrepreneurial ecosystems (DEEs) in Latin America, presents a more nuanced view, acknowledging both the environmental benefits and challenges of digitalization [3]. It emphasizes the dual role of digital technologies in both contributing to and mitigating environmental degradation, while also highlighting the need for systemic approaches to address the sustainability of digital systems.

In terms of social and economic impacts, digital entrepreneurship is shown to foster job creation, enhance digital inclusion, and support small and medium enterprises (SMEs), particularly in developing regions. Case studies from Kenya, the Philippines, and Rwanda illustrate the potential of digital initiatives to stimulate local economies and promote inclusive growth. However, the literature also points to significant gaps in empirical research, particularly in assessing the extent to which digital entrepreneurship reduces or exacerbates social inequalities. While some studies suggest that digital entrepreneurship can serve as a tool for social inclusion, the lack of robust data and case studies limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions about its impact on marginalized communities.

Overall, the findings indicate that digital entrepreneurship holds considerable potential as a driver of sustainable transitions, but its effectiveness is contingent on addressing key challenges, including environmental trade-offs, social equity concerns, and the need for more rigorous empirical research. Future research should aim to integrate environmental, social, and economic dimensions more systematically, while also exploring the long-term implications of digitalization for sustainability. By doing so, stakeholders can better harness the transformative power of digital entrepreneurship to achieve more equitable and resilient development outcomes.
### 4.1 Subsection 4.1: Environmental Impacts and Green Innovation
The environmental perspectives of digital entrepreneurship are multifaceted, as reflected in the analyses of two key studies. One paper emphasizes the role of digital entrepreneurs in advancing environmental sustainability through green innovation, energy efficiency, and the digitalization of sustainable practices [1]. It highlights the potential of digital technologies to mitigate environmental harm, particularly through the optimization of resource use and the facilitation of sustainable business models. However, this study does not provide a detailed examination of the carbon footprint associated with digital systems or the trade-offs between digitalization and environmental impact, which limits the depth of its environmental analysis.

In contrast, another study focuses specifically on the environmental impacts of digital entrepreneurial ecosystems (DEEs), particularly in the context of Latin America [3]. This paper acknowledges the dual role of digital technologies as both contributors to and solutions for environmental challenges. On one hand, it recognizes the capacity of digital tools to support green innovation, reduce the carbon footprint of traditional industries, and enhance environmental monitoring and management. On the other hand, it identifies significant challenges, including the high energy consumption of digital infrastructures and the growing issue of e-waste, which can undermine the sustainability benefits of digitalization.

Comparing these two perspectives, it becomes evident that while both studies recognize the potential of digital technologies to drive environmental sustainability, they differ in their depth of analysis and the scope of their environmental concerns. The first study offers a more optimistic outlook, focusing on the positive contributions of digital entrepreneurship to green innovation, while the second adopts a more critical stance, emphasizing the need to address the environmental costs associated with digital systems.

This contrast underscores the importance of a balanced view of digital technologies' environmental impacts. While digital entrepreneurship can be a powerful driver of green innovation and sustainable transitions, it is essential to consider the broader environmental implications, including energy consumption, e-waste generation, and the carbon footprint of digital infrastructures. Future research should aim to integrate these dimensions more systematically, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how digital technologies can be harnessed for sustainable development without exacerbating environmental challenges.
### 4.2 Subsection 4.2: Social and Economic Impacts
Digital entrepreneurship has emerged as a significant driver of both social and economic transformation, with varying implications for equity and inclusivity. The analysis of existing literature reveals that while digital entrepreneurship can foster job creation, enhance digital inclusion, and support small and medium enterprises (SMEs), its impact on social inequalities remains complex and context-dependent. 

Several studies highlight the positive economic effects of digital entrepreneurship, particularly in developing regions. For instance, the DigiKen initiative in Kenya is projected to generate 4,500 direct jobs and approximately 20,000 indirect jobs by 2027, while supporting 150 micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in developing digital platforms [2]. Similarly, in the Philippines, digital entrepreneurship initiatives aim to enhance the digital capacities of MSMEs, which are vital to employment and economic output. In Rwanda, digital entrepreneurship is being leveraged to support small-scale cross-border traders, thereby promoting economic resilience and inclusivity. These case studies underscore the potential of digital entrepreneurship to stimulate local economies and create opportunities for marginalized groups.

However, the literature also reveals that the benefits of digital entrepreneurship are not uniformly distributed. While the paper on digital entrepreneurial ecosystems (DEEs) in Latin America emphasizes the role of digital entrepreneurs in addressing social challenges and promoting equitable development [3], it does not provide empirical evidence or detailed case studies to substantiate these claims. Similarly, another paper on digital entrepreneurship in innovation systems for sustainable transitions acknowledges the potential of digital entrepreneurs to contribute to sustainable development but lacks the empirical grounding necessary to fully assess their impact on social inequalities [1].

This gap in empirical research suggests that while digital entrepreneurship is often portrayed as a tool for inclusive growth, its actual impact on reducing or exacerbating social inequalities remains underexplored. Some studies suggest that digital entrepreneurship can act as a catalyst for social inclusion by providing new opportunities for marginalized communities, particularly in regions with limited access to traditional economic structures. However, without robust data and case studies, it is difficult to determine whether these initiatives are effectively reaching the most vulnerable populations or if they risk reinforcing existing disparities.

To ensure more equitable outcomes, several recommendations can be drawn from the existing literature. First, there is a need for more rigorous empirical research that examines the social and economic impacts of digital entrepreneurship across different regions and demographic groups. Second, policy frameworks should be designed to support digital entrepreneurs from underrepresented communities, ensuring that they have access to the necessary resources, training, and networks. Third, digital entrepreneurship initiatives should be integrated with broader development strategies that address structural inequalities, such as access to education, infrastructure, and financial services. Finally, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms should be established to track the long-term effects of digital entrepreneurship on social and economic equity, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation of strategies.

In conclusion, while digital entrepreneurship holds significant promise for driving sustainable transitions, its potential to reduce social inequalities remains contingent on the design, implementation, and evaluation of initiatives. By addressing the gaps in current research and adopting a more inclusive and evidence-based approach, stakeholders can harness the power of digital entrepreneurship to create more equitable and resilient societies.
## 5. Section 5: Challenges and Limitations
Section 5 examines the multifaceted challenges and limitations that digital entrepreneurship encounters within innovation systems aimed at fostering sustainable transitions. The analysis draws on insights from multiple studies, highlighting how different papers frame the barriers to digital entrepreneurship and their implications for policy and practice. A central theme across the literature is the interplay between technological and resource constraints, as well as regulatory and institutional obstacles, which collectively hinder the growth and sustainability of digital entrepreneurial activities.

Technological and resource barriers are consistently identified as critical challenges, particularly in regions with underdeveloped digital infrastructure and limited access to digital tools. Studies such as [1,3] emphasize the importance of data access, infrastructure availability, and digital skills in enabling digital entrepreneurship. However, these studies are often criticized for their lack of empirical evidence and detailed case studies. In contrast, [2] provides more concrete data, highlighting the global scale of the digital divide and the urgent need for capacity-building initiatives and public-private partnerships to address these disparities.

Regulatory and institutional barriers also emerge as significant constraints, with studies pointing to issues such as data privacy, intellectual property rights, and policy fragmentation. While [1,3] discuss these challenges, they often lack a nuanced, context-specific analysis. The paper [2] implicitly underscores the importance of institutional support and policy alignment, suggesting that cross-institutional collaboration is essential for creating an enabling environment for digital entrepreneurship.

Despite these insights, the existing literature reveals a notable gap in the comparative analysis of challenges across different regions and sectors. There is a need for more context-sensitive frameworks that account for the diverse regulatory and institutional landscapes in which digital entrepreneurship operates. Furthermore, the studies collectively emphasize the importance of developing adaptive and inclusive regulatory models that balance innovation with accountability, ensuring that digital entrepreneurship contributes meaningfully to sustainable transitions.

In conclusion, the literature underscores the necessity of more supportive innovation ecosystems that address both technological and regulatory barriers. The findings suggest that fostering digital entrepreneurship requires a multi-faceted approach, involving infrastructure development, digital skill enhancement, and the creation of coherent policy frameworks. Future research should focus on generating empirical evidence to substantiate these claims and on developing regionally tailored strategies that promote inclusive and sustainable digital entrepreneurial ecosystems.
### 5.1 Subsection 5.1: Technological and Resource Barriers
Technological and resource barriers represent significant challenges to the development of digital entrepreneurship, particularly in regions with limited infrastructure and access to digital tools. Several studies highlight the critical role of data access, infrastructure availability, and digital skills in shaping the entrepreneurial landscape. For instance, the paper by [1] outlines how technological limitations and resource constraints hinder digital entrepreneurship, emphasizing the importance of access to data, infrastructure, and digital skills. However, the discussion is brief and lacks empirical data or case studies to substantiate these claims. This gap in evidence-based analysis is also noted in [3], which similarly addresses the challenges faced by digital entrepreneurs in Latin America but does not provide detailed empirical support for its assertions.

In contrast, [2] offers a more concrete analysis of the issue, noting that 2.6 billion people globally lack reliable and affordable internet access, which directly limits their participation in digital entrepreneurship. This paper underscores the importance of digital literacy and training, particularly in marginalized communities, as a means to overcome these barriers. It also highlights the need for targeted interventions to address the digital divide, suggesting that capacity building and public-private partnerships could play a pivotal role in facilitating more inclusive digital entrepreneurial ecosystems.

Comparing these studies reveals a common theme: the interplay between technological infrastructure and resource availability as key determinants of digital entrepreneurship success. While [1] and [3] provide theoretical insights, they fall short in offering empirical validation. On the other hand, [2] presents more actionable data, emphasizing the urgency of addressing infrastructure gaps and the need for targeted training programs.

To address these challenges, the literature suggests that capacity building initiatives, such as digital literacy programs and skill development workshops, can enhance the ability of individuals to engage in digital entrepreneurship. Additionally, public-private partnerships are proposed as a viable solution to bridge the infrastructure gap, particularly in developing regions. These collaborations can facilitate the deployment of digital infrastructure and ensure that marginalized communities have access to the tools and resources necessary for digital participation.

In conclusion, while the existing literature identifies technological and resource barriers as critical obstacles to digital entrepreneurship, there is a need for more empirical research to substantiate these claims. The findings from these studies collectively point toward the importance of infrastructure development, digital skill enhancement, and collaborative efforts between public and private sectors to foster sustainable digital entrepreneurial ecosystems.
### 5.2 Subsection 5.2: Regulatory and Institutional Barriers
Regulatory and institutional barriers play a critical role in shaping the trajectory of digital entrepreneurship, particularly within innovation systems aimed at fostering sustainable transitions. While the extent to which these barriers are explicitly analyzed varies across studies, several key themes emerge from the available literature. The paper titled *Digital Entrepreneurship in Innovation Systems for Sustainable Transitions* highlights that regulatory challenges such as data privacy, intellectual property rights, and policy fragmentation significantly impede the growth of digital entrepreneurial activities [1]. However, the analysis is constrained by its limited scope, as it does not explore how these challenges manifest differently across regions or sectors. Similarly, *Impacts of Digital Entrepreneurial Ecosystems on Sustainable Development: Insights from Latin America* identifies similar regulatory hurdles, emphasizing that the absence of coherent policy frameworks undermines the sustainability of digital entrepreneurial ecosystems in the region [3].

In contrast, *The Dawn of Digital Entrepreneurship: Joint SDG Fund Forges New Paths for Sustainability* does not directly engage with regulatory or institutional barriers, but it implicitly underscores the importance of institutional support and policy alignment in enabling digital entrepreneurship for sustainable development. The involvement of the UN Joint SDG Fund and various UN agencies in the case studies suggests that cross-institutional collaboration is essential for addressing systemic challenges, including those related to regulatory coherence and digital inclusion [2].

Despite these insights, the existing literature reveals a gap in the comparative analysis of regulatory perspectives across different contexts. While both *Digital Entrepreneurship in Innovation Systems for Sustainable Transitions* and *Impacts of Digital Entrepreneurial Ecosystems on Sustainable Development: Insights from Latin America* point to the need for more integrated and adaptive regulatory frameworks, neither provides a comprehensive examination of how such frameworks could be tailored to specific regional or sectoral needs. This suggests that future research should focus on developing context-sensitive regulatory models that balance innovation with accountability, ensuring that digital entrepreneurship contributes meaningfully to sustainable transitions.

The need for adaptive and inclusive regulatory frameworks is further reinforced by the recognition that digital entrepreneurship operates within complex institutional environments. As highlighted in the literature, regulatory policies must evolve in tandem with technological advancements and shifting market dynamics. This requires not only greater coordination among policymakers, entrepreneurs, and civil society but also a more nuanced understanding of how institutional structures either enable or constrain digital entrepreneurial activities. In this regard, the findings of the reviewed studies collectively argue for a more proactive and participatory approach to regulatory design, one that prioritizes inclusivity, flexibility, and long-term sustainability.
## 6. Section 6: Future Research Directions and Opportunities
Section 6 examines the future research directions and opportunities in digital entrepreneurship within the context of innovation systems and sustainable transitions. Drawing from the insights of multiple studies, this section identifies key methodological advancements, interdisciplinary and policy opportunities, and emerging research gaps that warrant further investigation. The literature consistently emphasizes the need for more robust and integrated approaches to studying digital entrepreneurship, particularly in relation to its role in fostering sustainable transitions. 

Methodologically, the existing research highlights the increasing use of big data analytics, computational modeling, and mixed-methods approaches to capture the complexity of digital entrepreneurial activities [1,3]. While these techniques offer valuable insights, they often lack detailed practical applications or specific research questions that could guide empirical studies. Additionally, the integration of statistical methods such as Principal Component Regression (PCR), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), and fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA 3.0) has shown promise in uncovering causal relationships and non-linear interactions within digital entrepreneurial ecosystems. A hybrid methodological framework combining big data analytics, statistical regression, and configurational analysis is proposed to enhance the depth and breadth of empirical investigations. This approach not only improves the robustness of findings but also facilitates cross-regional comparisons and the development of generalizable theories.

In terms of interdisciplinary and policy opportunities, the literature underscores the importance of integrating digital entrepreneurship with environmental science, public policy, and social innovation to achieve more holistic and impactful sustainable transitions [1,3]. However, the recommendations for cross-disciplinary collaboration remain somewhat generic, with limited actionable strategies for implementation. Future research should focus on developing structured methodologies for interdisciplinary research, including shared metrics, joint research agendas, and policy instruments that promote knowledge exchange across sectors. Moreover, the development of policy frameworks that incentivize sustainable digital innovation, regulate technological advancements in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and ensure stakeholder engagement across public, private, and civil society sectors is critical for translating theoretical insights into practical outcomes.

Despite the growing body of literature, significant gaps remain in the current research. These include the need for more empirical studies to evaluate the long-term socio-economic and environmental impacts of digital entrepreneurial initiatives, particularly in marginalized communities. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive models that integrate digital entrepreneurship with broader innovation systems and sustainable development frameworks. Future research should also explore the role of digital entrepreneurship in fostering resilience and inclusivity within innovation ecosystems, as well as the potential for leveraging digital technologies to address systemic challenges in sustainability transitions. By addressing these gaps, researchers can contribute to the development of a more coherent and actionable research agenda that bridges digital entrepreneurship with innovation systems and sustainable transitions.
### 6.1 Subsection 6.1: Methodological Advancements
The study of digital entrepreneurship within innovation systems has seen significant methodological developments, with researchers employing a range of quantitative and qualitative techniques to explore its role in sustainable transitions. One paper emphasizes the use of big data analytics and computational modeling as tools for capturing the dynamic and complex nature of digital entrepreneurial activities [1]. These methods enable the analysis of large-scale datasets and the simulation of entrepreneurial processes, offering a macro-level understanding of how digital innovations interact with broader systemic changes. However, the paper does not provide a detailed discussion on the practical application of these methods or the specific research questions they can address, which limits their direct applicability in empirical studies [1].

In contrast, another study from Latin America introduces a set of statistical and comparative methods, including Principal Component Regression (PCR), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), and fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA 3.0), to examine the impact of digital entrepreneurial ecosystems (DEEs) on sustainable development [3]. These approaches allow for the identification of multiple pathways through which DEEs contribute to sustainability, capturing both quantitative relationships and qualitative configurations. The use of fsQCA 3.0, in particular, is notable for its ability to handle complex causal relationships and to uncover non-linear interactions between variables, which is critical in understanding the multifaceted nature of digital entrepreneurship in innovation systems.

Comparing these methodological approaches reveals a complementary relationship between quantitative and qualitative techniques. While big data analytics and computational modeling offer a broad, data-driven perspective on digital entrepreneurial dynamics, statistical methods like PCR and PLSR provide more precise insights into the causal mechanisms linking DEEs to sustainability outcomes. The fsQCA 3.0 method, by contrast, bridges the gap between these two paradigms by integrating both quantitative and qualitative dimensions of analysis. This suggests that a more holistic understanding of digital entrepreneurship can be achieved through a hybrid methodological framework that combines the strengths of each approach.

To this end, a proposed hybrid framework integrates big data analytics for capturing large-scale trends, statistical regression techniques for identifying key drivers of sustainable transitions, and fsQCA 3.0 for exploring the configurational logic of successful digital entrepreneurial ecosystems. This approach not only enhances the robustness of empirical findings but also allows for a more nuanced interpretation of how digital entrepreneurship operates within innovation systems. By combining these methods, researchers can better address the complexity of digital entrepreneurial processes and their implications for sustainable development. Such a framework also facilitates cross-regional comparisons and the testing of generalizable theories, which is essential for advancing the field of digital entrepreneurship in innovation systems.
### 6.2 Subsection 6.2: Interdisciplinary and Policy Opportunities
The literature on digital entrepreneurship and sustainable transitions consistently underscores the necessity of interdisciplinary research and policy strategies to address the complex challenges of modern innovation systems. Several studies emphasize the integration of digital entrepreneurship with fields such as environmental science, public policy, and social innovation to foster more holistic and impactful approaches to sustainable development [2,3]. For instance, the paper titled *Impacts of Digital Entrepreneurial Ecosystems on Sustainable Development: Insights from Latin America* advocates for a multidisciplinary framework that bridges digital innovation with environmental and social dimensions, suggesting that such integration can enhance the resilience and inclusivity of entrepreneurial ventures [3]. Similarly, *The Dawn of Digital Entrepreneurship: Joint SDG Fund Forges New Paths for Sustainability* highlights the importance of cross-sectoral collaboration, particularly between digital entrepreneurs, policymakers, and environmental experts, to ensure that technological advancements align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [2].  

However, while these studies recognize the value of interdisciplinary collaboration, their recommendations often lack concrete implementation strategies. For example, *Digital Entrepreneurship in Innovation Systems for Sustainable Transitions* acknowledges the potential for interdisciplinary research but notes that the discussion remains somewhat vague, with limited actionable steps for integrating digital entrepreneurship with other disciplines such as environmental science and public policy [1]. This gap in practical guidance suggests that future research should focus on developing structured methodologies for cross-disciplinary collaboration, including shared metrics, joint research agendas, and policy instruments that facilitate knowledge exchange between sectors.  

Comparing the approaches of these studies reveals a common emphasis on the need for policy frameworks that support digital entrepreneurship as a driver of sustainable transitions. While some papers propose theoretical models, others call for empirical studies to evaluate the long-term socio-economic and environmental impacts of digital initiatives, particularly in marginalized communities [2]. A comprehensive policy framework should therefore incorporate elements such as: (1) incentives for interdisciplinary research funding, (2) regulatory environments that encourage innovation while ensuring sustainability, and (3) mechanisms for stakeholder engagement across public, private, and civil society sectors.  

In conclusion, while the existing literature provides a strong foundation for understanding the interdisciplinary and policy dimensions of digital entrepreneurship, there is a clear need for more concrete and actionable strategies to translate these insights into effective policy and practice. By fostering cross-sectoral collaboration and embedding sustainability as a core principle in digital innovation, policymakers can harness the transformative potential of digital entrepreneurship to drive systemic change toward more sustainable transitions.
