      "content": "In recent years, biotechnological breakthroughs have led to identification of complex and unique biologic features associated with carcinogenesis. Tumor and cell-free DNA profiling, immune markers, and proteomic and RNA analyses are used to identify these characteristics for optimization of anticancer therapy in individual patients. Consequently, clinical trials have evolved, shifting from tumor type-centered to gene-directed, histology-agnostic, with innovative adaptive design tailored to biomarker profiling with the goal to improve treatment outcomes. A plethora of precision medicine trials have been conducted. The majority of these trials demonstrated that matched therapy is associated with superior outcomes compared to non-matched therapy across tumor types and in specific cancers. To improve the implementation of precision medicine, this approach should be used early in the course of the disease, and patients should have complete tumor profiling and access to effective matched therapy. To overcome the complexity of tumor biology, clinical trials with combinations of gene-targeted therapy with immune-targeted approaches (e.g., checkpoint blockade, personalized vaccines and/ or chimeric antigen receptor T-cells), hormonal therapy, chemotherapy and/or novel agents should be considered. These studies should target dynamic changes in tumor biologic abnormalities, eliminating minimal residual disease, and eradicating significant subclones that confer resistance to treatment. Mining and expansion of real-world data, facilitated by the use of advanced computer data processing capabilities, may contribute to validation of information to predict new applications for medicines. In this review, we summarize the clinical trials and discuss challenges and opportunities to accelerate the implementation of precision oncology.",

      "content": "The rapidly expanding body of knowledge about the roles of genomics and the immune system in cancer has enabled the development of therapies targeted to specific molecular alterations or other biologic characteristics, such as those implicated in immune suppression. However, genomics has also revealed a complicated reality about malignancies that requires a major shift in the therapy paradigm: away from tumor type-centered and toward gene-directed, histology-agnostic treatment, which is individualized for each patient on the basis of biomarker analysis. This paradigm shift is reflected by the emergence of precision medicine trials with innovative design [1–21]. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of advanced cancers has demonstrated that genomic alterations do not fall neatly into categories defined by the tumor organ of origin. Furthermore, metastatic tumors harbor tremendously complex and individually unique genomic and immune landscapes [22,23]. Therefore, in order to target malignancies with “precision,” treatment needs to be personalized.\n\nHistorically, phase II and III oncology clinical trials have measured outcomes histologically, but histological assessment cannot always capture the effects of gene-targeted agents or immunotherapy. Precision medicine approaches analyze patients’ circulating DNA (liquid biopsy), as well as immune markers and other biologic features, to assess efficacy and make treatment decisions. Genomic biomarkers have been the most successful to date, but other biomarkers, including protein assays and transcriptomics, are being developed and tested [13,24,25]. Several molecular alterations have been identified using sequencing and high-throughput technologies and have led to the approval of targeted agents by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [26,27]. Importantly, in recent years, the precision medicine paradigm has embraced immunotherapy and its interaction with genomics, as genomic characteristics, such as mismatch repair gene defects, are critical predictors of checkpoint blockade response [28–30].\n\nHerein, we review the rapid evolution of precision medicine in oncology and, in particular, the challenge and opportunity that genomic science has revealed vis-à-vis the need for ${ } ^ { 6 6 } \\mathrm { N } .$ -of-1” treatments. This treatment model does not conform to either canonical trial design or clinical practice, which seek to find commonalities between patients and treat them alike; instead, its goal is to provide optimized individualized treatment for each patient on the basis of biomarker analysis.",

      "content": "Survival improvement with gene- or immune-directed therapy was accelerated by several major discoveries. In particular, the introduction of imatinib mesylate (Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor) for patients with Philadelphia chromosome [t(9;22)]–positive chronic myelogenous leukemia producing the enzymatically aberrant Bcr-Abl [31,32] resulted in near-normal life expectancy for patients with this previously fatal leukemia.\n\nIn 2001, the human genome was sequenced [33]. Although this milestone represented an arduous and tremendously expensive endeavour, both the price and time required for sequencing have decreased precipitously, with technology advancing in a manner unparalleled in human history. A plethora of first- and second-generation precision medicine trials have since been conducted (Tables 1 and 2). They include, but are not limited to, the first pan-histology biomarkerdriven trial using mostly protein markers [1], the prospective molecular profiling of patients with advanced cancer in the phase I clinical trials setting (IMPACT trial) [2,4], the SHIVA randomized trial [5], trials assessing customized combinations [6,12], and trials including transcriptomics [13].",

      "content": "Traditionally, oncology trials are drug-centered, aiming to identify common attributes among patients (e.g., their tumor type or, more recently, a shared genomic abnormality) and fit them into a trial with a specific drug regimen. The large variability in genomic subgroups, microenvironment, baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and other covariates resulted in tumor-specific clinical studies encompassing a tremendously heterogeneous population in histology-specific, gene-agnostic trials. Phase III randomized trials were often critical for regulatory approval of a novel agent/regimen, especially since the antitumor activity of a new drug/regimen was frequently only marginally better than the comparator arm (usually, conventional therapy), perhaps because the regimen was effective in only a small subgroup of the diverse population represented by any specific histology.\n\nBasket, umbrella, platform, octopus, and master protocols\n\nMore recently, basket designs have emerged that target a common genetic defect [27]. The $7 5 \\%$ objective response rate noted across tumor types with larotrectinib, which targets NTRK fusions, best exemplifies the potential of the basket gene-directed, histology-agnostic model, though other single-gene targets have proven much less responsive [27]. Umbrella trials involve a single histology and different treatments based on the genomic alterations in patient subgroups [34]. Other trial designs include platform trials, which use a single analytic technique, such as NGS, to identify genomic or other biomarkers in tumors with multiple histologies; octopus trials (also referred to as “complete phase I trials”) that have multiple arms testing different combinations featuring a particular drug; and master protocols, which encompass trials with several histologic arms (previously, “broad phase II trials”) or multiple platform, basket, or umbrella trials or sub-trials [2–4,6] Randomization has also evolved, with the emergence of Bayesian adaptation, which allows dynamic modifications of randomization based on small numbers of patients and real-time outcomes.\n\nFrom drug-centered to patient-centered studies\n\nThe ultimate goal of precision medicine is an individualized, patient-centered (rather than drug-centered) trial based on the best available biomarkers. In “N-of-1” trials, each patient’s treatment is considered separately on the basis of molecular, immune, and other biologic characteristics. These trials involve customized drug combinations tailored to individual patients [12]. Determining efficacy in “Nof-1” trials requires assessing the “strategy” of matching patients to drugs, rather than treatments, which differ from patient to patient.",

Despite the current practical limitations, protein and transcript assays may provide essential information when integrated with genomics [13].

For example, in a prospective, multicenter, double-blind study, the number of CTCs in patients with untreated metastatic breast cancer correlated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) [44]. CTCs may also be a predictive biomarker for chemotherapy and immunotherapy [45,47]. However, the use of CTCs in clinical practice has not been fully established [48]. Finally, serial CTC analyses might enable real-time surveillance of the disease. A comparative study of five prospective randomized phase III trials in 6081 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer assessed the prognostic value of CTCs compared to prostate-specific antigen [49]. $\\mathrm { C T C } \\geq 0$ at baseline and at week 13 from treatment initiation was associated with OS.

The first solid tumor precision medicine trial to use transcriptomics in the clinic—WINTHER—compared RNA expression in tumors to that in adjacent normal tissue and demonstrated that transcriptomics increased the number of patients that could be matched to therapy [13]. Comparing tumor to normal tissue from the same patient may be necessary because of the large inter-patient variability in normal RNA expression. Other investigators have also used transcriptomics to select targeted treatments in patients with advanced solid tumors [57,58]. Challenges that prevent extensive use of transcriptomic biomarkers are degradation and fragmentation of RNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples, complexity of required bioinformatic analysis of profiling data and low reproducibility of the results.",

Selected patients with advanced disease have remarkable response, including durable complete remission (CR). Despite the significant benefit noted in patients with diverse tumor types treated with checkpoint inhibitors, approximately $8 0 \\%$ of patients across cancers do not experience beneficial effects. In the era of precision medicine, genomics, transcriptomics and other technologies are employed for the identification of biomarkers that predict benefit from immunotherapy. Interestingly, biomarkers predicting checkpoint inhibitor responsiveness are genomic: high tumor mutational burden (TMB) [28,59,61], mismatch gene repair defects resulting in high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) (and, thus, high TMB) [29,62], PBRM1 alterations [63,64], and PDL1 amplification [65]. Specifically, TMB has been shown to predict clinical benefit from checkpoint inhibitors [28]. In an analysis of 151 of 1638 patients who were treated with immunotherapeutic regimens and had TMB evaluation, high $_ { , \\geq 2 0 }$ mutations/mb) TBM was independently associated with significant improvement in PFS and OS compared to low to intermediate TMB [28]. Other studies have however questioned the use of TMB as a biomarker [66,67].\n\nGiven its strong association with response to immunotherapy, MSIH is an established biomarker for response to checkpoint inhibitors [68,69]. MSI-H tumors have high TMB, often accumulating $> ~ 1 0 0 0$ non-synonymous genomic mutations, leading to tumor-specific proteins, known as neoantigens. Due to high clinical benefit rates, immunotherapeutic regimens have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with advanced MSI-H colorectal cancer [70–72] or MSI-H tumors, irrespective of the organ of origin [73]. Finally, defects in DNA proofreading proteins polymerase δ (POLD1) and polymerase ε (POLE) lead to increased TMB and are associated with response to immunotherapy [59,74,75]. For instance, of 4 patients with non–small cell lung cancer with deleterious mutations in POLD1 and POLE (whole-exome sequencing, [WES]), 3 patients with the highest TMB responded to pembrolizumab [59]. Defects in other DNA repair systems might also be associated with response to immunotherapy. The predictive role of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is being evaluated in various tumors, including breast and ovarian cancer. Early phase clinical trials demonstrating that these patients may benefit from the addition of immunotherapy to poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, should be confirmed with additional studies [76,77].\n\nFurthermore, PBRM1 molecular alterations are evaluated as genomic biomarkers predicting checkpoint inhibitor responsiveness. Specifically, PBRM1 alterations were evaluated in a study of 35 patients with metastatic renal cell cancer treated with anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) regimens [63]. WES revealed loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the PBRM1 gene that predicted response to immunotherapy. Notably, the PBRM1 gene encodes for a protein of the chromatin remodeling complex, possibly interfering with hypoxia, and immune signaling pathways [63].\n\nAnother biomarker that predicts benefit from immunotherapy is PDL1 amplification [65]. In a retrospective analysis, this marker was identified in $0 . 7 \\%$ (843 of 118,187) patients of various tumor types and it did not always correlate with PD-L1 expression. Six of 9 $( 6 6 . 7 \\% )$ patients with PD-L1-amplified solid tumors had an objective response to checkpoint inhibitors, and their median PFS was 15.2 months [65]. PDL1 expression, assessed by immunohistochemistry on tumor cells or immune cells can be used as a response marker, albeit a suboptimal one [78]. Approximately $2 0 \\%$ of FDA approvals of immunotherapeutic agents are based on companion PD-L1 diagnostic testing [79].\n\nGenomic markers may also predict resistance—loss of JAK2 and beta 2 microglobulin mutations [80]—or hyper-progression (accelerated progression) after checkpoint blockade—MDM2 amplification and EGFR alterations [81]. WES of tumor tissue from 4 patients with advanced melanoma whose disease was resistant to anti–PD1 therapy, demonstrated LOF mutations in genes involved in interferon-receptor signaling and in antigen presentation (JAK1/2, β2-microglobulin) [80]. Importantly, PTEN loss is associated with resistance to immunotherapy in patients with melanoma, suggesting that targeting the PI3K/AKT/ mTOR pathway may overcome resistance to immunotherapy [82]. In our opinion, it is plausible that when PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway alterations or PTEN loss are the key drivers of the disease, immunotherapy may have limited, if any, antitumor activity. Similarly, STK11 mutations and $\\beta$ -catenin pathway alterations are reportedly associated with resistance to immunotherapy [83,84].\n\nIn summary, the available biomarkers are insufficient to adequately predict response to immunotherapy. Novel strategies may enhance our ability to identify biomarkers longitudinally, incorporating ctDNA analysis [85] or tumor tissue immune, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analysis.",

Autologous T-cells often identify these neo-epitopes as foreign bodies, which makes them ideal cancer vaccine targets. Every cancer has its own unique mutations, but a small number of neo-antigens are shared between cancers. Theoretically, technological advances will soon result in rapid mapping of mutations within a genome, rational selection of vaccine targets such as neo-epitopes, and on-demand production of vaccines tailored to a patient's individual tumor. Alternatively, off-the-shelf vaccines for tumors with shared epitopes might also be exploitable.\n\nSeveral personalized vaccines are currently being evaluated in clinical trials [103,104]. For example, investigators used computational prediction of neo-epitopes to design personalized RNA mutanome vaccines for patients with metastatic melanoma [103]. Two of the five patients treated had objective responses to the vaccine alone, while a third patient had a CR to treatment with the vaccine combined with PD1 blockade [103]. In another study of vaccine-induced polyfunctional $\\mathrm { C D 4 + }$ and $\\mathrm { C D 8 + }$ T-cells targeting unique neoantigens in patients with melanoma [104], four of six vaccinated patients had no recurrence at 25 months after vaccination [104].\n\nSipuleucel-T, the first FDA-approved therapeutic cancer vaccine, is produced via ex vivo activation of autologous peripheral-blood mononuclear cells by a recombinant fusion protein comprised of prostatic acid phosphatase and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor [105].

      "content": "Genomic studies have unveiled the reality of tumors—they are tremendously heterogeneic and complex, and optimized therapy often does not result from classical clinical research and practice models.\n\nPrecision medicine studies (Tables 1 and 2) demonstrate the major challenges in designing trials for this new paradigm. First, the rate of matching patients to drugs in these trials ranges from $5 \\%$ to $4 9 \\%$ and is mostly in the $1 5 \\%$ to $2 0 \\%$ range. Failure to match patients is attributed to (i) enrollment of individuals with end-stage disease, who deteriorate or die early; (ii) use of small gene panels that yield limited actionable alterations; (iii) delays in receiving and interpreting genomic results;\n\nand (iv) difficulty accessing targeted therapy drugs and/or limited drug availability. Some solutions provided by trials with higher matching rates, e.g., I-PREDICT 12 (matching rate, $4 9 \\%$ , include: (i) use of clinical trial navigators and medication acquisition specialists; (ii) application of a large NGS panel with $> ~ 2 0 0$ genes; (iii) creation of justin-time electronic molecular tumor boards immediately upon physician request; and (iv) exploitation of biomarkers to match patients to chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and immunotherapy (in addition to gene-targeted agents). The majority of these trials [2,3,12,24] have shown improvement in clinical outcomes when treatments are matched to drugs compared to when they are not. Importantly, malignancies have complicated molecular biology, and use of personalized combinations of drugs that address a higher percentage of the aberrations present in an individual cancer is associated with better outcomes than more limited matching [6,7,12,13].\n\nOther major hurdles encountered in the implementation of precision medicine include the following: (i) Potential differences in response to matched therapy depending on histology and/or genomic co-alterations. In contrast to molecular abnormalities that predict tumor agnostic response to treatment (e.g., NTRK fusions, MSI-H) [27,71,73], selected genomic biomarkers are predictive in specific tumor histologies [106,107]. (ii) The heterogeneity, complexity, and constant evolution of genomic landscapes. Due to significant heterogeneity between primary tumor and metastatic sites, molecular profiling of tumor tissue obtained from a single lesion may not always be representative of the systemic disease [108,109]. Additionally, under the pressure of targeted treatments, tumor molecular profile constantly evolves, with emerging resistant clones and new molecular alterations driving disease progression [110,111]. (iii) The need to screen large numbers of patients in order to find specific/rare genomic defects (for instance, NTRK fusions) [27,106,107]. (iv) Incomplete biologic/molecular profiles with which to select therapy; suboptimal technology and resources to understand completely the drivers of cancer in individual patients; (v) Considerable delays in the activation of clinical trials; (vi) differences in the metabolism and adverse effects of study drugs in various ethnic groups; (vii) lack of agreement between assays from different diagnostic companies/laboratories; and (viii) most importantly, lack of access to drugs for patients with limited resources as well as excessive eligibility criteria that rule out large swaths of patients with real-world co-morbidities. Approximately $3 \\mathrm { - } 5 \\%$ of patients with cancer are enrolled on clinical trials and accrual is limited by overly restrictive eligibility criteria and limited access to drugs [112]. ASCO, the Friends of Cancer Research, and the FDA recommended to broaden eligibility criteria to allow more patients to participate in clinical trials and gain benefit from novel investigational therapies [113]; and consequently participants will be representative of the actual patient population, increasing generalizability of the results. Patient enrollment could be enhanced by national and worldwide collaborations, as shown in multi-institutional trials [114,115]. Finally, the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI), has been developed to examine the challenges and propose solutions to improve trial recruitment [116].\n\nSeveral initiatives might help overcome the challenges introduced by our emerging understanding of cancer biology: (i) molecular profiling (tissue, blood) should be used at the time of diagnosis and during the course of the disease, the latter to monitor response and resistance; (ii) completion of molecular profiling should be expedited; and (iii) bioinformatic analysis should be optimized to include the key drivers of carcinogenesis.\n\nWith the current excitement about the promise of immunotherapy, a large proportion of patients are assigned to immunotherapy trials without undergoing molecular profiling or immune marker identification. Although a significant minority of these patients will experience a clinical benefit and prolonged survival, the majority will have disease progression and/or significant adverse events. Therefore, the incorporation of biomarkers into the selection of patients for immunotherapy needs to be optimized.\n\nFinally, the immense potential of real-world data needs to be addressed. Validation of database information can be performed by comparing outcomes of clinical trials that led to approval with those in the database; if outcomes are similar, real-world data can then be used to rapidly predict new applications for medicines.",

Tumor and cell-free DNA profiling using NGS, as well as proteomic and RNA analysis, and a better understanding of immune mechanisms are optimizing cancer treatment selection. A major challenge in the therapeutic management of patients with advanced metastatic cancer is the complexity of tumor biology. This complexity is attributed to highly variable patterns of genetic and epigenetic diversity and clonal architecture associated with spatial expansion, proliferative selfrenewal, migration, and invasion. The complexity is amplified by the dynamic, Darwinian evolutionary character of cancer cells, which undergo sequential searches for mechanisms to escape environmental constraints. Such cellular evolution involves the interplay of advantageous “driver” lesions, neutral or “passenger/hitchhiker” abnormalities, molecular changes in the tumor cells that increase the rate of other genomic anomalies, and modifications to the microenvironment and immune machinery that alter the fitness effects of other variables [117]. Strategies to address tumor complexity include targeting self-renewing cancer stem cells to overcome their plasticity and adaptability, impacting the microenvironment, and turning cancer into a chronic disease (using cytostatic drugs to suppress cell division and new mutations). The complicated nature of tumor biology is also the result of interactions between the tumor, host, and local ecosystem, including HLA type, genetic polymorphisms, microbiome, immune cell repertoire, and tumor microenvironment [118]. New strategies, some of which now have a proven track record, include gene-directed therapies and a host of immune-targeted approaches (e.g., checkpoint blockade, CAR Tcells, personalized vaccinomics) [118,119].\n\nAn overarching theme is that optimized therapy may require the utilization of combinations of drugs and/or strategies that attack the tumor from multiple angles. It is time to recognize the possibility that advanced computer implementation could generate real-world data that expand our understanding of cancer, rapidly identify new treatments, and create personalized drugs or immune therapies.",
