They are popularly known as indigenous bees or stingless bees due to the atrophy of the sting, which is no longer functional as a defensive weapon. At around 605 species the stingless bees are the most diverse lineage of the corbiculate bees, a clade that includes the most iconic groups of bees throughout the world: honey bees (Apini), bumble bees (Bombini), orchid bees (Euglossini), and, of course, the stingless bees (Meliponini). They are managed for their honey, second only to the honey bees, and are growingly used for agricultural purposes (e.g., Heard 1999; Slaa et al. 2006; Jha and Dick 2010). Meliponiculture, just like apiculture and the burgeoning area of bombiculture, is a growing industry in tropical countries and aside from pollination services, bee products such as honey, propolis, resin, and collected pollen are all key to human food, health, and food security. Stingless bees, like honey bees, are also key to the cultural and religious practices of many ancient and current indigenous peoples, further emphasizing how the bees are key to the everyday lives of those living in the tropics.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 1.

Naturally, these subjects could occupy entire books in their own right and it is therefore impossible for any of these topics to be afforded sufficient justice or depth as to satisfy most readers. Therefore, the present effort merely attempts to whet the appetite of the mind and direct the reader to where more thorough information may be sought. In this regard, we would be remiss if we did not mention the recent and excellent tome by Christoph Grüter that covers the biology, evolution, and ecology of Meliponini in greater depth than we could ever hope (Grüter 2020). Beyond this book, excellent reviews are by Michener (2007a, 2013), Melo (2021), and Quezada-Euán (2018), and although now somewhat dated the review of meliponine nest architecture by Wille and Michener (1973), the review of stingless bee sociobiology by Michener (1974), and those on their biology and evolution by Schwarz (1948), Wille (1979, 1983), and Roubik (2023) all remain indispensable resources.",

      "content": "Stingless bees are a long-recognized lineage of apine in the superfamily Apoidea, and belong to the clade of corbiculate tribes. The corbiculate bees are so named for the possession of a metatibial corbicula in females of non-parasitic forms (Fig. 2). In common parlance the corbicula is the proverbial “pollen basket”, used for the transport of pollen wetted by nectar and saliva. The structure consists of a broadened, depressed, smooth, largely glabrous area on the apical prolateral surface of the metatibia, typically fringed by long setae that help to create and define a negative space in which the resources are held. Aside from pollen, the corbicula can be used to transport other materials, such as resins or mud.\n\nThe Meliponini are universally recognized as a monophyletic group, supported by a large number of specializations relative to other corbiculate bees. Some of the key traits distinguishing Meliponini include: the presence of a penicillum, lack an auricle (“pollen press”) proximally on the metabasitarsus, the simple pretarsal claws, alar venation reduction, and, of course, the general reduction of sclerites associated with the sting complex. Other features that in combination help to define Meliponini but are found in other combinations among the remaining corbiculate tribes are the general reduction of outer grooves on the mandibles, the loss of the metatibial spurs, the presence of arolia, the absence of a supra-alar carina, and the presence of a jugal lobe on the hind wing (Michener 1990, 2007a; Engel et al. 2021a, 2021b; Engel and Rasmussen 2021). Systematic coverages of meliponine immature stages have been provided by Rozen (2021), Rozen et al. (2019a, 2019b, 2021), and Rozen and Smith (2019).\n\nNaturally, one of the hallmark traits of stingless bees is the largely vestigial sting apparatus. The various structures associated with the sting complex are present in Meliponini, but they are reduced and generally nonfunctional, although those of the African Meliponula Cockerell are comparatively well developed along with an enlarged poison gland (Kerr and Lello 1962), suggesting the potential for some minor functionality as a defensive apparatus. The reduction of the sting perhaps reflects a history in which the lineage underwent significant body size diminution, a “miniaturization bottleneck”, with a sting no longer serving as an effective deterrent for vertebrate predators (Wille 1979). This has been lent some added credence by the early diverging position of Trigonisca\n\n[Image]\nFigure 2.

While the sting was rendered inert, the nests of stingless bees gained considerably in their defensive qualities, picking up where the potency of a sting was removed. Nonetheless, while vestigial sting sclerites are distinctive for meliponines and inaccessible and tough nest architectures prevent many predators from interfering, stingless bees are not defenseless (Roubik 2023).\n\nThe closest relatives of Meliponini are the species of the extinct tribe Melikertini (Engel 1998, 2001a, 2001b; Schultz et al. 2001), a group of corbiculate bees that disappeared around the time of the Eocene-Oligocene mass extinction event, approximately 35 million years ago (Engel 2001a, 2001b; Engel and Davis 2021). Melikertines were globally distributed and seemingly tropical, subtropical, and paratropical eusocial bees, but unlike Meliponini possessed the complete complement of wing venation, had a well-developed and insertable sting, possessed a functional pollen press, and had metatibial spurs, albeit quite reduced relative to those of other bees (Engel and Davis 2021). Like Meliponini, melikertines seem to have commonly collected resin, presumably to be used similarly in nest construction (Engel and Davis 2021). Melikertines and meliponines coexisted for a considerable period of history before the disappearance of the former at the end of the Eocene.\n\nThere has been considerable interest in the phylogeny of stingless bees, not only in terms of their classification but also for understanding their biogeography, behavior, physiology, and nest architecture, among other phenomena. An understanding of relationships among the lineages of Meliponini has shifted considerably over the years. Earlier authors presented a wide number of hypotheses, typically with small differences but sometimes wholly incompatible, all based on different interpretations or analyses of morphological and/or biological data (e.g., Wille 1983), although some also incorporated or were based upon small swaths of DNA sequences (e.g., Costa et al. 2003). More recently, however, a detailed and comprehensive exploration of molecular data has helped to provide some greater clarity, and a pattern of overall relationships that is robust and simultaneously consistent with several morphological, behavioral, and biogeographic patterns (Rasmussen and Cameron 2010). These relationships, in turn, have helped to refine elements of the classification as well as formulate new hypotheses regarding meliponine evolution and are summarized in Figs 3, 4.",

It was not until the works of Heinrich Friese (1860–1948) and Theodore D.A. Cockerell (1866–1948) that serious alterations to the classification were initiated, although most species were still placed in a massive, ill-circumscribed Trigona. These two authors were then followed by the extensive and detailed studies of Herbert F. Schwarz (1883–1960) and Jesus S. Moure (1912–2010), who effectively provided new interpretations for natural groupings of stingless bees, with the latter establishing the foundations for our current system of Meliponini. The growing biological data available for many species also served as a new source of character information for establishing groupings of these bees (e.g., Schwarz 1948). Subsequent to Moure, most changes to the supraspecific classification consisted of the addition of new taxa, largely through the efforts of João M.F. Camargo (1941–2009) and his collaborators in the New World and Shôichi F. Sakagami (1927–1996) in the Old World (e.g., Sakagami 1975, 1978, 1982). Contra these systems, Charles D.

Engel in Engel et al. 2021a), including keys to the genera and subgenera by region and summaries of distribution and identification tools for each genus, along with a checklist of currently recognized species. The three keys presented here allow for the identification of all currently recognized genera and subgenera of Meliponini. The keys are adapted from recent works that relate to the new organization of the tribe (Rasmussen et al. 2017; Engel 2019; Engel et al. 2021a) and are organized by geographic region, in the same manner as was done by Michener (2007a), although with a considerably different arrangement of genera. Naturally, there will always be disagreement over the recognition of particular groups and at what rank they should be classified, and different systematists will advocate for slightly different systems depending on their concepts of the groups. Even the authors of this chapter do not agree on all points of the current classification (e.g., whether Leurotrigona Moure should be removed from Trigonisca as its own genus, whether Dolichotrigona Moure should be recognized as a valid subgenus independent of Trigonisca s.str., whether Mourella Schwarz should be accorded generic rank, etc.). These finer points are all worthy of merit and undoubtedly will be revised in time. For now, we have followed the system as recently outlined in Engel et al. (2021a), with the exception of elevating Mourella as a genus and some additions from the last year (e.g., subgenera of Geotrigona Moure, Scaptotrigona Moure, and Scaura Schwarz) and herein (one new genus). Although we allude to some disparities and future subjects to be resolved, we do not intend here to emphasize justification or alternative interpretations, which are more fully explained in some of the recent publications cited herein. Regardless, the revised classification is based on comprehensive phylogenetic hypotheses for the tribe (Rasmussen and Cameron 2010).\n\nMorphological terminology for the keys generally follows that used in major works on bees (e.g., Engel 2001a; Michener 2007a), although the terms of orientation for the legs follow that outlined by Engel et al. (2021a) and wing venation terms are from Rasmussen et al. (2017). Following the keys are brief summaries for each genus, along with a list of those currently recognized species in each taxon (subspecies and synonyms are not listed; species lists are current as of 29 June 2023).",

Species of Lestrimelitta Friese are cleptobiotic (Roubik 1980; Bego et al. 1991), maintaining their nests by “stealing” the resources of other Meliponini and introduced Apis, often causing losses to stingless beekeepers. Lestrimelitta primarily rob brood provisions from their hosts, most frequently species of Nannotrigona, Scaptotrigona, Plebeia, and Melipona (Sakagami et al. 1993). During an attack on the host bees’ nests, most Lestrimelitta release a pheromone reminiscent of lemon (citral), which confuses the defense communication between workers and guards of the host (Breed et al. 2004.).

The preoccipital ridge is carinate to minutely lamellate and with three distinctive pits dorsally, and often with an interruption laterally. The metatibiae are also quite characteristic, subtriangular in shape and lacking plumose setae on the retromarginal edge, but bordered by an abundance of rather thick, curved bristles. Like Nannotrigona Cockerell, the mesoscutellum has a characteristic longitudinal depression or groove extending from anterior margin medially, but the integument is not as coarsely punctured. While the genus is easy to distinguish, the species are quite complex with considerable variation and the identification of the species can be difficult. The genus was recently organized into a series of subgenera, including a key to these subgeneric lineages (Engel 2022d). A key to species of the subgenus Sakagamilla is presented in Engel (2022b); to those of Eoscaptotrigona Engel, Gymnotrigona Engel, and Baryorygma Engel in Engel (2022d); to the species of Astegotrigona Engel by Engel (2022e). A partial key to one group of Scaptotrigona s.str. has been published (Engel 2022c) and other new species presented by Engel (2022f), but further work remains to be completed on the Central American fauna (in prep.) as well as Scaptotrigona s.str. in South America. The genus occurs from central Mexico to northern Argentina and is frequently found in meliponiaries. The nest entrance is a long trumpet or tube, sometimes greatly expanded, and usually with small uniformly spaced holes and much flexibility. Species nest almost solely in living trees (except when they live in buildings) and always build regular horizontal combs. A notable exception is S. subobscuripennis (Schwarz), of Costa Rica and western Panama, which nests in cavities in the ground, and apparently never uses tree cavities. The honey has good flavor and is appreciated by many, and propolis from Scaptotrigona is widely used for medicinal purposes.

The genus is one of the more widespread groups of New World stingless bees, as well as a relatively commonly encountered group of meliponines. The nesting biology was explored for Trigonisca mepecheu Engel & Gonzalez by Engel et al. (2019). A key to the species of Celetrigona Moure is presented by Camargo and Pedro (2009). The subgenera Leurotrigona and Exochotrigona Engel apparently form a grade at the base of Trigonisca s.l. and are classified by some authors as a separate genus. They can be easily distinguished from the other Neotropical minute bees by the smooth, polished, and shiny integument, the absence of a preoccipital carina, and the absence of yellow markings. Many new species have been encountered and are currently being described for the western Amazon (Roubik 2018). A key to the species was provided by Pedro and Camargo (2009: all species at that time classified in Leurotrigona). A revision of Trigonisca s.str. is needed, but a beginning was made by Albuquerque and Camargo (2007).

The genus is also commonly encountered in East African copal and modern resins (Solórzano-Kraemer et al. 2022). Nest may be built in dry logs, rock or wall crevices, or even in pre-existing cavities of living trees, often with a protruding oval entrance tube.

It differs quite notably from Dactylurina and is therefore here removed to a new genus.

The new genus-group name is a combination of the Ancient Greek alpha privative $a - \\mathrm { ~ / ~ } \\check { a } ^ { - } ,$ , indicating negation, and Dactylurina Cockerell [itself a combination of the Latin adjective dactylus, meaning, “finger-like” (from Ancient Greek dáktulos / δᾰ́κτῠλος, meaning, “finger”), and the noun ūrīna, meaning, “urine” but also referring more generally to “genitals” or even metaphorically to the “tail end” through its Ancient Greek origins from the word ourā́ / οὐρᾱ́, meaning, “tail”], the genus to which the species was originally placed.

      "content": "Stingless bees are, of course, eusocial (Michener 1974), and of the anchored grade (sensu Engel 2023). They live in perennial colonies, which range considerably in size and complexity, but always have males and females, the latter organized into distinct worker and queen castes, and the usual division of labor, age polyethism, and generation overlaps that come from these distinctions (Fig. 6). In addition, polyethism within the worker caste, most often based on age, is sometimes also based on subtle morphometric differences to produce, in some species, a functional soldier-like caste (Grüter et al. 2017). Workers dominate the population of a colony and undertake all of the work to maintain the nest and support the queen and males. Most notably they perform all of the foraging activities for food and nest materials, and throughout the active period of the day a nearly constant flow of foraging workers can be seen coming and going. While for most stingless bees this consists of collecting pollen, nectar, resin, and mud, there are exceptions, with some species harvesting honeydew and wax from scale insects (Coccidae), collecting from fungi, and others scavenging the decomposing carcasses of vertebrates (Camargo and Pedro 2002b; Oliveira and Morato 2000; Roubik 1982, 2021). Scavenging the carcasses of small vertebrates occurs, but larger vertebrates are used by obligate necrophages, who also utilize invertebrates like annelids, spiders and Orthoptera. Several species of Meliponini and other bees visit carcasses to collect salts, lipids, and water (Oliveira et al. 2013, Ribeiro et al. 2022), but only obligate necrophages consume animal protein and make honey from dead meat, and microbes make the glucose and amino acids (Roubik 2023). In Asia, minute species, where known, are lachryphagous, sucking the tears from eyes of various birds and mammals (Bänziger 2018). In the Neotropical region lachryphagous species of Trigonisca s.l. (typically the subgenera Leurotrigona, Exochotrigona, and some Trigonisca s.str.), are known as “lambe-olhos”, “lameojos”, or “chupaojos” (lick eye) (Camargo and Pedro 2005; pers. obs.), and some species when crushed leave a caustic secretion that can cause eye irritation (Carvalho et al. 1949; Villas-Bôas and Villas-Bôas 1994). Foraging for pollen may even be decoupled from visiting flowers in Scaura, where the bees use enlarged metabasitarsi to “mop” pollen that has fallen from flowers onto bordering leaves or other surfaces (Michener et al. 1978). A similar behavior was observed for Trigonisca (Trigonisca) tavaresi Camargo & Pedro whereby the bees collected pollen from the surface of flower petals that had been dropped by larger bees (Oliveira et al. 2013). At an even greater extreme, species of Lestrimelitta and Liotrigona (Cleptotrigona) are robbers that collect their materials from the nests of other meliponines, either by mass invasion, as in the former or by stealthy, spy-like gathering by isolated workers in the latter (Portugal-Araújo 1958; Sakagami et al. 1993). Trichotrigona apparently also does not store food and is a cleptobiotic social bee associated with Frieseomelitta (Pedro and Cordeiro 2015).\n\nFrom the moment of eclosion to the adult, workers begin their life-long labors, with lifespans ranging from 30–40 days (Sakagami 1982). Initially they are teneral, appearing nearly white and with comparatively soft cuticle (called callows), but gradually the tanning and melanization of sclerites is completed. For the first phase of their lives, workers remain within the colony to care for the developing young, building brood combs and storage pots, process food resources, engage in hygienic behaviors, cleaning and repairing the nest, tending the queen, thermal regulation for the nest, and, when necessary, defense from invaders, among many other roles (Grüter, 2020). Workers within the colony may also lay eggs, which are either trophic eggs used to feed the queen or develop into males given that workers are unmated and their eggs are therefore unfertilized (Koedam et al. 1996). As they age, workers take on the more dangerous roles external to the nest, primarily foraging. Males will also forage for nutrients as they do not receive food within the nest, nor do they live within the nest. Foraging workers locate, harvest, and transport the many supplies needed to keep colonial life going (van Veen and Sommeijer 2000; Sakagami 1982). Additionally, during colony division such foragers will locate a new suitable nest site and begin construction of the new nest, with the materials coming from nature or even derived from the original nest. Eventually, that subset of workers that established the new nest will be followed by an unmated queen that will then copulate with males and assume the reproductive role for the new colony. This is, of course, in stark contrast to honey bees (Apini) in which it is the old queen that departs to establish the new colony (Michener 2007a). Gradually, interaction and exchange between the original and new colonies cease, which results in two distinct and functional societies.\n\nMost colonies have a single physogastric queen (Fig. 6A), although there are uncommon cases of polygynous colonies occurring naturally (e.g., Velthuis et al. 2001). Queens are produced in larger brood cells, queen cells (Fig. 6), which are built on the periphery of combs and typically formed by combining two normal brood cells (Grüter 2020). In Melipona, however, the brood cells are of a uniform size. In Meliponini queens are determined by diet and a genetic-feeding mechanism (Kerr 1948), but in Melipona and some species that build brood cells in clusters virtually any emerging female is capable of becoming a potential queen dependent on what she is fed by the earlier generation of workers. Unmated queens can be found in colonies at nearly any time of year and may even be imprisoned by the workers in entrapment cells composed of cerumen or even in empty storage pots in the case of Melipona (Imperatriz-Fonseca and Zucchi 1995). The small population of unmated queens provides the colony a source of replacement queens should the current queen die unexpectedly. In meliponiaries there is in Melipona the phenomenon of parasitic virgin queens, which enter nests lacking queens, but might or might not do so in native forest environments (Roubik 2023). When colonies are about to divide, the production of unmated queens will increase. If too may unmated queens are present, then workers may expel them from the nest, kill them outright, or imprison them. Either way, the result is that such expelled queens will die in the absence of a nest and support from a retinue of workers. Often a queen will store considerable nutrients within her body, resulting in the expansion of her metasoma. Nonetheless, once mated the queen’s metasoma will expand dramatically owing to the development of her ovaries and an increase in the number of ovarioles. Many mated queens will become so physogastric as to be unable to fly.\n\nMales are usually the least common individuals within a nest. Males usually appear when the number of royal cells increases and there is a preponderance of food stores within the nest. The emerging males do little other than hang about the periphery of the nest or cluster around unmated queens, waiting for them to depart on their nuptial flight at which point they have a chance of mating.

      "content": "The nests of stingless bees are more intricate than any other bees and represent a cornucopia of interconnected layers and structures, most of which are composed of cerumen (Wille and Michener 1973) (Figs 5–7). Cerumen is a substance produced by the bees through the combination of wax, secreted from the bees’ tergal glands, with resin or other plant substances (plant resins stored by the bees are called propolis), or even enzymatic secretions (that is, some may add significant saliva) (Roubik 2023). Depending on the part of the nest, the cerumen may be further mixed with or bolstered by mud, feces, small pebbles, and/or sand. Mud and clay mixed with propolis by the bees is frequently referred to as geopropolis. Cerumens vary considerably, not only among bees, but for different parts of the nest and may therefore range from pliable to friable to exceedingly tough (Roubik 2023). Perhaps not surprisingly, tougher cerumen is often found toward the exterior, while more flexible materials, if present, are internal to the nest. The cerumen also embodies considerably antimicrobial properties, the result of both the bee secretions incorporated into the admixture or bestowed by the different plant resins (Shanahan and Spivak 2021; Roubik 2023). Thus, the chemical properties of the cerumen itself represents a form of colony defense from the most unseen of pathogenic invaders. An extensive line of research awaits comparative studies of the microbiomes of the unharvested resins, the unadulterated wax and bee secretions, the bees’ intestines, and the resulting cerumen used in different parts of the nest.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 5.

All photographs C. Rasmussen except F R. Ayala and G and H M.S. Engel.\n\nNests vary widely but can be generally summarized as follows (Fig. 5): At the center is a brood chamber composed of brood cells. Individual brood cells are oriented horizontally (except vertically in Dactylurina and Scaura (Scaura) longula; Darchen and Pain 1966; Nogueira-Neto 1992), house a single developing bee, and open upward when the adult emerges (Fig. 6F). Mass provisions are provided before the queen lays an egg within the brood cell, which is thereafter sealed and left undisturbed until the new adult chews her way out. These cells are not reused and are broken down once development is completed. The brood cells are arranged in characteristic patterns, many times in a spiral pattern to form a horizontal comb (Fig. 6B, E), although in some species the cells are more irregularly placed in clusters, sometimes quite loosely (Fig. 6C, D). Brood clusters are most often found in those species of smaller sizes that can build nests within irregular cavities, interconnected cavities, or tight crevices that otherwise do not lend themselves to the more rigid spatial parameters required by stacks of horizontal combs. This brood chamber is wrapped by an involucrum (Fig. 5), often made of several tightly adjoined layers and thus, laminate (Roubik 2006). The involucrum maintains a stable temperature for the brood chamber and is important for thermoregulation in many species (Roubik 2006). Outside of the brood chamber, and outside of the involucrum when present, is the storage area (Fig. 5). Within this space the bees construct pots in clusters or in layers, but not distinct combs (Fig. 6C, G). These pots are built with cerumen and used to store pollen and honey. Surrounding the storage space, and thus enveloping the entirety of the nest, are layers of batumen (Fig. 5). The batumen layers, which are wall-like layers of particularly thick and cured resin. The outer layer of batumen can nicely fit against and within irregular surfaces or spaces. When the batumen is used to close off the nest from the remainder of a larger cavity, the layers are thick and tough, concrete-like (Fig. 5), and referred to as geopropolis. Similar tough layers of batumen are used to form the outer walls of exposed nests. A tube is built that leads from the storage space through the layers of batumen to the exterior of the nest. Entrance tubes can often be unique, even diagnostic for given genera, subgenera, or species, and range from simple, thin tubes with a singular opening to elaborate branched or multi-opening structures (Fig. 7).\n\nNest sites are a limiting factor for most bees and the same seems to be true for stingless bees. Indeed, this may have also been a contributing factor leading to the miniaturization bottleneck for Meliponini. Many species build nests within pre-existing cavities in tree trunks or branches, with a preference for spaces that have narrowed openings with the surrounding environment, and which can be easily closed by the bees during nest construction (Wille and Michener 1973; Roubik 2006). The tree hollows used are often the result of some decay, which perhaps has also fueled the use of antimicrobially active cerumen for the bee colonies. Other forms of cavities may also be used, such as hollows in the ground, spaces within cliff faces, and in a wide range of human-produced spaces: in the walls or roofs of homes, in pipes, in electrical boxes, or even within furniture. Other stingless bees build their nests inside the exposed aerial nests of ants or termites, building an entrance tube on the exterior of the host nest and then gradually excavating into the side of the host and constantly enclosing the growing space so as to prevent their “hosts” from entering the newly founded bee nest (Camargo 1984). At the other end of the spectrum, some species of Partamona will construct their own “cavities” by building out from a starting point, usually against a tree or cliff, while some species of Trigona do similarly by wrapping batumen walls around a tree branch (semi-exposed nests) (Camargo and Pedro 2003; Rasmussen and Camargo 2008). Only two stingless bees, of all Apoidea, are known to nest in a single kind of plant, or have a host melittophyte. They are western Amazonian Plebeia that live in the upper branches of large Cecropia (Roubik 2021). A diversity of nests, both natural and managed, are illustrated in Figs 8, 9.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 7.

All photographs C. Rasmussen except A and B M.S. Engel.\n\nAlthough stingless bees have an atrophied (vestigial) sting and lack an ability to sting it does not make them defenseless. They exhibit different mechanisms for protecting their nests, ranging from camouflaging the nest entrance, nest construction in places difficult to access, to an active defensive behavior, sometimes quite elaborate. They can tangle themselves in hair and fur, pinching the skin of the aggressor or intruder with their jaws, which can even cause some injuries, enter the nostrils, and ears of intruders, as well as depositing plant resins or caustic substances on the intruder, this last specialized behavior observed with the mandibular glands of bees in the genus Oxytrigona (it also has to be wondered if Papuatrigona has similarly caustic mandibular secretions: MSE, pers. obs.). If grabbed, many stingless bees will bend the metasoma around to their attacker, mimicking the behavior of stinging, perhaps relying on a Batesian-like mimicry with stinging bees and wasps. Lastly, some species, such as Frieseomelitta silvestrii (Friese), the bees will play dead (thanatosis) when they encounter a large enemy (Ihering 1912; Michener 1974).\n\n[Image]\nFigure 9.
