# INTRODUCTION

Bioluminescence imaging (BLI） with luciferase reporters is a highly valuable technique for tracking genetically labeled cell populations and monitoring molecular processes in vivo.In its simplest form, BLI detects the presence of labeled cels at a particular location over time，which can reveal changes in cellular proliferation or survival throughout development, disease,or therapy.1 In a more specific scheme,the expression of luciferase reporters can be made responsive to biochemical signals,allowing BLI to track these signals over time.² A major advantage of BLI is that it can be performed longitudinally and noninvasively. Other benefts of BLI include the lack of an intrinsic bioluminescence signal in animals allowing for high sensitivity and specificity，its relative simplicity and affordability,and the ability to perform simultaneous whole-body imaging of model animals such as mice.3-5

To perform BLI, cells are genetically engineered to express a luciferase enzyme that reacts with an exogenously delivered substrate to produce light, which is then detected by a camera6 (Figure lA).The most thoroughly studied luciferases are those isolated from insects,with the Photinus pyralis firefly luciferase (FLuc）being the most widely used. In insect luciferases, oxidation of the substrate D-luciferin in the presence of oxygen, ATP,and $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ produces yellow light with an emission peak at $5 7 8 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } C .$ Other insect luciferases that are used for BLI include those from the firefly Luciola italica and the click beetle Pyrophorus plagiophthalamus.A larger number of known luciferases，however，originate from marine organisms and produce blue light (emission peak $4 5 0 { - } 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ）from the oxidation of coelenterazine (CTZ） in the absence of cofactors other than oxygen. Commonly used CTZ-dependent systems include Renilla (RLuc)，Gaussia (GLuc)，and NanoLuc luciferases.9

BLI detection favors superficially located cells due to absorption and scattering of light by tissue.In mammalian tissues,hemoglobin impairs transmission of wavelengths below $6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { \ n m } }$ ，which partially or completely overlaps with the emission spectra of most natural luciferases discovered to dateTherefore,toimprove thedetectionofsparsecell populations at greater tissue depths, it would be advantageous to develop luciferases with red-shifted emission spectra (Figure 1B).Alternatively, luciferases with higher specific activity or higher levels of expression (through more efficient translation or slower degradation） would improve limits of detection for small numbers of cels but alone would not reduce depthdependent attenuation.Additionally,many current substrates possess uneven biodistribution within mice.For example, intravenously injected $^ { 1 4 } \mathrm { C - D }$ -luciferin showed early high uptake in the kidney and liver, late predominant uptake in the bladder，and limited access to the brain.11 Substrate solubility and stability are also limiting factors of CTZ and its analogs. 12

Due to these limitations，significant efforts have been invested in the development of improved BLI luciferase/ luciferin pairs for improved monitoring of cellular processes. Here，we summarize recent advances in luciferase systems aimed to improve in vivo sensitivity in mammalian model systems,and we highlight novel biological applications of the expanding BLI toolbox.

# BLI SYSTEMS ENGINEERING

With the goal of improving detection sensitivity from deep locations in mammalian subjects,multiple efforts have attempted to mutate luciferases to increase catalytic activity or to red-shift emission (Table 1). One of the earliest examples of wavelength shifting comes from the $\mathrm { S } 2 8 4 \mathrm { T }$ mutant of FLuc, PpeRS,discovered by random mutagenesis to create a ${ \sim } 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ red-shift in the emission peak.13 However, the brightness of PpeRS in vivo is not significantly increased, suggesting the mutation merely eliminates the production of green photons rather than increasing the output of red photons.A similar observation of selective loss of green emission without an increase in red emission was made with a Y257A mutation in Luciola firefly luciferase,which also produced a ${ \sim } 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ redshift.14 Efforts on RLuc engineering have been relatively more successful in emission shifting.The RLuc8 variant, consisting of eight mutations, displays a 4-fold increase in brightness, while $\mathrm { R L u c } 8 . 6 - 5 3 5$ exhibits a $5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ peak wavelength shift to $5 3 5 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ and 2.6-fold brighter emission than RLuc8 at a tissue depth of $1 { - } 2 ~ \mathrm { \ m m }$ .16 This suggests that the increased brightness of $\mathrm { R L u c } 8 . 6 - 5 3 5$ is indeed due to an increased production of red photons,as desired.However, the emission spectrum of $\mathrm { R L u c } 8 . 6 - 5 3 5$ lies nearly completely below 600 nm，reducing the sensitivity of imaging by $\mathrm { R L u c } 8 . 6 - 5 3 5$ to lower than that of FLuc.

Taken together, these early studies suggest that mutagenesis of insect and marine luciferases alone may not be sufficient to dramatically improve in vivo performance of these BLI systems. Thus，additional strategies， such as engineering of luciferase substrates with improved emission characteristics or dramatically red-shifting emission using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), may be necessary.

Synthetic Substrate Analogs. An orthogonal approach to modifying bioluminescence properties，and one that can overcome wavelength limitations inherent to D-luciferin or coelenterazine,is to chemically alter the substrate (Figure 2). Substrate engineering is often then accompanied by enzyme engineering to ensure maximal optimization of the system.For the firefly luciferase system，it has been discovered that emission color is primarily determined by the charge distribution on the oxyluciferin product.17 Various methods to redistribute the electronic charge，such as replacing substituent groups or extending conjugation on the luciferin, have led to the synthesis of novel luciferin analogs capable of red-shifting the emission light.18,19 Efforts have also focused on modifying luciferins to enhance the circulation time，water solubility,and membrane permeability of luciferins for deep tissue imaging.20,21

A major group of D-luciferin analogs is based on aminoluciferins. The first aminoluciferin analog was developed in 1966 by replacing the ${ { \boldsymbol { 6 } } ^ { \prime } }$ -hydroxyl group of D-luciferin with an amino group,resulting in a peak emission shift to $5 9 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ and a ${ \sim } 1 0$ fold increased affinity for FLuc.2² Research focused on optimizing analogs for in vivo imaging led to the development of the cyclic alkylaminoluciferin CycLuc1.When injected at a dose 2O-fold lower than D-luciferin, CycLucl can still lead to brighter signal and achieve sensitive brain imaging in FLucexpresing mice.2324Whilewild-typeFLucispromiscuous Adams et al. later engineered some FLuc mutants that exhibit 40-50-fold selectivity for aminoluciferins (including CycLuc1) over D-luciferin in mouse brains.25 Notably, when paired with aminoluciferins,the engineered FLuc variants did not exhibit increased brightness，indicating the primary cause of the selectivity is likelya loss of utilization of D-luciferin rather than increased utilization of the synthetic aminoluciferins.Recently, Wu et al.investigated a series of novel N-cycloalkylaminoluciferins called cyaLucs and reported one analog, cybLuc,with improved sensitivity in vivo.At maximum doses ( $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ for D-luciferin and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ for CybLuc), CybLuc provided 7-fold brighter bioluminescence in the mouse brain, which suggests that cybLuc can efficiently traverse the blood-brain barrier and has higher accessibility to deep brain tissues.In addition, the cybLuc signal plateaued for more than $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ ,whereas the D-luciferin signal began to drop after only $5 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ ， suggesting cybLuc can be used in applications requiring long-time observation in vivo.

Recent efforts have succeeded in further shifting bioluminescence into the near-infrared (NIR) region. Kuchimaru et al.synthesized a novel luciferin analog，AkaLuminehydrochloride (AkaLumine-HCl),by replacing the benzothiazole structure in D-luciferin with a dimethylaniline moiety and extending the $\pi$ -conjugated system.26 When paired with native FLuc,AkaLumine-HCl emits NIR light peakingat $6 7 7 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ and possesses a more favorable biodistribution.Iwano et al. further refined this system by engineering FLuc through successive rounds of mutagenesis to optimize pairing with AkaLumineHCl,and their work yielded the novel luciferase Akaluc.27 Imaging with Akaluc/AkaLumine-HCl exhibited up to 1000 times brighter emissions in vivo compared to FLuc/D-luciferin and was capable of single-cell detection in deep lung tissues in mice.Additionally，improved BLI in the brain owing to effcient blood-brain-barrier penetration of AkaLumine-HCl enabled video-rate imaging of striatal neurons in marmosets,a significant milestone in in vivo BLI.Later, the superiority of Akaluc over FLuc was recaptured in the mouse brain. 28

However, it was questioned by another study when applied in the imaging fate of cell therapy outside the brain,although in this research D-luciferin was administered at a dose 6-fold higher than common usage.29 Some potential drawbacks of AkaLumine-HCl include the background hepatic signal30,31 and noticeabletoxicitytoskinandheart931likelydue tothe acidity in AkaLumine-HCl solution.A structurally similar luciferin analog, seMpai, does not produce a detectable hepatic signal when paired with Akaluc in vivo and may be more suitable for sensitive imaging of the liver,although at the cost of lower brightness compared to AkaLumine-HCl.31

In 2020, Ikeda et al. further expanded the palette of NIRemitting substrates with the development of NIR luciferins (NIRLucs).32 Using the structure of AkaLumine asa framework, they synthesized a series of novel luciferins via a ring fusion strategy and reached peak wavelengths up to 690 nm when paired with FLuc. One candidate, NIRLuc2, was tested in vivo. Although NIRLuc2 was dimmer than AkaLumine in vitro,it was comparable to AkaLumine in a subcutaneous tumor model which might be due to its improved pharmacokinetics properties (although the dose was questionably maintained at $5 ~ \mathrm { \ m M }$ and intravenous injection was adopted instead of intraperitoneal).More sustained bioluminescence was also achieved as a result of longer half-life in blood and higher affinity to FLuc.

Other NIR luciferins include the beetle luciferin analog infraluciferinwithassionakat $7 0 8 \ \mathrm { n m }$ 33 Moreover, infraluciferin produces distinct bioluminescent colors with various luciferase mutants and therefore may be useful for imaging multiple cell populations or biochemical processes within the same animal (see the Multicomponent BLI section). Similarly, the naphthyl-based luciferin $\mathrm { N H } _ { 2 } { \mathrm { - N p L H } } 2$ can be paired with the mutant click beetle red luciferase (CBR2） to produce NIR emission $\left( 7 3 0 \mathrm { n m } \right)$ ,with potential applications in multicomponent imaging.34

Investigation into novel CTZ analogs that enhance bioluminescence in animals has also been a wide field of study. However, this has been much more challenging due to the blue emission of native CTZ systems.35 It should also be noted that due to its unstable imidazopyridine structure，CTZ can undergo enzyme-independent oxidation，resulting in background autoluminescence.36 Substitution at the C-2, C-5, C-6, and C-8 positions of the imidazopyrazinone core has yielded enhancements in bioluminescence properties,with changes at the C-2 position modifying the reaction rate and the C-6/C-8 positions influencing the emission spectra.37,38 One notable CTZ analog developed by Promega Corporation， ViviRen, exhibited up to a l0-fold higher signal in vivo than CTZ when paired with RLuc, while showing reduced autoluminescence.39 Recent studies and overviews covering the progress of the chemical synthesis and structure-activity studies of CTZ analogs exist for interested readers.37,40-43

In 2012,Promega Corporation synthesized furimazine,a CTZ analog containing a furan group at the C-2 position that could pair with NanoLuc,an engineered luciferase derived from the small luciferase subunit ( $\left( 1 9 \mathrm { \ k D a } \right)$ of the deep sea shrimp Oplophorus gracilirostris.44 The NanoLuc/furimazine pair produced ${ \sim } 1 5 0$ -fold greater bioluminescence in vitro compared to RLuc/CTZ,with a slightly blue-shifted emission wavelength ( $\left( 4 6 0 \mathrm { n m } \right)$ ).Because of its brightness,small size,and high stability，NanoLuc was quickly commercialized for widespread use in cell-based assays; however,its blue emission still limited in vivo applications.Yeh et al.were successful in red-shifting its emisson by engineering it to pair with the CTZ analog diphenylterazine (DTZ)，resulting in the teLuc luciferase with an emission peak at $5 0 2 \ \mathrm { \Omega n m }$ 45 Imaging in deep tissues of mice with teLuc/DTZ generated ${ \sim } 5 4$ -fold brighter emisson than FLuc/D-luciferin at an equivalent dose. Yeh and colleagues then synthesized 8pyDTZ,an analog with 4- to 14-fold enhanced solubility.46 They then performed directed evolution of teLuc to optimize pairing with 8pyDTZ, resulting in the LumiLuc luciferase which also exhibited a shifted emission peak at $5 2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ LumiLuc/8pyDTZ produced ${ \sim } 3$ -fold higher photon flux than Akaluc/AkaLumine-HCl from superficial implants in mice.

BRET-Based Luciferase Systems. In nature, multiple marine organisms have evolved bright luciferase-fluorescent protein systems that utilize the phenomenon of BRET.In BRET，the excited luciferase-bound substrate transfers its energy to an acceptor chromophore through a nonradiative dipole-dipole coupling mechanism, of which the efficiency is dependent on the spectral overlap and intermolecular distance between the two molecules (Figure 3A)． The resulting emission light from the acceptor chromophore exhibitsa red-shifted spectrum and overall higher quantum yield. Inspired by nature,multiple engineering efforts on marine luciferases have focused on using BRET to red-shift emission and enhance bioluminescence brightness.

Most of the early examples of BRET-based reporters were based on RLuc or its enhanced variants (Figure 3B).BRET6, a TurboFP635-RLuc8.6 fusion protein, enabled direct imaging of drug-mediated protein-protein interaction in deep tissues of living mice.47eBAF-Y，consisting of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP）and RLuc8，displayed 26-fold bioluminescence enhancement over RLuc and 3-fold over

RLuc8.48 In a more recent study, by replacing EYFP with Venus and extensively optimizing the unstructured linker, Saito et al.developed an enhanced BRET-based reporter termed Nano-Lantern with a 2.9 times brighter emission than eBAF-Y. Notably，the enhanced signal enabled video rate $\left( 3 0 \ \mathrm { ~ H z } \right)$ imaging of luciferase-expressing tumors in freely moving unshaved mice.49 In another interesting example,RLuc8 was fused with iRFP670 or iRFP720，phytochrome-based NIR fluorescent proteins that have an excitation peak at around 380 nm, to create reporters with NIR emission.50 Compared to NIR fluorescent in vivo imaging, NIR BLI provided 10-fold increased sensitivity,enabling detection of as low as $1 0 ^ { 4 }$ tail vein-injected MTLn3 tumor cells in the lungs of CFW mice. However， fluorescent proteins alone may still be beneficial when substrate delivery is an issue or in hypoxic regions for oxygen-dependent luciferases.

Ever since its development, NanoLuc has become a popular donor for engineering novel BRET-based reporters due to its superior catalytic efficiency over RLuc variants (Figure 3C). By replacing RLuc8 in Nano-Lantern with NanoLuc,a series of enhanced Nano-Lanterns (eNL) were reported.51 Specifically, fluorescent proteins mTurquoise2，mNeonGreen，Venus, $\mathrm { m K O } \kappa ,$ and tdTomato were chosen as BRET acceptors to generate cyan (CeNL, $4 7 5 ~ \mathrm { \ n m } ,$ ），green( $\scriptstyle \mathrm { \mathrm { G e N L } }$ ， $5 2 0 ~ \mathrm { n m } ,$ )， yellow (YeNL, $5 3 0 \ \mathrm { n m } ,$ ），orange(OeNL， $5 6 5 \ \mathrm { n m } ,$ ，and red (ReNL, $5 8 5 ~ \mathrm { \ n m } ,$ ）eNLs.Among them，CeNL and GeNL showed a roughly 2-fold increased total luminescence intensity compared to NanoLuc,while YeNL and OeNL were 4-or 1.8- fold brighter than their Nano-Lantern counterparts YNL and ONL.Meanwhile, in an independent study, two other chimeric fusion reporter proteins termed LumiFluors were developed using a similar design.52 The green LumiFluor, eGFP-NanoLuc (GpNLuc), displayed 45-fold more luminescence than YNL in vitro.In NOD/SCID mice, following a tail vein injection of 500 000 GpNLuc-expressing tumor cells，colonization could easily be detected in the lungs. The orange LumiFluor, LSSmOrange-NanoLuc (OgNLuc)，was even several fold brighter than GpNLuc for imaging allografts of mouse lymphoma cells in Albino C57Bl/6 mice.Given their similar signal intensity in vitro,this improvement in vivo supports the strategy of red-shifting luciferases for enhanced tissue penetration.

While most BRET systems exploit one copy of the fluorescent protein as the acceptor， introducing multiple copies may further enhance the BRET efficiency. On the basis of this hypothesis,two copies of CyOFP1,a bright cyanexcitable orange fluorescent protein,were fused to both the Nand C-termini of NanoLuc to create a highly sensitive bioluminescent reporter called Antares.53 When compared to the spectrally similar bioluminescent protein ONL，Antares produced 20-fold more photons across all wavelengths and 28- fold more above $6 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ in vitro.

Other engineered luciferases based on NanoLuc, such as teLuc and LumiLuc mentioned above,were also exploited as donors in BRET systems. Compared to NanoLuc/furimazine, the emission of teLuc/DTZ peaking at $5 0 2 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ overlaps better with the absorbance of CyOFP1 in Antares.Thus,NanoLuc in Antares was replaced by teLuc to generate Antares2,which consistently exhibits a $5 8 4 \mathrm { n m }$ emission peak. In BALB/c mice, when luciferase-coding plasmids were hydrodynamically delivered to have luciferases expressed in the liver，and equimolar doses of luciferase substrates were administered intraperitoneally，Antares2 exhibited an approximately $3 5 -$ $9 0 \%$ signal increase over teLuc and Antares.45 For the BRET system that utilizes LumiLuc/8pyDTZ,which is further redshifted from teLuc-DTZ,a recently reported red fluorescent protein mScarlet-I was adopted instead as the BRET acceptor.46 The resulting fusion protein mScarlet-I-LumiLuc, named LumiScarlet, has an emission peak at $6 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ and has

$5 1 \%$ of its emitted photons above $6 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ .When applied to image luciferase-expressing HeLa cells trapped in the lungs of NU/J mice with intravenously injected substrates, LumiScarlet-8pyDTZ gave a comparable signal to that from Akaluc with a comparable amount of intravenous AkaLumine-HCl, and 3- fold brighter than that from LumiLuc/8pyDTZ.

However, the brightness of Antares or LumiScarlet with the more convenient intraperitoneal injection of furimazine or 8pyDTZ does not reach the brightness attainable by AkaLuc with intraperitoneal AkaLumine delivery.30,45Two NanoLuc substrates，hydrofurimazine $\left( \mathrm { H F z } \right)$ and fluorofurimazine $\left( \mathrm { F F z } \right)$ ，with a higher aqueous solubility that can be injected into higher total amounts were recently reported.30 When coupled with Antares， these novel substrates enabled comparable or even brighter bioluminescence in vivo compared to AkaLuc/AkaLumine at limiting doses for each substrate.

# BLI SYSTEMS APPLICATION—MULTICOMPONENT BLI

In many biological studies，the need to observe different cellular events within the same animal requires the cells of interest to be tagged with multiple luciferases.Applications include investigations into the endogenous expression patterns of two distinct genes,tracking of the differentiation/activation status of individual cells by regulating the expression of each luciferase with state-dependent promoters and the traffcking of two separate cell populations such as therapeutic cells (e.g., cytotoxic T cells) and diseased cells (e.g., cancer cells). Unlike fluorescence imaging where the cells of interest can be visualized by simply switching a filter，multicomponent BLI requires more complex methods which can pose limitations on the detection sensitivity and accuracy.

One option is to use substrate-resolved luciferases,where the injection of a single substrate is used to activate the respective luciferase. This requires tagging of luciferases with minimal cross-reactivity with the other substrate(s)，also known as orthogonal luciferase-luciferin systems. The dual-BLI proof-ofconcept was first demonstrated in 2O02 by Bhaumik and Gambhir,who subcutaneously implanted C6 rat glioma cells expressing either RLuc or FLuc into single mice,followed by their sequential visualization using CTZ and D-luciferin, respectively.35 Since then, several other groups have used dual-BLI to visualize distinct molecular events or cell populations in vivo,using other luciferase pairs such as FLuc/D-luciferin and GLuc/CTZ,2 and FLuc/D-luciferin and NanoLuc/furimazine.Atriple-BLI system hasalso been demonstrated using FLuc/D-luciferin,GLuc/CTZ，and the codon-optimized luciferase from Vargula hilgendorfii (Vluc) with its substrate vargulin.64 Prescher's group has expanded the toolbox of multicomponent BLI by synthesizing novel orthogonal luciferase-luciferin systems based on FLuc/Dluciferinted $\pi$ extended luciferins enabling red-shifted emission.67 The challenge with these systems, however,remains their low sensitivity in vivo,limiting their detection capability in deep tissues.

The low sensitivity issue could be resolved with the state-ofthe-art bioluminescent reporters described above. The AkaLuc/AkaLumine pair has been used orthogonally with Antares/fluorofurimazine.With intraperitoneally administered FFz or AkaLumine, the expansion or recession of engrafted Antares-expressing MG63.3 osteosarcoma tumor and the circulation and localization of intravenously injected CAR-T cells could be sensitively visualized within the same NSG mice, over a period of $3 0 ~ \mathrm { d a y s } ^ { 3 0 }$ (Figure 4). This pair of luciferase and luciferins for dual-BLI of two cell populations is the most sensitive reported to date.

Another limitation with substrate-resolved luciferases is the need for the signal from the previous luciferase to clear, which can take hours to days.A solution to this issue was recently developed by Rathbun et al.，which relies on substrate unmixing algorithms: substrates are administered in rapid succession, beginning with the dimmest substrate,so that the residual signal from the previous luciferase becomes part of the background noise of the next.8 The set of images can then be used to deconvolute individual substrate signatures.Using this technique，Yao et al.demonstrated for the first time multicomponent imaging of four luciferase-luciferin pairs in vitro.7In 2021, Moroz et al.demonstrated quadruple-BLI in vivo with a slightly different approach,using light wavelengthblocked filters to separate signals. 69 They multiplexed RLuc, CBRLuc, CBGLuc,and a new reporter named membraneanchored Cypridina luciferase (maCLuc),which is paired with the vargulin substrate, to visualize a metastatic tumor model.

With these developments，interpretation of substrateresolved multicomponent BLI can stil be biased by differences in substrate kinetics and biodistribution.Another way to perform multicomponent BLI is through spectrally resolved luciferase pairs,whereby the injection of a single substrate produces distinct emission spectra with multiple luciferases which can be separated using spectral unmixing algorithms. This often employs green- and red-shifted mutant luciferases to minimize overlap in emission spectra.13 Mezzanotte et al. demonstrated invivo dual-BLI of human embryonic kidney cells expressing green CBG99 $( \lambda _ { \mathrm { m a x } } \ = \ 5 3 7 \ \mathrm { \ n m } )$ andred PpyRE8 $\lambda _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } = 6 1 8 ~ \mathrm { n m } ,$ luciferases. They achieved efficient spectral unmixing and sensitive imaging of distinct cell populations injected subcutaneously in mice. However, imaging in deeper tissues can be hampered by greater attenuation of the lower wavelength light which would introduce bias into quantitative comparisons. Recently, Aswendt et al. developed an improved dual-color BLI system with the further mutated $\mathbf { x } 5 \mathbf { r } / \mathbf { x } 5 \mathbf { g }$ pair showing better separated spectra and higher photon flux with the ability to accurately predict_cell population ratios from quantitative unmixing results.71The $\mathbf { x } 5 \mathbf { r } / \mathbf { x } 5 \mathbf { g }$ pair can also be coupled with infraluciferinforred-shifteddual-colorimaging.5In2021, Zambito et al. introduced a further improved NIR dual-BLI system using the substrate $\mathrm { N H } _ { 2 } { \mathrm { - N p L H } } 2$ paired with novel click beetle mutants CBG2( $\lambda _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } = 6 6 0 \mathrm { n m } ,$ and CBR2( $\lambda _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } =$ $7 3 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ).57 They showed sensitive deep tissue imaging in a lung model and were able to spectrally resolve and quantify the emissions. Furthermore， the versatility of the system was demonstrated with in vivo dual-BLI of $\mathrm { C B G 2 } / \mathrm { N H _ { 2 } } \mathrm { - N p L H 2 }$ and Akaluc/Akalumine-HCl.

# TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS

In addition to the engineering of luciferase systems at the chemical level，developments in camera technologies and imaging methods have advanced the capabilities of in vivo BLI (Table 2). In brief, these imaging systems consist of a lighttight chamber in which the subject is placed and a cooled charge-coupled device(CCD） camera which collects emited photons. The sensitivity of imaging systems has been greatly improved through the development of intensified CCD (ICCD）and electron multiplying CCD (EMCCD） cameras. This increased sensitivity has subsequently decreased acquisition times from several minutes to millseconds,_enabling video-rate imaging of unanesthetized animals.27,49,72 In addition，development of bioluminescence tomography (BLT） that incorporates CT/MRI information has aided anatomical localization in three dimensions. .73,74 Traditional CCD cameras are blue sensitive, but newer cameras have been optimized for higher quantum efficiency at wavelengths ${ \scriptstyle > 6 0 0 }$ nm，which is especially useful for imaging NIR-emitting luciferases.75 In summary， technological breakthroughs that complement chemical engineering of bioluminescent systems is expected to improve imaging sensitivity and expand future BLI applications.

# CONCLUSIONS

Over the past few decades BLI has emerged as a powerful tool for preclinical visualization of cellular and molecular processes in vivo.The high signal-to-noise ratio,direct relationship of signal to cell viability，and ability to survey processes on a whole-animal scale offers an unparalleled approach to noninvasive imaging.However, the attenuation of light by tissue raises a pressing need for the development of novel red-shifted luciferases and luciferins that can enable sensitive,deep-tissue imaging. Recent advancements in protein engineering and substrate synthesis have pushed the limits of detection,and the expanding toolbox of multicomponent BLI has improved imaging of complex cellular interactions.

The in vivo behavior of BLI systems remains incompletely understood. For substrates, in vivo evaluation should not only characterize bioluminescence output from one location but should also address pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics since these substrates act like drugs in vivo.21 An ideal synthetic luciferin should have its organ/tissue biodistribution clearly characterized,1 cause little to no toxicity or behavioral abnormalitytotheinjectedanimalorhaveitssafedosage established,and be free of background bioluminescence caused by auto-oxidation.30,31 For D-luciferin， distribution has been assessed with radioactive tracers，but this has yet to be performed for other substrates.We expect animal testing of advanced luciferase systems to be an area of growing interest as the field of BLI continues to expand.

Another interesting future development is in the combination of the most sensitive BLI reporters with other imaging methods.For example,a multimodal system consisting of a BLI reporter for ease of use and affordability with either an MRI reporter for high 3D resolution or a PET reporter for high 3D sensitivity may overcome limitations inherent to each modality.

In conclusion，we envision further development of luciferase/luciferin systems，along with in vivo testing and incorporation with other imaging reporters, to be a growing and exciting area as we continue to challenge the limits of in vivo imaging.
