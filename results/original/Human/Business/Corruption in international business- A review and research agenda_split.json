Additionally, we identified seven research streams in this growing literature: (1) the legislation against corruption, (2) the determinants of corruption, (3) combating corruption, 4) the effect of corruption on firms, (5) the political environment and corruption, (6) corruption as a challenge to existing theories of management, and (7) the effect of corruption on foreign direct investment and trade. Based on this review, we recommend that strong international laws are needed to minimize the negative impact of corruption on international business. Firms must also consider corruption when formulating strategies to increase operational efficiency and performance. Finally, corruption challenges some key assumptions of existing theories of management. Scholars need to test and expand these existing theories by considering corruption as an important issue in international business.",

      "content": "Corruption is a multidisciplinary subject that scholars from different fields and disciplines have examined and analyzed. There are studies about corruption in many disciplines such as law (Mijares, 2015), finance (Pantzalis, Chul, & Sutton, 2008; Rose-Ackerman, 2002), economics (Brada, Drabek, & Perez, 2012; He, Xie, & Zhu, 2015), accounting (Everett, Neu, & Rahaman, 2007), and international business (Cuervo-Cazurra, 2016). However, research on corruption in international business was almost non-existent before the globalization of business in the 1980s and 1990s. Globalization prompted international business researchers to investigate and discuss the context, dimensions, models, and theories about corruption as well as its association with foreign direct investment. The first paper on corruption in international business was published in 1992, and a considerable amount of literature has accumulated on the topic during the last 17 years (see Fig. 2). However, much of this literature is scattered in numerous areas and directions. Therefore, we maintain that a systematic, in-depth review that summarizes our current knowledge is essential.\n\ninternational business, we conducted a systematic, comprehensive literature review for the last 17 years between 1992 and June 2019 using bibliometric citation analysis (Fetscherin, Voss, & Gugler, 2010; White, Guldiken, Hemphill, He, & Sharifi Khoobdeh, 2016) and content analysis (Paul & Benito, 2018; Paul, Parthasarathy, & Gupta, 2017). This literature review is unique in terms of its objectives and methods, and explores several research questions: (1) What is the domain of corruption in international business? (2) What are the leading research streams? (3) What are the most influential perspectives in the literature in terms of key journals, articles, methods, data sources, measurements, and theoretical frameworks? (4) How does the literature synthesize corruption in international business? (5) What are the future research directions? As a result of our investigation, we identified 7 research streams, 6 areas in which there are gaps in our knowledge, and 14 future research questions.\n\nTable 1 Key terms and process of selecting the sample.\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"5\">(1)-Key terms entered into the HistCite software (HistCite - Glossary,2018)</td></tr><tr><td>Term</td><td>Sign</td><td colspan=\"3\">Concept/Definition</td></tr><tr><td>Total global citation</td><td>(TGC) (TLC)</td><td colspan=\"2\">TGC is the number of times an article is cited byany other articles that are available on the WoS database.</td></tr><tr><td>Total local citation</td><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">TLC is the numberof times an article is cited by the same literature sample (in ourcase,thel37articles mentioned above).</td></tr><tr><td>Total number of articles published on the subject</td><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">(PCIB) PCIB is the total number of articles published on corruption in international business.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">(2)- The processof selecting the sample from the ISI Web of Knowledge</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Seventeen keywords for corruption</td><td>Search in combination with the following words</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">(1) Corruption,(2) Bribe,(3) Bribery,(4) Abuse,(5) Crime,(6) Criminal,(7) Degradation,(8) Extortion,(9) Falsification, (10) Fraud,(11) Graft,(12) Manipulating,(13) Manipulation,(14) Misconduct,(15) Misconduct, (16) misrepresentation,and (17) wrongdoing.</td><td>International Business, Multinational Enterprise, Multinational Corporation, MNEs, MNCs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Filters applied to search in the ISI Web of Knowledge</td></tr><tr><td>(1) Search filters</td><td colspan=\"2\">Topic (Search keywords in “Title,keywords,and Abstract&quot;)</td></tr><tr><td>(2) Paper type and language</td><td colspan=\"2\">Articles and English.</td></tr><tr><td>(3) Period of search</td><td colspan=\"2\">1950 to June 2019 (1st paper published in 1992 on the subject)</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: The table lists the terms used to search the database to obtain the sample, and the data entered into the HistCite software.",

The first is that the person or firm is conducting some form of illegal activity. The second is that the person or firm is misusing power or authority in violation of existing rules and regulations or acting beyond legal limits. The third characteristic is that the person or firm is using a position of power to reap personal benefits (financial or otherwise) instead of benefiting the nation or the shareholders. Our definition is intended to be inclusive of all forms of corruption, including bribery, fraud, financial crimes, abuse, falsification, favoritism, nepotism, manipulation, and misrepresentation by public or private officials, domestically or internationally, in a social, business, or governmental context.",

      "content": "Different types of corruption are documented in the literature and include public corruption (Pontell & Geis, 2007), private corruption (Argandona, 2003), pervasive corruption, and arbitrary corruption (Rodriguez, Uhlenbruck, & Eden, 2005). Public corruption is further divided into four types: petty vs. grand corruption (Elliott, 1997) and organized vs. unorganized corruption (Shleifer & Vishny, 1993).\n\nPublic corruption can be defined as an illegal activity conducted by a government official, bureaucrat, or politician that involves the offer or receipt of financial or non-financial benefits by other government or private persons. Public corruption is classified as petty when small gifts or favors are exchanged, and as grand when large sums of money are exchanged. Public corruption is further classified as organized when it is planned, and the individuals or firms involved must pay a lump sum, and as unorganized when it is unplanned, and the individuals or firms involved pay an unspecified sum at every step of the illegal activity. In contrast to public corruption, private corruption can be defined as an illegal activity conducted by an employee, manager, or firm that involves the offer or receipt of benefits by other private or government persons. Private corruption is classified as pervasive when the employee or manager can be certain of the necessity for bribery when dealing with government officials, and as arbitrary otherwise (Cuervo-Cazurra, 2016, p. 38).\n\nCorruption can originate from either the “demand side” (the recipients of the bribe) or the “supply side” (the givers of the bribe) (Heimann & Boswell, 1998). Public and private corruption are associated with the demand side and supply side, respectively. In the international business context, Cuervo-Cazurra (2016) suggests that the demand-side incentives of government officials be distinguished from the supply-side incentives of managers. Everett, Neu, and Rahaman (2006) maintain that the demand side of corruption is the activity of a few “rotten eggs” that takes place at the individual level due to “resource scarcity.” Hamir (1999) shows that private corruption originates at the organizational level when good governance procedures and proper oversight are lacking. Caiden, Dwivedi, and Jabbra (2001) argue that both public and private corruption are endemic in individualistic societies where people are not exposed to traditional or collectivistic norms and education. Furthermore, they provide evidence that supplyside corruption in foreign investment commonly involves foreign investors who offer bribes to government officials.",

Price (1965) first championed bibliometric analysisto explore the relationships between articles based on the number of citations (Kim & McMillan, 2008), using the article as the basic unit of analysis (Alon, Anderson, Munim, & Ho, 2018). We used HistCite software for the bibliometric analysis. We present the key terms related to the bibliometric analysis in Table 1. Content analysis, which is an accepted methodology in the social sciences (Ahmed, Bahoo, Aslam, & Qureshi, 2020; Bahoo, Saeed, Iqbal, & Nawaz, 2018; Gaur & Kumar, 2018), classifies textual material by reducing it to more relevant, manageable bits of data (Weber, 1990).

      "content": "Our data collection involves three steps. First, we selected the journals from which to collect articles and citation data on the subject. To avoid selection bias in considering only top-ranked or international business journals (Terjesen, Hessels, & Li, 2013), we searched all of the journals that are listed on the ISI Web of Knowledge (henceforth WoS) database. The WoS consists of five databases covering several disciplines and provides citation data about articles dating back to 1950 (Alon et al., 2018).\n\nThe second step was to choose the sample period and the search technique. We searched all of the articles on corruption in international business published between 1950 and June 2019 using a variety of keywords. By following Alon et al. (2018), Fetscherin et al. (2010), and White et al. (2016), we used 17 keywords for corruption in combination with words such as “international business, multinational enterprises, multinational corporations, MNEs, and MNCs” to cover the complete literature on the topic. Table 1 lists the 17 keywords for corruption and key filters applied to search the literature. These searches yielded 322 articles of potential interest that we examined cursorily to confirm their relevance.\n\nIn the third step, two independent researchers read through and critically examined the 322 articles using the following criteria: the article must explicitly state that it is about corruption in international business, and it must address the subject in a non-trivial and nonmarginal way. After excluding irrelevant articles, our resulting dataset contained 137 articles. The first paper to address corruption in international business explicitly was published in 1992. As Fig. 2 illustrates, there has been continuous growth in the literature.",

We used the HistCite software program, which accepts citation data as inputs and provides several outputs, for bibliometric analysis. In the second stage, we identified influential aspects of the literature, such as key journals, articles, methods, data sources, measurements of corruption, and theoretical frameworks (RosadoSerrano et al., 2018). In the third stage, we created a taxonomy and synthesis of the literature on corruption in international business (Carvalho, Isnard, De Almeida, & Rosa, 2014). Finally, through our analysis, we presented propositions and questions for future research (Fernando & Serra, 2014; Paul & Benito, 2018).\n\n[Image]\nFig. 2.

      "content": "Co-citation mapping is the mapping of top-cited papers in relation to the papers that cite them (Alon et al., 2018). Co-citation mapping is conducted through HistCite software. We established the criteria to identify the mapping by following Alon et al. (2018), Apriliyanti and Alon (2017), and Øyna and Alon (2018). However, the criteria depend on the nature of the subject and the growth of the literature. Therefore, we utilized a two-level procedure. First, to be included in the mapping, an article must have a minimum of one total local citation $\\mathrm { ( T L C } \\geq 1 \\dot { }$ ). We identified 37 influential articles as a subsample. We then included all articles that cited these 37 influential articles in the mapping. As a result, we added 39 more papers to the subsample. Thus, the co-citation map has 76 articles, details of which appear in Table A1 (Fig. 3).\n\nIn Fig. 3, articles, represented by nodes, are positioned along the horizontal axis, and years of publication are positioned along the vertical axis. Co-citation linkages are depicted by lines that connect the nodes, and citing vs. cited articles are indicated by arrows. The size of the node reflects the magnitude of influence of an article based on total local citations received (TLC). In our citation map, the largest nodes are 20 (i.e., Rodriguez et al., 2005), 21 (Sanyal, 2005), 24 (Uhlenbruck, Rodriguez, Doh, & Eden, 2006), and 14 (Doh, Rodriguez, Uhlenbruck, Collins, & Shekshnia, 2003).\n\nWe then asked two independent researchers to conduct the content analysis of the subsample of 76 articles. The content analysis consists of a critical review of each article’s title, author, journal, research question (s), theory, data sources, variables, category, and key findings (Ahmed, Bahoo, & Ayub, 2019; Bahoo, Hassan, Paltrinieri, & Khan, 2019; Salipante, Notz, & Bigelow, 1982). As a result of this content analysis, combined with our bibliometric analysis, we were able to identify seven distinctly but interrelated research streams in the literature on corruption in international business: (1) the legislation against it, (2) its determinants, (3) combating it, (4) its effect on firms, (5) the political environment and corruption in international business, (6) corruption as a challenge to existing theories of management in international business, and (7) corruption’s effect on foreign direct investments and trade (see Fig. 3). We were also able to identify some outliers, namely, articles not cited by other articles but whose content fits in one or more of the research streams (1, 3, 36, 114, 105, 12, 102, 91, 60, and 15). We discuss these articles in their relevant research streams. The numbers refer to Fig. 3. However, there are two articles cited by other articles but whose content does not fit in any of the research streams (102 and 115) (Jiménez & Bjorvatn, 2018). Lord and Levi (2017) (no. 102 in Fig. 3) and Karhunen, Kosonen, Mccarthy, and Puffer (2018) (no. 115 in Fig. 3) discuss the financial aspects of corruption related to money laundering and corrupt exchanges in Chinese Guanxi and Russian Blat/ Svyazi, respectively.

      "content": "In the 1990s, corruption emerged as a global political issue with dire implications for international business (Kaikati, Sullivan, Virgo, Carr, & Virgo, 2000) and remained a persistent problem despite the passage of national and international legislation to control it (Nichols, 2012). Everett et al. (2006) (no. 23 in Fig. 3) argue that existing anticorruption laws need to be updated by all relevant regulatory bodies. The United States was the first country to pass laws prohibiting corruption by individuals or firms, namely, the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) (Hotchkiss, 1998) (no. 4 in Fig. 3). However, Klaw (2012) (no. 60 in Fig. 3) maintains that the FCPA is unable to prevent and punish demand-side corruption in business transactions. Kaikati et al. (2000) (no. 9 in Fig. 3) have recommended that the OECD broaden the scope of the FCPA and adopt the amended version in full. In 1997, for the first time, the UN, OECD, and EU convened to discuss passing legislation against bribery and corruption (Mijares, 2015) (no. 80 in Fig. 3). The guidelines of the UN’s 1996 declaration, the OECD’s 1997 convention, and the EU’s 1997 convention were the foundation of current anti-corruption laws (Gantz, 1998). Under these guidelines many developed and emerging economies have established national anti-corruption laws in international business, including Canada (Mijares, 2015) (no. 80 in Fig. 3), the US (Spalding, 2011) (no. 54 in Fig. 3), and the EU (Pacini, Swingen, & Rogers, 2002) (no. 11 in Fig. 3). Moreover, the OECD convention provides guidelines for member states to establish uniform laws and policies (Pacini et al., 2002).

      "content": "The dominant research stream in the literature is the determinants of corruption in international business. Carmichael (1995) presents three common situations in which a multinational enterprise becomes involved in corruption in a host country. The first is when the company is unable to engage in a new business transaction or complete an existing one without offering a bribe. The second is when the legal institutions in the host country are weak. The third is when the multinational firm is involved in corruption in its home country as well.\n\nOne group of studies argues that the determinant of corruption is the firm. Chen, Cullen, and Parboteeah (2015) (no. 82 in Fig. 3) explore the relationship between culture, management, shareholder control, and a firm’s propensity to bribe. They find that manager-controlled firms are more likely than shareholder-controlled firms to engage in bribery.\n\nThe second group of studies maintains that the determinant of corruption is cultural factors. Based on a survey they conducted, Guvenli and Sanyal (2012) (no. 56 in Fig. 3) explore whether attitudes toward bribery differ between men and women in international business. They found that men are more inclined toward bribery than women. Recently, Tuliao and Chen (2017) (no. 99 in Fig. 3) analyzed gender as a determinant of bribery among CEOs and found that male CEOs are more likely to be involved in corruption. Relatedly, Frei, and Muethel (2017) (no. 103 in Fig. 3) argue that the host country provides a breeding ground for multinational firms for corruption through weak values and laws. Therefore, regional characteristics are significant determinants of corruption (Sanyal & Samanta, 2017) (no. 98 in Fig. 3).\n\nFinally, the third group of studies claims that the determinant of corruption is economic factors. Sanyal (2005) (no. 21 in Fig. 3) suggests that countries with low per capita income and poor income distribution, and those that score high on Hofstede’s scales of power distance and masculinity are more inclined toward bribery. Similarly, Sanyal and Guvenli (2009) (no. 33 in Fig. 3) show that firms from countries where the power distance or the long-term orientation is low, and individualism is high are less involved in corruption. Baughn, Bodie, Buchanan, and Bixby (2010) (no. 41 in Fig. 3) confirm that firms from countries that score high on power distance are more likely to be involved in bribery. Mazar and Aggarwal (2011) (no. 51 in Fig. 3) find that bribery varies with the degree of collectivism. Huang, Liu, Zheng, Tan, & Zhao, 2015 (no. 81 in Fig. 3) argue that concern about evaluations plays a moderating role between collectivism and corruption: collectivism facilitates corruption in countries where there is little concern about evaluations.",

The major research question in this stream is related to the practical effectiveness of laws, the adoption of ethical standards, and the implementation of legal frameworks to combat corruption.\n\nHotchkiss (1998) (no. 4 in Fig. 3) argues that the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was considered just a moral obligation until the US government began enforcing it in 1998. Kaczmarek and Newman (2011) show that extraterritorial intervention by US prosecutors to reduce corruption and bribery in target countries is effective. Weber and Getz (2004) (no. 17 in Fig. 3) review the efforts of the EU, US, and OECD to combat corruption. Cuervo-Cazurra (2008) (no. 30 in Fig. 3) advocates an increase in the scope of implementation of existing anticorruption laws and a reduction in investment in corrupt countries by signatories to the OECD convention.\n\nRose-Ackerman (2002) (no. 12 in Fig. 3) considers abstention from corruption to be the moral responsibility of the firms and argues that the formation of ethical standards can be helpful in this regard. Kaptein (2004) (no. 15 in Fig. 3) reviews the business codes and standards of 200 of the largest firms and finds that $4 6 \\%$ of them have ethical codes against corruption. Osuji (2011) (no. 52 in Fig. 3) highlights the importance of ethical corporate social responsibility (CSR) to combat corruption. Rodriguez et al. (2005) (no. 20 in Fig. 3) analyze the effect of public corruption on multinational enterprises in terms of organizational legitimacy, strategic decision-making, and entry choice. Cleveland et al.

Lambsdorff (2013) (no. 65 in Fig. 3) argues that firms should be liable for the illegal activities of the corrupt intermediaries with whom they engage in business transactions. Petrou (2014) (no. 84 in Fig. 3) finds that arbitrary corruption hurts the performance of subsidiaries.

Luo (2006) (no. 26 in Fig. 3) uses a structuration model to show that in a highly corrupt environment, multinational enterprises with a high level of ethics bargain with governments, while less ethical firms use social and political connections to engage in bribe-giving. Chen, Ding, and Kim (2010) (no. 47 in Fig. 3) find that corruption has more influence on the earnings forecasts of highly politically connected firms than less politically connected ones. Boubakri, Mansi, and Saffar (2013) (no. 64 in Fig. 3) document that sound political institutions have a positive effect on corporate risk-taking when government extraction is high, and the level of corruption is low. Yim, Lu, and Choi (2017) (no. 100 in Fig. 3) show that in business transactions, political lobbying has a more positive impact on firm performance than bribery. Brockman, Rui, and Zou (2013) (no. 67 in Fig. 3) find that where there are strong legal institutions or a low level of corruption, politically connected firms’ post-merger and acquisition performance is low compared to that of non-political firms.

It often provides counterexamples to many existing theories of management in international business because the unethical, criminal nature of corruption challenges certain assumptions of those theories. For example, Gomes et al. (2018) (no. 106 in Fig. 3) find that contrary to the self-selection theory, if the level of corruption is high, productivity does not have a positive effect on the value of exports. After reviewing the literature related to the firm’s response to government corruption, Galang (2012) (no. 58 in Fig. 3) summarizes the key theories that support its strategies, such as institutional economics, institutionalism, resource dependence, public choice, social network, and stakeholder theory. Doh et al. (2003) (no. 14 in Fig. 3) explore the impact of government corruption on multinational enterprises. They provide a framework based on two dimensions of government corruption: pervasiveness and arbitrariness. The framework proposes several strategies that firms should adopt to respond to corruption: avoidance, adjusting their entry mode, corporate codes of conduct, training, development and public education, social contributions and public donations, and laws and agreements. Cuervo-Cazurra (2016) (no. 88 in Fig. 3) proposes expanding this approach by considering corruption as a laboratory. He reviews and recommends extensions of several theories: agency theory, transaction cost economics, the resource-based view, resource dependence, and neo-institutional theory. He also argues that the agency and resource-dependence theories are best for explaining the causes of corruption, whereas the resource-based view and neo-institutional theory are more appropriate for exploring the consequences of corruption. Transaction cost theory is best for determining how to control corruption in international business.",

Jiménez, Marcelus, Guoliang, & Jiang, 2017 (no. 104 in Fig. 3) show that hostcountry corruption is positively related to a high failure rate of private participation projects.

The power of the host country’s institutional environment in terms of its control of corruption and the rule of law shapes and affects the firms’ entry strategy (Uhlenbruck et al., 2006), decisions about engaging in international joint ventures (IJVs) (Roy & Oliver, 2009), the composition of the board of these joint ventures (Hearn, 2015), the appointment of national managers (Muellner, Klopf, & Nell, 2017), and bribery behavior (Baughn et al., 2010; Yi, Teng, & Meng, 2017) in cross-national transactions. The institutional environment of host and home countries, of which the level of corruption is one factor, affects a firm’s export performance (Krammer, Strange, & Lashitew, 2018), management of earnings (Lewellyn & Rosey, 2017), merger and acquisition activities (Tunyi & Ntim, 2016), and location of foreign direct investment (Dikova, Panibratov, Veselova, & Ermolaeva, 2016).\n\nFurthermore, the institutional theory raises concerns about how a corrupt institutional environment influences corporate social responsibility (Keig et al., 2015), profitability (Lee & Hong, 2012), values (Pantzalis et al., 2008), organizational legitimacy and strategic decision making (Rodriguez et al., 2005). This theory holds that the quality of institutions defines the level of corruption in the host and home country, which influences the nations and firms. The literature suggests that by improving the quality of institutions, the adverse effects of corruption can be minimized in international business.\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Author(s)/Global Citations*</td><td>Purpose</td><td>Sample</td><td>Dependent Variables</td><td>Independent Variables</td><td>Findings</td></tr><tr><td>Tsalikis and Latour (1995)/29</td><td>-How does culture perceive bribery and extortion? -What is the effect of Greek and US culture</td><td>- 240 American and Greek business students</td><td>-Perceived bribery and extortion</td><td>-Culture variables</td><td>-Greeks receive and offer bribery mor Americans. -Greek culture impacts more perceivec</td></tr><tr><td>Zhu (2017)/11</td><td>on bribery and extortion? -What is the effect of MNEs&#x27;activity on the level of corruption in developing countries?</td><td>-Case study of China</td><td>-Corruption</td><td>-MNEs&#x27; activity</td><td>bribery and extortion. -MNCs&#x27;activities contribute to rent cr in developing countries,which leads t level of corruption. -In China,the provinces with more M</td></tr><tr><td>Sanyal and Guvenli (2009)/12</td><td>-What is the effect of national culture on a firm&#x27;s propensity to bribe?</td><td>-30 countries -Period: 2006</td><td>-Bribe payers&#x27;index</td><td>-Cultural variables</td><td>activities are strongly associated with corruption. -Firms from countries low on power d or long-term orientation,or high on individualism,are less likelytogag bribe giving,but economic developme impacts this relationship.</td></tr><tr><td>Chen et al.

It suggests that isomorphism, which is a process that forces one unit to resemble other units in the population because they face the same set of environments, plays a role in corruption (Hawley, 1968). Isomorphism consists of three mechanisms: coercive, mimetic, and normative (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). Currently, the neo-institutional perspective is quite popular in the organizational field and international business. It maintains that firms respond to the cognitive, normative, and regulatory pressures on other firms that are considered legitimate (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). Gao (2010) uses the neo-institutional framework to examine the effect of mimetic isomorphism on bribery by firms working in China. He confirms that the firms’ bribery behavior reflects the habits of other companies in China. This theory explains the firms’ choice about when to engage in corrupt practices themselves and when their subsidiaries do so as well (Lambsdorff, 2013). Cuervo-Cazurra (2016) also recommends extending the neo-institutional theory by considering corruption as a laboratory.",

      "content": "Jensen and Meckling (1976) developed agency theory, which maintains that managers try to divert corporate resources to maximize private benefits at the cost of shareholders because incentives are lacking. Agency theory explains that this behavior creates investment risks and produces the agency problem in international business. In addition to agency problems, Stulz (2005) argues that there is a potential link between political institutions and the managers’ choice of investment risks. Political institutions are managed by governments, which play an important role in the firm managers’ decision making through the strict rule of law, overregulation, and level of corruption. Political institutions and the level of corruption affect corporate risk-taking decisions, and politically connected firms take more risks, which leads to agency problems (Boubakri et al., 2013). This theory explains the potential conflict between the firm’s headquarters and its foreign subsidiaries in cases of offering bribes due to political connections (Yi et al., 2017). Firms have two options: lobbying or bribery in the host country. The effect of lobbying in the host country is more positive than offering bribes (Yi et al., 2017). Agency theory suggests that manager-controlled firms offer more bribes than shareholder-controlled firms due to conflicting goals, a theory that Chen et al. (2015) confirmed empirically. There are associations between bribery and the corrupt behavior of firms and the characteristics of boards of governance such as CEO duality (Das-Gupta & Wu, 2008), manager, or shareholder-controlled firms (Chen et al., 2015), and gender (Tuliao & Chen, 2017).

(2017) confirm that lobbying adds more value to a firm than bribery.\n\nThe transaction cost theory provides details of a firm’s behavior based on the cost of its economic transactions. Bribery and corruption are viewed as an additional cost of operating nationally and internationally because they result in uncertainty in the relationship between the firm and the government (Cuervo-Cazurra, 2016).

One study utilizes this theory to analyze how firm managers in host countries gain the support of government officials by providing them with bribes because a foreign company has less power than local firms (Cuervo-Cazurra, 2016). Petrou (2015) uses the resource dependence viewpoint to document that the arbitrariness of corruption in a host country has a negative impact on a subsidiary’s performance.\n\nThe greatest limitation of most of the theories used to investigate corruption in international business is the lack of clarity in explaining the multidisciplinary and complex dynamics of corruption at the country and firm levels.

      "content": "Country-level antecedents play a crucial role as determinants of corruption in home and host countries. The key factors identified in research stream one (legislation against corruption in international business) are the lack of international laws (Everett et al., 2006 ; Nichols, 2012) and non-enforcement of the OECD convention and FCPA in non-member countries (Kaikati et al., 2000 ; Klaw, 2012). Therefore, it is essential to increase the bilateral implementation of anti-corruption laws through groups such as the WTO and the World Bank (CuervoCazurra, 2008).\n\nIn research stream two, scholars identified three factors that influence corruption: economic factors (Chen et al., 2015; Lopatta, Jaeschke, Tchikov, & Lodhia, 2017; Sanyal & Samanta, 2017; Sanyal, 2005), cultural factors (Roy & Goll, 2014), and other factors (Gao, 2011 ; Sanyal & Samanta, 2017). Sanyal and Guvenli (2009) and Baughn et al. (2010) document the significant effect of economic and national cultural factors on the likelihood of individuals and firms to engage in bribery (see also Hofstede, 1980). Gelbrich, Stedham, and Gathke (2016) identify and resolve some discrepancies in the measurement of cultural factors and confirm them as determinants of corruption. Frei and Muethel (2017), Sanyal (2005), and Sanyal and Guvenli (2009) show that national cultural and economic factors lead to corrupt activities in both home and host countries.",

It maintains that firms respond to the cognitive, normative, and regulatory pressures of the community and society where they operate (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983).

Therefore, managers and policymakers need to consider corruption when formulating the firms’ organizational structure and creating strategies to increase operational efficiency and performance. Third, the establishment of an organizational anti-corruption architecture system in firms is essential to overcome corruption in international business. Finally, corruption challenges some key assumptions of existing theories of management.
