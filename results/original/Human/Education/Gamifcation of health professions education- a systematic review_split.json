      "content": "Gamifcation refers to using game attributes in a non-gaming context. Health professions educators increasingly turn to gamifcation to optimize students’ learning outcomes. However, little is known about the concept of gamifcation and its possible working mechanisms. This review focused on empirical evidence for the efectiveness of gamifcation approaches and theoretical rationales for applying the chosen game attributes. We systematically searched multiple databases, and included all empirical studies evaluating the use of game attributes in health professions education. Of 5044 articles initially identifed, 44 met the inclusion criteria. Negative outcomes for using gamifcation were not reported. Almost all studies included assessment attributes $\\mathrm { ( n = 4 0 ) }$ , mostly in combination with confict/challenge attributes $\\left( \\mathrm { n } = 2 7 \\right)$ ). Eight studies revealed that this specifc combination had increased the use of the learning material, sometimes leading to improved learning outcomes. A relatively small number of studies was performed to explain mechanisms underlying the use of game attributes $( \\mathrm { n } = 7 )$ ). Our fndings suggest that it is possible to improve learning outcomes in health professions education by using gamifcation, especially when employing game attributes that improve learning behaviours and attitudes towards learning. However, most studies lacked well-defned control groups and did not apply and/or report theory to understand underlying processes. Future research should clarify mechanisms underlying gamifed educational interventions and explore theories that could explain the efects of these interventions on learning outcomes, using well-defned control groups, in a longitudinal way. In doing so, we can build on existing theories and gain a practical and comprehensive understanding of how to select the right game elements for the right educational context and the right type of student.",

This is at least suggested by the number of peer-reviewed scientifc publications on gamifcation in this feld, which has increased almost tenfold over the past 5  years. At the same time, there seems to be little shared understanding of what constitutes gamifcation and how this concept difers from other, related concepts. Furthermore, according to business and education literature, there is still no clear understanding of when and why gamifcation can be an appropriate learning and instructional tool (Dicheva et al. 2015; Landers et al. 2015). The purpose of this systematic review was to provide a comprehensive overview of the use and efectiveness of gamifcation in health professions education and to add to the existing research on gamifcation in several ways. To this end, we frst clearly and carefully distinguished gamifcation studies from studies investigating other types of game-based learning. Then, we summarized the contexts in which the gamifcation interventions took place and their underlying theories. Finally, we analysed the efects of individual game elements by using a conceptual framework that was originally developed by Landers et al. to structure game elements in other, non-educational domains (Landers 2014).",

      "content": "The use of game design elements to enhance academic performance (e.g., learning attitudes, learning behaviours and learning outcomes) is known as gamifcation or ‘gamifed learning’ (Deterding et al. 2011). Due to the rapidly growing body of information and proliferation of different types of game-based learning (e.g. serious games), authors tend to use diferent terms for the same concept, or the same term for diferent concepts (for examples see Amer et al. 2011; Borro-Escribano et al. 2013; Chan et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2015; Frederick et al. 2011; Gerard et al. 2018; Lim and Seet 2008; Stanley and Latimer 2011; Webb and Henderson 2017). In part, this indiscriminate use of terms may be caused by the fact that in the literature of play and gaming there is neither consensus on what a ‘game’ is conceptually (Arjoranta 2014; Caillois 1961; Huizinga 1955; Ramsey 1923; Salen and Zimmerman 2004; Suits 1978; Sutton-Smith 2000), nor on what the essential elements of a game are (Bedwell et al. 2012; Klabbers 2009).\n\nSince there was a lack of uniformity in the defnitions of the main forms of game-based learning—gamifcation, serious games, and simulations—we chose well-known, academically accepted defnitions to distinguish among the three concepts that guided the search strategy and enabled selection of articles relevant for this systematic review. First, although various defnitions of gamifcation can be found in various felds of literature such as business, education and information technology (Blohm and Leimeister 2013; Burke 2014; Burkey et al. 2013; De Sousa Borges et al. 2014; Domínguez et al. 2013; Gaggioli 2016; Hamari et al. 2014; Hsu et al. 2013; Huotari and Hamari 2012, 2017; Kumar 2013; Muntean 2011; Perrotta et al. 2013; Robson et al. 2015; Simões et al. 2013; Warmelink et al. 2018; Zuk 2012), a commonly applied defnition is that of Deterding et al. (De-Marcos et al. 2014; Deterding et al. 2011; Dicheva et al. 2015; Lister et al. 2014; Mekler et al. 2017; Sailer et al. 2017; Seaborn and Fels 2015). He and his colleagues defne gamifcation as the use of game elements (e.g. points, leader boards, prizes) in non-gaming contexts (Deterding et al. 2011). This implies that, even though game elements are used in a certain context (such as education), there should be no intention of creating a game. Second, this intention is diferent from the intention in serious games, which are defned as games (in their various forms) in which education is the primary goal, rather than entertainment (Susi et al. 2007). Serious games address real-world topics in a gameplay context. In contrast to gamifcation, serious game designers’ intention is to create a game. Therefore, the characteristic diference between gamifcation and serious games lies in their design intention. Third, a simulation can be defned as a situation in which a particular set of conditions is created artifcially in order to study or experience something that could exist in reality (Oxford English Dictionary 2017). Simulations provide instant feedback on performance, which is delivered as accurate and realistic as possible in a safe environment (Alessi 1988; Vallverdú 2014). Simulations do not need game elements like a scoring system and a win/lose condition. However, game-design techniques and solutions can be employed to create the simulated reality and the experience of something real (Alessi 1988; Jacobs and Dempsey 1993). Simulations are therefore best seen as learning activities that necessarily carry some game intention, but do not use game elements. By explicitly adding the designers’ intentions to the chosen defnitions for these three types of game-based learning, we established criteria for distinguishing between them and guiding study inclusion and analysis in this systematic review.",

      "content": "In academic literature, various game elements have been proposed to improve the learning experience in gamifcation, e.g. rewards, leader boards and social elements (Petrucci et  al. 2015; Van Dongen et al. 2008). In addition, grey literature also lists vast amounts of diferent types of game elements (Marczewski 2017), which—though lacking an academic framework or basis—have been used in previous research (Wells 2018). Diferent terminology is used for the same type of game-elements; for example, badges (Davidson and Candy 2016), donuts (Fleiszer et al. 1997) and iPads (Kerfoot and Kissane 2014) are all types of rewards. In a recent systematic review on serious games (and gamifcation), Gorbanev et al. (2018) ascertained a lack of consensus regarding terminology used in games and welcomed any efort to reduce this terminological variety. Therefore, to make the results of gamifcation research in health professions education more comprehensive and transferable with regard to the game elements involved, we applied a conceptual framework of aggregated game elements that was originally proposed by Bedwell et al. (2012) and Wilson et al. (2009), and later modifed by Landers (2014) (Table 2; “Appendix”). This framework posits that all existing game elements can be described and structured into nine attributes, while avoiding signifcant overlap between these attributes (Bedwell et al. 2012). The following game attributes are included in the framework: action language, assessment, confict/challenge, control, environment, game fction, human interaction, immersion and rule/goals. Instead of only focusing on specifc game elements, we chose to use this framework to identify whether there is a class of game elements that hold the highest promise of improving health professions education. In doing so, we added a new perspective to existing reviews on gamifcation in higher (Caponetto et al. 2014; De Sousa Borges et al. 2014; Dichev and Dicheva 2017; Dicheva et al. 2015; Faiella and Ricciardi 2015; Nah et al. 2014; Subhash and Cudney 2018) and health professions education (Gentry et al. 2016; McCoy et al. 2016). In addition, we attempted to uncover the theory underpinning the gamifed interventions reported in this systematic review. In doing so, we responded to the call for more theory-driven medical education research (Bligh and Parsell 1999; Bligh and Prideaux 2002; Cook et al. 2008), which we felt should also apply to research on game-based learning in general and gamifcation in particular (Caponetto et al. 2014; De Sousa Borges et al. 2014; Faiella and Ricciardi 2015; Gentry et al. 2016; McCoy et al. 2016; Nah et al. 2014).\n\nThis study, therefore, was intended to contribute to the literature (including existing systematic reviews) in several ways: (1) by creating a sharper distinction between gamifcation and other forms of game-based learning; (2) by using a more generic way to structure game elements; and (3) by responding to the call for more theory-driven medical education research.\n\nIn sum, this systematic review aimed to provide teachers and researchers with a comprehensive overview of the current state of gamifcation in health professions education, with a particular focus on the efects of gamifcation elements on learning, the underlying mechanisms and considerations for future research.\n\nWe formulated fve principal research questions that guided this systematic review:\n\n1. What are the contexts in which game elements are used in health sciences education?\n2. What game elements are tested and what attributes do they represent?\n3. Is there empirical evidence for the efectiveness of gamifed learning in health professions education?\n4. What is the quality of existing research on gamifed learning in health professions education?\n5. What is the theoretical rationale for implementing gamifed learning in health professions education?",

Together, we identifed keywords, key phrases, synonyms and alternative keywords for gamifcation as well as game elements and attributes that were derived from a list of 52 game elements and Landers’ framework. Some of the 52 game elements and attributes were omitted from the search as they were too broad and generated a huge amount of hits (e.g., ‘environment’, ‘scarcity’, ‘consequences’), irrelevant hits or as they did not generate any hits (e.g. ‘Easter eggs’).

(2008). They distinguished studies as focusing on description, justifcation and clarifcation. Description studies make no comparison, focus on observation and describe what was done. Justifcation studies make comparisons between interventions, generally lack or do not present a conceptual framework or a predictive model and describe whether the new intervention worked. Clarifcation studies apply a theoretical framework to understand and possibly explain the processes underlying the observed efects, describe why and how interventions (i.e. gamifcation) work and illuminate paths of future directions (Cook et al. 2008).\n\nWe classifed all included studies as descriptive, justifcation or clarifcation.",

Whether or not increased use ensured improved learning remained uncertain. For instance, two comparable studies using assessment and confict/challenge attributes each reported increased use of simulators, but did not investigate or report learning outcomes (Kerfoot and Kissane 2014; Van Dongen et al. 2008). Two diferent studies in which the same gamifed elements were used also found that the use of simulators had increased (El-Beheiry et  al. 2017; Petrucci et  al. 2015), but only one study found improved performance (ElBeheiry et al. 2017).\n\nOne study focused on the level of health care outcome (Kerfoot et al. 2014). This randomized controlled trial had the highest MERSQI score and investigated whether gamifcation in an online learning activity could improve primary care clinicians’ hypertension management. The intervention group participated in a gamifed, spaced learning activity comprising three game elements: competition, space-learning and scoring. The control group received the same spaced education through online postings. The gamifcation intervention was associated with a modest reduction in numbers of days to reach the target blood pressure in a subgroup of already hypertensive patients. That study did not uncover the underlying mechanisms of how gamifcation supported these positive patient outcomes. A proper theory was also lacking or not presented. Because of the study design, we were not able to disentangle whether competition, spaced learning, scoring, or a combination of them had caused the efect. In fact, adopting and testing a combination of game elements without being able to disentangle their individual efects on learning is a quite general phenomenon in gamifcation research in health professions education.",

      "content": "The hallmark of clarifcation studies is the use of theory to explain the processes that underlie observed efects (Cook et al. 2008). In most studies $\\mathrm { ( n } = 5 \\mathrm { ) }$ , multiple game attributes were related to a chosen theory. In three out of the seven clarifcation studies, the authors referred to Experiential Learning Theory (El Tantawi et  al. 2018; Koivisto et  al. 2016; Verkuyl et al. 2017) and in each of the remaining four studies the authors referred to a diferent theory: Reinforcement Learning Theory (Chen et al. 2017), Social Comparison Theory (Van Nuland et al. 2015), Self-Directed Learning (Fleiszer et al. 1997) and Deliberate Practice Theory (Butt et al. 2018). Each theory will be discussed briefy below, with specifc attention to how these theories can be linked to game elements.\n\nExperiential Learning Theory states that concrete experience provides information that serves as a basis for refection. After this refection, learners think of ways to improve themselves and, after this abstract conceptualization, they will try to improve their behaviours accordingly (Kolb et al. 2000; Kolb and Boyatzis 2001). Some researchers assumed that by gamifying their courses, students’ experiences and, consequently, their understanding (through refection and conceptualization) might be enhanced. For instance, dentistry students’ experiences of being a part of an exciting narrative in an academic writing course, including game elements like role-playing, feedback, points, badges, leader boards and a clear storyline, were assumed to improve their performance (El Tantawi et al. 2018).\n\nSelf-Directed Learning is the process of diagnosing one’s own learning needs, formulating one’s own learning goals and planning one’s own learning trajectory. The increased autonomy in the pursuit of knowledge is assumed to result in higher motivation (Knowles 1980). Gamifcation that was inspired by Self-Directed Learning involved quizzes that were fully developed by small groups of medical students or residents about a self-chosen subject of their surgical intensive care unit rotation, right answers were rewarded with donuts (Fleiszer et al. 1997).\n\nDeliberate Practice Theory is based on engaging already motivated students to become experts via well-defned goals, real world tasks and immediate and informative feedback (Butt et al. 2018; Ericsson et al. 1993). Deliberate Practice Theory was applied to develop an educational tool using game-elements (such as points and time constrains) and virtual reality to practice urinary catheterization in nursing education (Butt et al. 2018).\n\nTwo studies stood out for the way in which they used theory to explain the efect of a single game attribute. Van Nuland et al. (2015) used social comparison theory to explain the efect of competition and Chen et al. (2017) used Reinforcement Learning Theory to explain the efect of direct feedback in digital learning.\n\nAccording to the Social Comparison Theory, social comparison is a fundamental mechanism for modifying judgment and behaviour through the inner drive individuals have to gain accurate self-evaluations (Corcoran et al. 2011; Festinger 1954). Gamifcation based on Social Comparison Theory involved the introduction of leader boards. According to\n\nVan Nuland et  al. improved performance would be achieved by letting students identify discrepancies in their knowledge through upward comparison or validate their assumptions on knowledge through downward comparison (Van Nuland et al. 2015).\n\nReinforcement Learning Theory relates to a form of behavioural learning that is dependent on rewards and punishments (Börgers and Sarin 1997). If a desired behaviour or action is followed by a reward, individuals’ tendency to perform that action will increase. Punishment will decrease individuals’ tendency to perform that action. The gamifcation study based on this theory assumed that rewards and punishments (e.g. receiving points or negative, red-coloured responses, respectively) would improve the subjective learning experience and help learners acquire implicit skills in radiology (Chen et al. 2017).\n\nAlthough diferent theories predicted the efectiveness of diferent mechanisms to improve performance, a common assumption seemed to be that the use of game attributes would improve learning outcomes by changing learning behaviours or attitudes towards learning.",

No negative efects of using gamifcation were observed. Almost all interventions included assessment game attributes, mostly in combination with confict/challenge attributes. Especially this combination of attributes was found to increase the use of learning materials, sometimes leading to improved learning outcomes. Our review revealed a relatively small number of studies involving high-quality control groups, which limited recommendations for evidence-based teaching practice. In addition, high-quality clarifcation studies on how underlying mechanisms could explain the observed efects are uncommon in gamifed learning research. In most studies, an explicit theory of learning was not presented and an appropriate control group was lacking. Of the few studies that did refer to theory, most researchers essentially proposed that the game element(s) under study would strengthen attitudes or behaviours towards learning, which in turn might positively infuence the learning outcomes.",

      "content": "At frst glance, it may seem that improved or unchanged academic performance (e.g. learning behaviours, attitudes towards learning or learning outcomes) can justify the use of gamifcation in health professions education. However, caution should be taken in drawing strong conclusions, because most studies were descriptive, (confounded) justifcation or (confounded) clarifcation studies, or clarifcation studies that did not include control groups (total $\\mathrm { n } { = } 3 6$ ). In sum, despite the apparent encouraging early results, it remains unclear whether the reported efects on academic performance can be solely attributed to the gamifed interventions due to the absence of (non-confounded) control-groups. The remaining eight studied included in our study were well-controlled studies using assessment and confict/challenge attributes, so these study results could be interpreted with more confdence. The use of the learning material was increased in all intervention groups compared to their control groups (El-Beheiry et al. 2017; Kerfoot and Kissane 2014; Kerfoot et al. 2014; Petrucci et al. 2015; Scales et al. 2016; Van Dongen et al. 2008; Van Nuland et al. 2015; Worm and Buch 2014), often in combination with improved learning outcomes (ElBeheiry et al. 2017; Kerfoot et al. 2014; Scales et al. 2016; Van Nuland et al. 2015; Worm and Buch 2014). Using confict/challenge and assessment attributes, especially competition and scoring, therefore seemed to positively infuence learning. The apparently consistent efect of gamifcation is promising but also warrants further investigation. First, gamifcation research is still much in its infancy, it should be recognized that positive results may have been overreported due to a publication bias (Kerr et al. 1977; Møllerand and Jennions 2001) and that negative results remain un- or underreported. Second, so far, mainly smallscale and pilot studies have been conducted, which is not just typical of health professions education but also applies to areas where gamifcation is already more often used, such as computer sciences (Dicheva et al. 2015). Third, it is important to realise that gamifcation can also have unexpected or unwanted efects (Andrade et al. 2016). Competition, which is one of the most frequently used game elements in this review, is particularly interesting in that regard. In theory, competition can hamper learning by turning projects into a race to the fnish line. In this case, participating in a gamifed learning activity might diminish learning: winning becomes more important than the internalisation of knowledge and/or skills. This shift in attention from task to competition might, therefore, come at the expense of students’ performance and even their intrinsic motivation to learn (Reeve and Deci 1996). For example, in our review, four studies involving simulators showed that competition leads to increased use of the simulators (e.g., for a longer time and more frequently) (El-Beheiry et al. 2017; Kerfoot et al. 2014; Petrucci et al. 2015; Van Dongen et al. 2008). However, only one of these studies reported improved learning outcomes (El-Beheiry et al. 2017). That this outcome was not found in the other three studies might be attributed to a shift in attention as explained before. Increased use of learning material generally indicated repetition, which is one of the most powerful variables to afect memory, leading to improved learning outcomes and retention (Hintzman 1976; Kerfoot et al. 2009; Murre and Dros 2015; Slamecka and McElree 1983). However, as a corollary from using gamifcation in learning, repetition may become less efective when students’ attention shifts from the learning task to, for instance, competition. So even though repetition is vital for knowledge retention, increased repetition of the learning material in gamifed interventions might not necessarily beneft learning, especially when students get distracted by game elements. Similarly, shifts of motivation may occur with diferent game attributes. In interventions applying the game attribute assessment, for example, the elements scoring and rewards are frequently used. However, giving rewards for a previously unrewarded activity can lead to a shift from intrinsic to extrinsic motivation and even loss of interest in the activity when the rewards are no longer given. This is also called the over-justifcation efect (Deci et al. 1999, 2001; Hanus and Fox 2015; Landers et al. 2015; Lepper et al. 1973). In such cases, students’ motivation might shift from being internally driven to learn to being externally driven by gamifcation, possibly ending with amotivation when the gamifed activities are over.\n\nWe did not fnd a direct indication that the efects of game attributes were dependent on contextual factors, since all included studies reported positive results. However, we did fnd that a combination of confict and challenge attributes was more often used in the context of postgraduate education and in digital modalities. Whether this implies that opting for digital modalities is better suited to postgraduate courses or whether digital modalities are better suited for a combination of confict and challenge attributes remains uncertain. Future research should investigate whether other game attributes and/or modalities are also applicable to postgraduate students. In addition, researchers might focus on identifying reasons for choosing specifc (combinations of) attributes in a specifc context.",

It was not the aim of this study to evaluate this method, however, future researchers may want to re-evaluate before applying it to systematic analyses. Coding was relatively easy which may imply that game-elements are over-generalized. For instance, points, badges, iPads and money are kinds of rewards and, therefore, confrmed as assessment attributes. However, the timing of the rewards (e.g., immediate versus delayed rewards) as well as the context of the rewards (e.g., negative or positive feedback) might have a diferent impact on the outcomes (Ashby and O’Brien 2007; Bermudez and Schultz 2014; Butler et al. 2007). Consequently, the claim that assessment attributes can increase or improve learning is insufciently substantiated, or at least incomplete. Besides, some attributes appeared to have much overlap: immersion and environment attributes were almost always implemented in conjunction. This conceptual framework was helpful in guiding our review and interpreting the results, although some work is needed to refne its contents.",

      "content": "The purpose of theory is to generate hypotheses, predict (learning) outcomes and explain underlying mechanisms. Unfortunately, most identifed studies on gamifcation in health professions education were not based on theory, or theoretical considerations were not included or not yet elaborated. Our review showed that researchers who did use theory hypothesized that efective gamifed learning might strengthen students’ learning behaviours or positive attitudes towards learning, which in turn might improve their learning outcomes. For instance, in studies referring to ELT (El Tantawi et al. 2018; Koivisto et al. 2016; Verkuyl et al. 2017), it was assumed that incorporating gamifcation into courses could enhance students’ experience and, therefore, their refection on and conceptualization of that experience (Kolb et al. 2001). For example, El Tantawi et al. (2018) used story-telling and game-terminology (together with other game-elements) to improve students’ attitudes towards academic writing. This way, the researchers intended to modify students’ perceptions of a task and made it seem like an exciting adventure, with a story built around a fctitious organisation.\n\nNext to changing attitudes, the aim of studies that applied theory was also to change behaviours. For example, reinforcement learning theory was applied to increase repetition by reinforcing right answers (Chen et al. 2017). Although all theories we identifed in this review were useful in clarifying research fndings in the feld of gamifcation of education and learning, it remains difcult to explain on the basis of these theories why specifc game attributes or combinations of them should be preferred over others. For instance, Van Nuland et al. (2015) used social comparison theory to develop a digital, competition-based learning environment and explain research outcomes. Social comparison theory poses that individuals compare their performances to those of others to evaluate their abilities and seek self-enhancement (Gruder 1971; Wills 1981). Van Nuland et al. (2015) aimed to trigger social comparison in an intervention group by using leader boards with peer-to-peer competition in a tournament environment. They found that the intervention group outperformed their noncompeting peers on the second term test. Here, the use of social comparison theory helped clarify this efect through the comparative element underlying the competitive features of gamifed learning that may have increased participants’ motivation to excel. However, because scientifc theories are general statements describing or explaining causes or efects of phenomena, it remains unclear which specifc game element has the highest potential of triggering social comparison and whether competition should be the most viable option. Although the use of leader boards appears to be a valid choice, it can also hamper learning when it (1) shifts attention from learning to competition (see earlier), (2) is not liked by all students and (3) is not the only game attribute that triggers social comparison. Perhaps less competitive game elements (e.g., upgrading avatars, receiving badges, building things) or even diferent game attributes (e.g., control, game-fction or humaninteraction) could also trigger social comparison.",

Clarifcation studies could provide researchers with an understanding of the mechanisms that are involved in gamifed learning (and illuminate paths for future research) (Cook et al. 2008) and teachers with evidence-based information on how to implement gamifcation in a meaningful way. Based on our fndings, future clarifcation studies should use and validate existing learning theories in the context of gamifcation. The theories we identifed in this review could, among others, serve as a basis for this research (Landers 2014; Landers et al. 2015). Because theories are general ideas, researchers should focus on (separate) specifc game elements to identify the most promising game attributes in relation to a specifc theory. Important negative results should be reported as well. In addition, realist evaluation can help provide a deeper understanding by identifying what works for whom, in what circumstances, in what respects and how (Tilley and Pawson 2000). The fnding that (a combination of) game attributes may enhance learning outcomes by strengthening learning behaviours and attitudes towards learning could be used as a starting point for such an approach.\n\nIn addition, we would like to emphasize the need for design-based research using well-defned controlled groups to fnd out whether gamifed interventions work (justifcation research). Although justifcation research hardly allows for disentangling underlying processes, there should always be room for innovative ideas and interventions (e.g., applying infrequently used game attributes) to inform future research (Cook et al. 2008). Furthermore, design-based research on gamifcation can shed more light on learning outcomes. For instance, further research could illuminate whether increased repetition results in less positive learning outcomes when students’ attention is distracted from their learning task by one or more game attributes. We would also like to encourage design-based research for interventions that combine diferent outcome measures, such as learning outcomes and frequency of using gamifed educational interventions.\n\nFinally, most studies in this review showed promising results for implementing gamifcation in health professions education. This opens new ways for educators to carefully experiment with the way they teach and implement gamifed learning in their curricula. First, they need to determine whether there are behavioural or attitudinal problems that need attention and can be resolved by integrating game elements into the non-gaming learning environment. Subsequently, they have to determine which game attribute or combination of game attributes and matching game elements may help prevent consolidation of undesirable behaviours and/or attitudes. In this sense, gamifcation could be seen as an experimental educational tool to resolve behavioural or attitudinal problems towards learning which, therefore, may improve learning outcomes.",

The strengths of our systematic review are the comprehensive search strategy using multiple databases, the use of explicit in- and exclusion criteria and the transparent approach to collecting data. Furthermore, our study ofers a unique analysis approach implying a combination of four core elements—namely (a) an alternative way to distinguish gamifcation from other forms of game-based learning, (b) structuring game elements in a comprehensive way, (c) uncovering theories underpinning gamifed intervention and (d) assessing study quality—which sets our study apart from existing systematic reviews on gamifcation. Using such an approach, we were better able to make a distinction between the three forms of game-based learning (gamifcation, serious games and simulations) and, therefore, to make an accurate selection of gamifcation studies. In doing so, we added a new perspective to literature reviews in health professions education by applying a conceptual framework and using a more generic way of structuring individual game elements into overarching game attributes to investigate whether there is a (combination of) game attribute(s) that holds the highest promise of improving health professions education.\n\nThis study had several limitations. First, although we took a systematic approach to identifying relevant articles, it is possible that we unintentionally overlooked some articles that explored the same phenomenon using diferent keywords. We also may have missed some articles while we had to exclude keywords that were too general and resulted in too many irrelevant articles. Yet, we tried to include as many relevant articles as possible by basing our search on a list of 52 game elements and Lander’s framework (Landers 2014; Marczewski 2017). We kept our search as comprehensive as possible while critically evaluating the output. In addition, we did not set a timeframe for our search since individual game elements were used in a non-game context long before the term “gamifcation” was coined.\n\nSecond, we are aware that other scholars may have diferent views of what constitutes (serious) games or gamifed learning, since there is no consensus on the defnition of “game”’ and, therefore, “gamifcation” and “serious games” (Arjoranta 2014; Ramsey 1923; Salen and Zimmerman 2004; Suits 1978). Since we explicitly added “game-intention” to our defnitions of gamifcation, serious games and simulations, there may have been subjectivity in our decisionmaking process for inclusion/exclusion of studies. Views of designers, participating students, teachers and scholars can difer as to whether something is a game or not, because meanings are constructed on the basis of historical, cultural and social circumstances through specifc discourse of games or acts of gameplay. This means that even though designers, researchers and teachers may have the intention to not create a game and to only use game-elements, a participants’ view of whether it actually is a game can be quite diferent, depending on his or her background. For instance, some students or researchers may interpret the inclusion of a leader board as a game element in a non-gaming context, while others may interpret it as a game. So, although the intention of creating a game is the characteristic diference between gamifcation and serious games, the interpretation of gamifed interventions is prone to subjectivity due to a lack of consensus of what the word ‘game’ refers to. This, in turn, suggests that our study selection process may also be prone to subjectivity. However, the distinction we made between the three forms of game-based learning proved to be quite straightforward and we used a form of triangulation to overcome this limitation. Although we underline the need for clarifcation of terms like (serious) game and gamifcation, we do feel that our research method was appropriate for this study. A third limitation may be that only one researcher (AvG) was involved in screening the full texts to confrm the eligibility of each study on the basis of our in- and exclusion criteria. However, in case of uncertainties, the entire team was involved in the decision-making process and we undertook double screening on a $1 0 \\%$ random sample of the excluded articles as a form of triangulation. Additionally, all researchers independently reviewed full texts during the process and engaged in joint discussions to resolve uncertainties and reach consensus, when necessary. The fourth limitation is that we included mixed methods studies, but ranked the included studies using MERSQI only. MERSQI is an instrument for assessing the methodological quality of experimental, quasi-experimental and observational studies in medical education, so it does not assess the qualitative parts of mixed methods studies. Although using the MERSQI enabled comparison between all studies included in our study, we realize that our outcomes neglected the quality of the qualitative parts of these studies and may not refect the quality of each mixed-methods study in its entirety. We acknowledge, however, that the qualitative components of the mixed-methods studies may be very valuable. Fifth, although the applied conceptual framework enabled us to generalize our fndings, at times, generalization might have caused too much information loss since the framework could use more refnement. Sixth and fnally, we only included articles written in English and Dutch, so there is the potential for language and culture bias, since studies with positive results are more likely to be published in English-language journals (Egger et al. 1997).",

Satisfaction rates are generally high and positive changes in behaviour and learning have been reported. However, most of the included studies were descriptive in nature and rarely explained what was meant by gamifcation and how it worked in health professions education. Consequently, the current research status is too limited to provide educators with evidence-based recommendations on when and how specifc game elements should be applied. Future clarifcation research should explore theories that could explain positive or negative efects of gamifed interventions with welldefned control groups in a longitudinal way. In this way, we can build on existing theories and gain a practical and comprehensive understanding of how to select the right game elements for the right educational context and the right type of student.\n\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank Information Specialist Sjoukje van der Werf for her assistance in developing the search strategy.\n\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
