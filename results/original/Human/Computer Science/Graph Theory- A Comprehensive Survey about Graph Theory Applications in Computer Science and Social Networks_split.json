The unique applications of GT in the CS field such as clustering of web documents, cryptography, and analyzing an algorithm’s execution, among others, are promising applications. Furthermore, GT concepts can be employed to electronic circuit simplifications and analysis. Recently, graphs have been extensively used in social networks (SNs) for many purposes related to modelling and analysis of the SN structures, SN operation modelling, SN user analysis, and many other related aspects. Considering the widespread applications of GT in SNs, this article comprehensively summarizes GT use in the SNs. The goal of this survey paper is twofold. First, we briefly discuss the potential applications of GT in the CS field along with practical examples. Second, we explain the GT uses in the SNs with sufficient concepts and examples to demonstrate the significance of graphs in SN modeling and analysis.",

      "content": "The concept/origin of graph theory (GT) started with the Koinsber Bridge’s problem in 1735 for the first time in history [1]. With the help of the Koinsber Bridge’s problem, the concept of the Eulerian graph was derived. After that, Euler studied the concept of the Koinsber Bridge’s problem, and devised a new structure which was named the Eulerian Graph. Later, A.F Mobius gave the concept of two graphs i.e., complete graph and bipartite graph, in 1840 [2]. Kuratowski used both these graphs in some recreational problems and proved that both these graphs are planar in the recreational problems domain [3]. Gustav Kirchhoff gave the idea of tree structure without cycles in 1845 [4]. In addition, authors explained the GT concepts usage in calculating current in electrical circuits. In 1852, Thomas Gutherie introduced the four color problems which are extremely useful in today’s computer applications [5]. After that, in 1856, the Hamiltonian graph was invented by Thomas. P. Kirkman and Hamiltonian, and this type of graph has been extensively used in the literature [6–9]. The puzzle problem was introduced in 1913 by H. Dudeney using the prior concepts of the GT [10]. In 1878, James Joseph Sylvester introduced the word “Graphs” [11]. He used two concepts of algebra i.e., covariants and quantic invariants, and drew an analogy between them. Ramsey devised the concept of the external graph theory in 1941 by working on colorations [12]. Until then, GT concepts were adopted by a majority of scientists in their works. Recently, graphs are extensively used in many disciplines including social networks (SNs) modelling, big data analysis, natural language processing (NLP), complex network analysis, and patter recognition applications.",

      "content": "A number of studies have reported the graph theory applications in unique aspects of computer science and social networks. The unique aspects related to both these fields employing GT are cryptography [13], quantum cryptography [14], coding theory [15], construction of asymptotically shortest $\\mathbf { k }$ -radius sequences [16], privacy-preserving graph publication for informative analysis [17], studying the human brain anatomical network via graphs [18], landscape connectivity and conservation planning [19], image processing [20], information retrieval [21], social network analysis [22], signal processing via graphs [23], knowledge discovery in social networks [24], robotics [25], [26], network analysis of the world’s subway systems [27], semidefinite programming [28,29], image segmentation [30], clustering [31–35], data science [36–38], and pattern recognition [39]. These, among others, are the well-known graph theory unique applications. The seven most relevant surveys related to our work are: (1) Riaz et al. [40], (2) Shirinivas et al. [41], (3) DurgaPrasad et al. [42], (4) Liu et al. [43], (5) Qingbao Yu et al. [44], (6) Sporns et al. [45], and (7) Goyal et al. [46]. These studies have explained the GT applications in the field of computer science (CS). Meanwhile, the practical feasibility of the GT applications has not been comprehensively reported by these studies. In addition, there is no single survey that covers all practical applications of GT in both CS and SN domains, respectively.\n\nGraph theory techniques [47] are widely used in different disciplines including chemistry, biology, physics, and computer science [48–50]. GT is basically a mathematics concept with widespread applications in every discipline for modelling and analysis. In this paper, we briefly discuss the uses of GT in the field of CS and SNs [51–55]. We present different applications of graph theory in both these domains. Recently, many efforts have been devoted to developing complex software/environments/packages that can render the complex graph containing excessive amounts of data in a single window or an interface [56–58]. A comprehensive overview of the GT applications in the CS field is presented in Figure 1.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 1. Graph theory applications in the computer science field.\n\nA graph is a set of nodes and edges. The nodes are referred to as vertices/vertex, and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two/multiple nodes in a graph. A graph can be mathematically represented with $G$ . For example, in SNs a user’s graph is $G ( U , V )$ where $U$ is the list of users, and $V$ represents the set of edges showing the relationship between the users or items. The graphs are of two types: directed and undirected. In undirected graphs, the edges have no direction. An example of the undirected graph is shown in Figure 2a. For example, in Figure 2a depicted below, there is a relationship between $L$ and M, and this is the same thing as saying there is a relationship between $M$ and L. We can refer to the line between $M$ and $L$ as $( L {  } M )$ or $( \\mathrm { M } { \\gets } \\mathrm { L } )$ as it makes no difference in interpretation/understanding. The potential examples of the undirected graph are people and friendship in a SN or scientist and co-authored papers in a collaboration network. In contrast, in the directed graphs, the edges do have a particular direction (i.e., they can be regarded as incoming or outgoing). In these cases, the graphs are drawn with edges having arrowheads. The directed graphs are commonly known as digraphs. An example of directed graph is presented in Figure 2b. This might record the social relation “who likes whom” in a SN. Persons $A , B ,$ and $D$ all say they like person C. Note that person C does not say that he likes $A , B ,$ or $D$ . $B$ and $A$ like each other. Nobody says they like G. The example of directed graph is shown in Figure 2b. The potential applications of the directed graph are web pages and hyperlinks connections, Twitter follower graphs, interactions between users in a SN, and influence of one use on another user in SNs.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 2. Pictorial overview of the directed and undirected graphs.\n\nFurthermore, graphs can be classified into two additional categories: valued and non-valued. A valued graph has values (i.e., in the form of numbers) attached to the lines that represent the intensity or strength or quantity of the tie or frequency between the two nodes. The latter just represent the connection/relationship between nodes without any number. In SNs, the lines can represent the relationship (e.g., relative, friend, lover) between two users or the number of times a user $X$ interacted with user Y. An example of a valued graph is shown in Figure 3, where the edge weight represents the amount of trade, in trillions of dollars, between five different countries. The possible example of a non-valued graph can be the close border of some countries with each other without specifying the length of the borders.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 3. Example of a valued graph (i.e., edges have values).\n\nThere exist multiple types of the graphs that can be classified into several categories. Gartner [59] suggests the five broad categories of graphs based on their use, which are presented below.\n\n Social graph: This type of graph is about the connections between people/users. Examples of the social graph include Facebook, Twitter, and the idea of six degrees of separation.\n Intent graph: This type of graph deals with reasoning and motivation. For example, on Twitter, a user’s tweets can be analyzed, and intents are mined from the Twitter posts [60]. Later, the intent can be classified into six categories, namely food and drink, travel, career and education, goods\n\nand services, event and activities, and trifle.\n\nConsumption graph: The consumption graph is also known as the “payment graph”. It is mainly used in the retail industry. Many e-commerce companies such as eBay, Amazon, and Walmart use this type of graphs to track the consumption of their customers/subscribers. Examples of the consumption graph include credit risk analysis and chargebacks.\nInterest graph: Interest graphs models a user’s interests. It has been used for the organizing the web by interest rather than indexing only webpages.\nMobile graph: This type of graph is built from mobile data. The mobile data include browsing data from the web, smart applications, web applications, digital wallets, global positioning systems (GPS), and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.",

This not only makes the network easier, but it improves the frequency adjustment as per the user’s requirements. An example of the GSM architecture is given in Figure 7.

Here, our aim is to find a minimum vertex cover in the graph whose vertices can be used as routing servers and whose edges will be used to connect these routing servers with each other [64,65]. Then, a worm circulation solution should be found, and we can try to define a defense strategy for networks against worm circulation only on the relevant vertex. A graph $G$ which has a set of edges $E$ is said to cover $G$ if each vertex of $G$ occurs on at least one edge in e. An example of the G and vertex that can cover the graph fully is given in Figure 8.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 8.

The graphical representation of the MVC pattern makes it simple for the designers/developers to follow during actual development. An abstract view of the MVC design pattern is depicted in Figure 11a, where the nodes are the module of the MVC, and edges represent the interaction and data/control flow in a web application. In addition, the service-use flow can be modelled via graphs with sufficient details (as shown in Figure 11b). For example, the user request can be gathered at the controllers which makes the application error-free.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 11. Model, view, and controller (MVC) development architecture: overview and information flow modelling via graphs.\n\nWith graphs, the applications testing can become easy and robust. Furthermore, the information flow can be monitored easily. In some cases, it can be used to organize the complete files via graphs for each distinct language used in an application. A generic overview of graphs used to represent the main modules and related files of each scripting language are shown in Figure 12.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 12. The use of graphs in organizing distinct category files used in a web application.\n\nIn Figure 12, the language names are the vertex and files are attributes (files) of each language. With the help of the above concepts, one can organize all related files used in a web application for simplicity. Graphs can also be used in analyzing the website use trends and user visits frequency.",

Web documents clustering is a process of organizing similar types of web documents together in a same class [68,69] or server. To optimize the query and appropriate information retrieval, it is desirable to keep similar types of web documents in one cluster [70]. Clustering is widely used in information retrieval processes [71–73] and web document collections [74]. The concept of web document clustering is shown in Figure 13.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 13. Conceptual overview of web documents clustering.\n\n$k$ -means clustering algorithm is an exclusive clustering algorithm in which each data item is related to only one cluster. In the $k$ -mean clustering algorithm, each cluster is represented by the center of the cluster called the mean point. $k \\mathrm { \\cdot }$ -mean algorithm can be implemented in four steps: (1) make the partition of the different documents into $k$ non-empty subsets, (2) compute the mean point of each cluster, also known as seed point or centroid, (3) associate each document with its nearest cluster seed point, and (4) go back to step 2; stop when there are no more documents remaining separate from a cluster. An example of $k \\mathrm { \\cdot }$ -mean clustering working is given in Figure 14.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 14. The formulation of different coloring options used in $k$ -mean clustering algorithm.\n\n$k$ -mean clustering has variety of applications in each sector. The potential five applications of $k$ - mean clustering are given as: (1) modelling customer characteristics for target marketing and campaigns, (2) customer need and preferences segmentation, (3) image compression for reducing the space complexity in computer vision applications, (4) network security monitoring, and (5) SNA and mining, etc. Another clustering method is a median graph which is an undirected graph used for clustering in which there are any three vertices let’s say $x , y ,$ and $z$ . These three vertices have a unique median. In this undirected graph, the median is a vertex $( x , y , z )$ that is related to the shortest path between any two vertices of $x , y ,$ and $z$ . A median graph of three vertices is shown in Figure 15.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 15. The median of three vertices in a median graph.\n\nPresenting web documents in the form of graphs has two benefits: (1) it uses the inherit structure of original web documents instead of using vectors that include its frequencies, and (2) it is not necessary to develop a new clustering algorithm from scratch for everything. An example of graphical representation of web documents is shown in Figure 16. The entities are the vertices of the graphs and linking between them is shown on the edges.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 16.

A pictorial overview of WSN as a Voronoi graph is shown in Figure 17. In Figure 17, alphabets $a \\mathrm { - } p$ represent the sensor’s deployment location, and regions that are modelled with cells represent the coverage range of the sensors.

A pictorial overview of a WSN as a graph is shown in Figure 18a. The nodes are the sensors and edges are the links between nodes. Each sensor is used for monitoring and recording the physical measures of the dedicated environment and retaining the collected data from a specific location S shown with a square in Figure 18a. There is one source which collects data from all sensor nodes. Some nodes from the network behave as relays for data forwarding to the sink. In addition, GT can be used to model the load balancing to maximize the WSN lifetime and real-time data collection from nodes [76].

In graphs, proper coloring is used for the vertices and edges where no two vertices/ edges should have the same color. This type of graph is called a colored graph, and the minimum number of colors used in a graph is known as the chromatic number.

      "content": "Graphs can be used in job-scheduling and flight-scheduling problems. Another example of a scheduling problem is bi-processor tasks, for example when there are many processors and multiple tasks to be executed. Each task should be executed by any two processors simultaneously, and we should pre-allocate these two processors to the tasks. A processor will work only on one task at a time, and it cannot execute multiple tasks simultaneously. Another example is a professor’s meeting with multiple students in a lab that can be modelled using a graph. For example, the students who have a meeting at the same time can be clustered in a group. The remaining students can be represented as a graph. Transfer of files among the processors can be applicable in this type of problem. Applying this scenario on the graph’s processors will be presented as vertices of graph and if there are any two processors which will work on the same job, they will be connected using edges. Later, we can use the coloring techniques in such a way that each color must appear only on one vertex. We have shown a graph which represents the above scenario in Figure 20.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 20. Processors having different tasks in a simultaneous fashion.\n\nThe above graph is showing that task1 is allocated to the processors $( P \\boldsymbol { 1 } , P 5 )$ , task2 is allocated to processors $( P 1 , \\ P 6 )$ , task3 is allocated to the processors $( P 2 , \\ P 4 )$ and task4 is allocated to the processors $( P 3 , P 7 )$ . We can use the precoloring technique where allocation of jobs is predefined. Here, some of the vertices of the graph will be pre-colored. List coloring is another technique which is used in graph coloring where there is a list of colors available and we have to find a suitable color from the available list of colors for each vertex. Timetable-scheduling problems can also be solved with the help of bipartite graphs. A bipartite graph is a type of graph where vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets of $V$ and $U$ . Each edge connects a vertex in $U$ to one in $V$ .\n\nSuppose there are $m$ number of professors with $n$ number of subjects and $p$ number of periods should be arranged. We should present $m$ number of professors and $n$ number of subjects as the vertices of the graph and these vertices will be connected with p number of edges where $\\mathrm { P }$ represents periods. We predefined that each processor can teach one subject at any one period. A maximum of one processor should be taught one subject. The solution of this timetabling problem can be obtained by dividing the edges of the graph $G$ by the minimum number of its matches. Also, we can color the edges of a graph. Requirements of teaching with four professors (i.e., $M _ { 1 } { \\sim } M _ { 4 }$ ) and five subjects $( N _ { 1 } { \\sim } N _ { 5 } )$ are summarized in Table 2, the corresponding bipartite graph is given in Figure 21.\n\nTable 2.

Analytics firms are heavily relying the SN user data for analyzing social trends, user attitudes towards latest brands, intent mining, sentiment analysis, and personality analysis [98]. The related concepts, applications, uses, and technological advancements of SN are comprehensively explained in studies [99–103]. SNs are complex networks and can be represented by a graph $G ( U , V ) ,$ , where $U$ is the list of SN users or entities, and V represents the set of edges showing the relationship between the users or items. The relationship might be the friendship/lover/family member/sibling on a Facebook. A typical overview of the SN users in the form of a graph is shown in Figure 22. The vertices are users, and edges represent the relationship between the users. The edges can be directed or undirected and are used to represent the similarity, trust, communication cost, interactions frequency, and influence between users in a SN.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 22. Social network (SN) users modelled as a graph G.\n\nThe SN users’ graph can be either vertex labeled, or edge labelled. The vertices are mainly users (i.e., containing users names or user id) and edges are the relationship (relation, trust, similarity, and/or association) between them. The links can be directed or undirected depending on the problem. The example of a labeled-vertex graph is shown in Figure 23a. The node labels are the users’ names and edges are the relationship (i.e., friendship) between users. The example of a labeled-edges graph is shown in Figure 23b.

It can also be thought of as a form of text mining/processing, or a way to obtain frequently occurring patterns of words in a textual material. Many studies have been proposed for the topic modelling including information-based, content-based, activity-based, and/or aspect-based topic modelling [129–131].\n\nIn a micro-blog scenario/application, the noun entities play an important role in language understanding, interpretation, and content generation, which efficiently reflects personal interest knowledge.

There are endless choices for each item such as movies, songs, purchasing items, friends in a SN, and books. Hence, we need a system to filter out most of this content and give suggestions to a user about the relevant content only [135]. Recommendation systems are designed to solve this problem, and to give consumers/users a best suggestion based on existing data, historical data, and user preferences. Recommendation systems are widely used in e-commerce sites, SN service delivery, healthcare, government sectors, and academia. For example, Netflix suggests movies, Facebook suggests friends based on similarities (i.e., demographic, spatial, temporal, interest, and relationships) and interests, Amazon suggests products, Google Scholar recommends relevant articles based on the area of expertise of researchers, and music applications such as iTunes, YouTube, and Spotify suggest next songs that the user may like to hear based on the current song a user is listening to. It can even be applied to other domains such as social networking micro-blogs, information spread, rumor control, cyber aggression, and hate speech. Facebook uses it for suggesting friends, posts, and events. GT can play a vital role to model the association between users and items of their interest. For example, to model the association between users and movies, the nodes can be the customer/movie and edges will represent whether a particular user has watched a movie or not. We present an example of the bipartite graph to show the usage of graphs in a recommendation system. The information about three customers and four movies is depicted in Table 4.\n\nTable 4. Relevant information about the customers and movies.\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Customer/Movie</td><td>Movie 1</td><td>Movie 2</td><td>Movie 3</td><td>Movie 4</td></tr><tr><td>Customer 1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Customer 2</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Customer 3</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nIn Table 4, the zeros represent whether a customer has watched a particular movie or not.

The equivalent bipartite graph obtained from the data given in Table 4 is shown in Figure 37. The actual dataset of the users has a total of 9123 movies and 671 users. Therefore, the bipartite graph matrix has a size of $( 9 1 2 3 \\times 6 7 1 )$ ). The association between the movies and users can be easily modelled using a bipartite graph. The recommendation about relevant movies/songs can be done by the content analysis and collaborative filtering [136].\n\n[Image]\nFigure 37.

      "content": "Tremendous amounts of data are being generated/collected by organizations like hospitals, banks, e-commerce, and retail and supply chains from their users/consumers/subscribers. Just like traditional organizations, SNs such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube also collect an excessive amount of data about their users. On the one hand, releasing stored data is beneficial for data mining firms. On the other hand, releasing data may violate the users’ privacy. In this work, we discuss the privacy-preserving SN data publishing in a structural (i.e., graph) form. Related studies which publish the SN user’s data by perturbing graph structure can be found in the literature [139–143]. The SN data is in a structural form and is perturbed before publishing with the analytics firm for analysis. In the literature, there exist plenty of techniques which modify the graph structure by either nodes/vertex [144], edges/connections [145], and/or both [146]. For decreasing the attacker’s knowledge to re-identify the individuals, the degree concept is employed on graph structure. An example of the 4-degree and 2-degree (i.e., $k = 2 , 4$ ) anonymous graph is shown in Figure 39. The purpose of imposing the degree constraint is to hide the user in the crowd of $k$ other users to protect his/her private information privacy.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 39. An example of 2- and 4-degree anonymous graph (Ref. [147]).\n\nFigure 39 illustrates 2-degree anonymous graphs. In Figure 39a all four nodes have the same degree, which is 2, so the graph is 4-degree anonymous. In Figure 39b two nodes have degree 3 and four nodes have degree 2, so the graph is 2-degree anonymous. In every $k$ -degree anonymous graph, for every node $v$ belonging $V$ there exist at least $k { - } 1$ other nodes that have the same degree as of $v$ [147]. A general example of the naïve anonymization of the SN data is shown in Figure 40. Here the user’s direct identities (i.e., names, SSN, cell phone numbers, and emails) are removed from the anonymous graph.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 40. Example of the social network anonymization given in the form of a graph.\n\nRecently, due to the widespread adoption of SNs around the globe, many efforts have been devoted to anonymous SN user data publishing by perturbing the graph structures [148,149]. In the following two examples, we present the anonymization of the graph by adding a new vertex and edges, respectively. The purpose to perturb the graph structure is to increase uncertainty for the intruders. An example of the 3-degree anonymous graph by adding edges is shown in Figure 41a. In Figure 41a, the edges with red color are the newly added edges to increase uncertainty. By adding the new edges, the utility of the original graphs decreases but the privacy guarantee increases due to more uncertainty. The decision about the vertex addition or edges addition is made on the basis of the published data on consumers, target application, and nature of the data. An example of the anonymization by adding the vertices/nodes is shown in Figure 41b. The marked vertices are the newly added vertices. By adding the new edges and vertices, the information preservation/revelation degree can be adjusted accordingly.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 41. An example of the SN users graph anonymization by adding edges and vertices.\n\nIn some cases, the relational anonymization techniques are applied to the graph structure to preserve user privacy in publishing SN data [150,151]. An example of the l-diverse and $k \\mathrm { \\cdot }$ -anonymous graph is shown in Figure 42. Such concepts were used for the tabular data anonymization but due to the widespread uses of the SN data, such concepts have been increasingly employed on the SN data. However, these concepts are combined with some structural modifications to produce the anonymous graph from the original graph. Meanwhile, due to the conceptual simplicity of the $l .$ - diversity and $k$ -anonymity privacy models, both these models have been extensively used in relational and graph data anonymization. These models significantly preserve the user’s privacy in data publishing with analysts/researchers without significantly degrading data usefulness.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 42. Example of the $l .$ -diverse and $k \\mathrm { . }$ -anonymous graph (where both $k = 2$ and $l = 2$ ).\n\nThe l-diversity model/concept states that for every equivalence group based on $k$ -value, there should be at least l distinct sensitive attribute labels. In Figure 42, we illustrate how an original graph can be modified to satisfy 2-degree anonymity and 2-diversity property i.e., for every node (i.e., user in real-world), there exists at least l other nodes having the same degree and for very equivalence group, at least 2 different sensitive labels are present to decrease the sensitive attribute disclosure. In Figure 42, S1, S2, etc., show the sensitive label of a different type (for example if the sensitive attribute is salary, then S1 value can be ${ > } 5 0 \\mathrm { K }$ and $\\mathsf { S } _ { 2 }$ value can be $\\le 5 0 \\mathrm { K }$ dollars etc.).",

By comparing the expanse of communication patterns among intra- and inter-communities, authors show that it is possible to detect several types of events, even when they do not trigger a significantly larger communication among users. A schematic representation of the proposed event detection method taken from the Moriano et al. [152] study is shown in Figure 43.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 43.

In Figure 43a, when there is no event, most of the communication takes place within communities only. In Figure 43b, when a global event occurs, more communication takes place among the communities because of the global relevance and the virality of the specific event.

In WSN, graphs can be used to represent the topology of node deployment, order of the values/data collection, faulty and non-faulty components representation, and sensing co-ordination and controls. In IoT domain, graphs can be used for information diffusion, data collection, flow analysis, monitoring of attacks, risk assessment, information retrieval, and collaboration among devices. In the blockchain domain, graphs can be used to represent the p2p network users, links between peers, peer communication analysis, peer interaction patterns, and peer status analysis. In computer vision, the graphs are used to perform the image analysis, corner detections, histogram representations, and linkages between moving objects.\n\nSNA applications include marketing as well as risk and fraud detection. Marketing applications are customer buying patterns prediction and announcing the marketing campaigns. Since user group characteristics can impact buying rates/behaviors, firms may be able to guess and estimate sales using SNA to better understand group behavior and thereby individual behavior. Similarly, by identifying influencers (e.g., influential spreaders, opinion leaders) within groups, firms can launch marketing campaigns. The influence of a group member makes other members more likely to purchase the offering or change their opinion. On the risk and fraud detection front, SNA can be employed to detect money misuse and fraud involving credit cards (using people-buyer patterns or activities over websites). Applying SNA to online customer data created through online activities among students and faculty may allow us to understand which types of online activities are most beneficial for elearning. GT can be used in SN security and privacy analysis. In addition, GT can be used in all SNArelated problems (see Figure 48).\n\nAside from the numerous applications of GT in CS and SN, the users/developer of GT face several challenges while processing complex graphs. We summarize a few unique technical challenges discussed by Sahu et al. [158]. The technical challenges related to graphs are presented in Figure 49 in brief.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 49. Technical challenges with the graph’s handling/processing.\n\nA brief discussion of each technical challenge listed in Figure 49 is explained below.\n\nVariety of entities: Generally, graphs represent a very wide variety of entities. However, many of them are not naturally distinguished to be used as vertices or edges. Interestingly, traditional companies collected data comprised of products, quotes, orders, and transactions, which are stored easily in the relational systems. Meanwhile, the graph rendering, and representation is not straightforward. Hence, it demands a flexible storage and retrieval system in graphical form.  Ubiquity: In many real-world problems, the size of graphs can be very large, often containing over a billion/trillion number of edges and nodes. These large graphs represent the entities and relationships between them. Therefore, their handling and processing is a big challenge. Organizations such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter are facing such problems. Scalability: The capability to process very large graphs containing many users’ data efficiently is very challenging. Rendering of the large graphs needs extensive computing power and storage. Data visualization: Visualization is an important task in participants’ graph processing. After scalability, the graph developers/users need appropriate visualization as their second most pressing challenge. The visualization of the large dataset containing many entities is extremely complex and selecting appropriate visualization is very challenging. Prevalence of relational database management systems (RDBMs): In the presence of RDBMS, sometimes it becomes difficult to choose the task modelling between relational and structural.\n\nA number of technical challenges reported by Nadya et al. [159] have also been extensively studied in the recent past. According to the authors, the technical challenges related to the graph are:\n\nFew trusted datasets of relevant scales exist that allow for rigorous evaluation of detection techniques on the graph data. The description of the backgrounds (normal patterns and noise) and foregrounds (target and anomalous patterns) are still being formalized. Relationships of interest to many applications are highly dynamic. Dealing with large-scale dynamic graphs is an emerging research area, and significant efforts are needed to deal with such large-scale graphs. In practice, many graphs can be made from a given dataset. However, determining what the graph’s representation will be the most effective for a particular task is a highly complex task. In some real-world problems, it is necessary to quickly generate multiple different graphs from the same dataset or from multiple datasets. Meanwhile, storage, representation, and data-access techniques are often hard-coded, making this a difficult, error-prone, and time-consuming task. Many graph algorithms have high computational complexity. Also, the complexity increases exponentially with the increase in number of entities. Many factors contribute to this inefficiency, for example, sparsity of data and poor data locality of operations. The detection theory concept for graphs is a new area of research, and for the most settings, the performance bounds have not been explored well. Furthermore, for most datasets related to networks, there is no fine-grained manner to specify what type of patterns will be explored (i.e., be detectable), and what type of patterns will be subsumed in the noise.\n\nThe technical challenges summarized above need significant attention from developers and researchers. In addition, there is an emerging need of the databases which can store the graphs. There exist some databases like Neo4j, but the scalability of such tools is not suited to large-scale applications involving multiple entities data such as Facebook user data. In addition, the graph rendering software does not scale well with the size of the graph. Thus, development of the tools, software, and libraries that can process large-scale graphs efficiently has become imperative.",

      "content": "In this paper, we have presented a review of the works carried out in the field of computer science (CS) and social networks (SN) which employs the concepts of graph theory (GT). The contribution can assist many researchers from various perspectives by analyzing graph properties and choosing the right combination of the graphs according to their problem. The well-summarized potential applications of GT can assist beginner researchers to grasp its concepts and existing use in many diverse applications of CS and SN domains. In addition, we provided practical examples and explanations of the potential use of GT to emphasize the importance of graphs in modern research. Apart from the novel applications of the graphs in CS and SN such as modelling of the network security breaches, modelling user interactions with e-commerce sites, network topology modelling, scheduling-related problems, network routing analysis, operating environment modelling in robotics for pathfinding, network traffic flow analysis, effective representation of wireless sensor networks, SN user’s interaction/relationship modelling, topic of interest modelling, user’s community clustering/detection, information diffusion, opinion leader detection, user behavior analysis, privacypreserving user data publishing, cybercrime detection, and influence/trust modeling, graphs can be used in modelling vehicular networks and provision of digital signage (i.e., digital contents) on the roads. Graphs can also be used for a vehicle’s mobility analysis, audio/video content dissemination, vehicle-to-vehicle routing, capturing information about traffic flow, and/or for safety indications on the roads. In addition, they can be applied to assist in executing traffic management and routing plans. In the future, it will be imperative to devise new graphical tools and applications for the vehicular network management due to the emergence of smart cities.\n\nIn the future, we plan to extend the results in describing the uses of the GT in specific sectors such as healthcare, green energy environment, smart home environment, advanced SN user analysis, federated learning, and other related areas. In addition, we intend to investigate the GT potential applications in other disciplines of science including chemistry, biology, and physics. The intent analysis [160] by fusing multiple graphs data and analysis, is a promising area to be explored further leveraging the graphs. Finally, we intend to explore the usage of GT in data science, which has become a very popular area of research in recent years.",
