A foundational resource for contemporary social science, the data it produces and disseminates enable social scientists to develop broad and deep understandings into the changing fabric of US society, and aid legions of instructors and students in teaching and learning. It facilitates internationally comparative survey research and places the United States in the context of other societies through the International Social Survey Program, which it cofounded. This article first recounts the GSS's origins, design,and development. It then surveys contributions based on GSS data to studies of stratification and inequality, religion, sociopolitical trends, intergroup relations, social capital and social networks, health and well-being, culture, and methodology.",

      "content": "GSS founderJames A.Davis's proposal to the National Science Foundation(\"Twenty-Some Questions: A National Data Program for Sociology\") led to the first (1972) GSS.Writing when data were scarce and closely held,Davis stressed widespread and timely dissemination of a modest body of high-quality survey data to facilitate research, replication,and teaching. He argued for measuring 25 background characteristics (e.g., education, race, marital status) and 9 atitude/opinion items (on, e.g., race relations, happiness,and interpersonal trust),advocating that measurements come from prior national surveys so that trends could be assessed immediately. He proposed that they be included in an ongoing national survey also covering other topics.Early GSSs included many more items than those 34,and by 1977 the GSS became a stand-alone survey.\n\nAspirations Davis articulated—to monitor trends and widely distribute data—remain among the GSS's primary objectives. Success in dissemination depends on engaging the interest and initiative of practicing social scientists; the review below demonstrates that this has been amply forthcoming.\n\nTo pursue these goals, the GSS follows a repeated cross-sectional design,optimal for assessing aggregate over-time change in a population. Each GSS round draws a fresh representative sample of noninstitutionalized US adults; in-person interviews (including some self-administered segments) are its preferred data collection mode. Only English-speaking Americans were represented until 2006, when Spanish speakers were added. Conducted almost annuall until 1993 and biennially (with larger samples) since 1994,it tracks trends by replicating the wording of a“core\" set of items verbatim over time.Pooling data across adjacent-in-time cross sections yields appreciably sized samples of proportionately small groups (e.g.,Asian Americans,sexual minorities); several such samples can be compared across periods to assess subgroup trends.\n\nTo augment this design,in 1977 the project added single-occasion topical modules that examine new subjects (e.g., social networks) or investigate existing ones (e.g., race relations) in greater depth.These introduce innovation alongside the continuity provided by the repeated core items, leading to significant cross-sectional studies. Many items subsequently added to the replicating core first appeared within topical modules.\n\nFollowing early-198Os bilateral German-American collaboration,the GSS—together with several overseas survey organizations—established the International Social Survey Program (ISSP). ISSP annually develops a collaboratively designed module (about,e.g.,social inequality or the environment) administered since 1985 in the GSS and similar surveys elsewhere.This added a third aim to the project: placing the United States in the context of other societies via comparative survey research.\n\nAdditionally, the GSS regularly conducts survey experiments addressing both substantive and methodological questions.Between 2O06 and 2014,it incorporated a panel component that reinterviewed respondents two and four years after they were first sampled.Several auxiliary studies of groups linked to GSS respondents—including work establishments (Kalleberg et al.1996) and religious congregations (Chaves 2O04)—branch out of the GSS.\n\nAmong the GSS's most valuable assets is the range of attitude and behavior data it collects, together with its wide and deep body of background information; it obtains extensive descriptions of the current social positions and social origins of its respondents,and of spouses/partners for those who are married/cohabiting.Increasingly it links respondent-provided survey data with other individual- and contextual-level (e.g.,residential area) information from sources like voter registration records and the US Census.Many paradata documenting the data collection process are available.The GSS takes great care to ensure the over-time comparability of measures for trend analyses. It assgns high priority to survey quality, maintaining response rates far above the survey industry standard, closely monitoring field efforts,and implementing numerous qualitycontrol measures.",

      "content": "Several studies assess trends in numerous GSS measures to generalize about directions of US opinion change. Combining GSS with other data dating from the late 193Os,Smith (1990b) found that liberally-oriented changes—especially regarding equal rights and individual choicepredominated. Exceptions included conservative trends on crime,spending/taxation,and social welfare.Many liberal trends moderated or reversed in the 1970s.Davis (1992) reported similar findings for 42 GSS series spanning 1972-1989,asserting that the 1980s saw a“liberal rebound,” and later (Davis 2013) extended this conclusion through 2010.Fischer & Hout (2006),too, concluded that liberalization was more common.\n\nHout (2020) recently examined 276 GSS items,almost all of which exhibit some change over all or part of the 1972-2018 time span. We discuss many of these in more depth below; among the largest are declines in newspaper reading,racial intolerance,disapproval of homosexuality, and opposition to legalized marijuana. Change was rarely uniform in either direction or pace, but more often toward liberal than conservative positions.\n\nMany items tracked by the GSS are not readily arrayed along a conservative-liberal continuum. Studies collected by Marsden (2O12) examine trends in numerous orientations and behaviors, including sociopolitical atitudes as wellas informal socializing,institutional confidence,religiosity, subjective well-being,and verbal achievement.\n\nGenerally speaking,analyses of the GSS reveal most social change to be gradual rather than abrupt. Cohort turnover—the replacement of earlier-born, usually older, persons by more recently-born younger ones (Firebaugh 1989)—contributes notably to many trends.Davis (2013) suggested that liberalizing tendencies linked to cohort replacement have slowed,largely because cohort-related increases in education became smaller. The competing process of intracohort, within-person change—due to aging and period diferences combined—can counter cohort replacement, dampening the overall pace of change. Job satisfaction, for example,remains largely level overall: Fals due to cohort replacement are balanced by intracohort increases (Firebaugh & Harley 1995). The two processes may reinforce one another, however,leading to relatively rapid change at the population level; examples include orientations toward homosexuality (Baunach 2011)and views about legalizing marijuana (Felson et al.2019).",

      "content": "Beyond the general direction of attitude trends is the question of whether groups of Americans are increasingly separated from and in contention with one another.DiMaggio et al. (1996) examine this using 1974-1994 GSS data on social issues,defining polarization multidimensionally to include rising variability and bimodality in orientations,and increased between-group differences in average atitudes.They report litle evidence of polarization, exceptions being abortion rights and differences between Democratic and Republican identifiers. Evans's (2O03) replication over a longer time period yielded further signs of polarization—around issues of both sexual morality and abortion rights-and more widespread evidence of widening partisan differences (see also Manza et al.2012).Bolzendahl & Brooks (2005) report similar findings about growing differences by religious afiliation in attitudes about premarital sex and abortion rights.Fischer & Hout (2006) outline a diffusion model for atitude change,under which innovator (e.g., younger, more educated,or urban) groups lead the adoption of new views (on, e.g. gender role attitudes), but intergroup diferences subsequently shrink as a consensus is reached. This process need not be one-directional,as contention over abortion rights illustrate.\n\nMiller & Hoffmann (1999) suggest that separation may be based more on identities than particular issues, showing that between 1975 and 1996 adherents of conservative religious groups increasingly labeled themselves as political conservatives. Chaves (2O17) reports a growing association between church attendance and political, social,and religious conservatism through 2014. Manza et al. (2O12) document a rising tendency for self-labeled conservatives to identify as Republicans,together with widening diferences between parties on certain social issues.The review below identifies additional instances of polarization,especially by political afiliation.\n\nMost research based on the GSS focuses on particular substantive domains.In what follows, we selectively call attention to contributions in several fields of central interest within sociology. We amplify some points using tabulations we obtained via the online analysis tools in https:// sda.berkeley.edu,one of many sites that disseminate GSS data (among other widely used social science databases).",

Weeden & Grusky (2012),for example,show that attitudes are decreasingly associated with “big-class”differences (e.g.，between professionals and laborers), while those linked to smaller occupational “microclasses”(e.g., accountants,cosmetologists, lawyers) are stable.

Torche (2011) reexamined this finding for 1996-2006,replicating it in many respects but also reporting the emergence of an intergenerational association among advanced degree holders. She therefore questions universalistic/meritocratic interpretations of mobility trends within educational elites.Studying 1972-2012 GSS data,Pfeffer & Hertel (2015)found rising social fluidity, as the number of college-educated persons subject to weaker regimes of status inheritance grew. Beller (2oo9)questions the conventional practice of using only paternal characteristics to measure social origins. After incorporating maternal data, she reports a higher intergenerational association for 1994-2006; failing to do so obscured a rise in socioeconomic ascription among men born after 1965.Hout's (2018) study of the 1994-2016 period revealed continued intergenerational persistence in occupational standing; coupled with reductions in mobility due to occupational transformation,this implies lowered upward mobility for post-1960s birth cohorts.\n\nGrusky & DiPrete (1990) examine variation in status attainment processes over the 1972-1987 period.Race differences in occupational attainment fel,as did those by gender-the latter reflecting deterioration among men more than improvements for women.Poorly educated workers fared least well.These reductions in ascription were greater in the 197Os; the authors associate this with the more conservative political agenda of the 1980s (DiPrete & Grusky 1990).",

Since 1972,roughly half of GSS interviewees identified themselves as lower or working class,and half as middle or upper class.The split rises and falls over time: A rise in lower/workingclass identification followed the Great Recesson that began in 2Oo8,and the lower-class fraction (about $8 \\%$ in 2018) is yet to revert. Higher objective attainments predict middle/upper-class identification: Education and income receive greater weight than occupational standing. Selfemployed persons and those exercising authority over others tend to place themselves in the middle/upper class (Vanneman & Cannon 1987).\n\nIdentification with higher classes is less common among blacks than whites (Vanneman & Cannon 1987).Hunt & Ray's (2012) trend study through 2010 found that middle-class identification among blacks rose, in keeping with objective gains.Self-employment emerged as a predictor of middle-class identification by blacks in the 199Os and 2000s.\n\nInvestigations of gender differences in class identification highlight processes within couples, capitalizing on the GSS's spousal data. Davis & Robinson (1988) reported that identification by married women rested largely on their husbands’ characteristics in the 197Os but moved toward according equal emphasis to their own atributes in the 198Os; men relied mainly on their own attributes when placing themselves. Yamaguchi & Wang (2oo2) found that class placements by spouses in dual-earner couples weight their earnings in the same way and emphasize the husband's rather than the wife's occupation.Men take only their own education into account, while selfemployed women are especially apt to stress their own attributes rather than their husbands'.",

Indeed,preferences for reducing income inequality rise when it is perceived to rest on unfair grounds (e.g.,social connections or origins) or to be opportunity-limiting.\n\nSvalfors (1997) drew on ISSP data to compare US attitudes toward income redistribution with those in seven high-income countries, finding Americans least likely to regard equalizing incomes or a guaranteed basic income as governmental responsibilities. US respondents regarded a larger extent of income dispersion across occupations as legitimate than did those elsewhere.Another ISSP-based study (Osberg & Smeeding 2Oo6) found that Americans,on average,were neither especially more likely nor unlikely than people elsewhere to regard income differences as too high. Distinctive,however, is that US perceptions of the correspondence between actual and equitable earned incomes are divided: A notable—and evidently growing-group views existing diferences as justified,while another favors substantial compression of inequalities. Greater consensus on the desirability of some reduction exists in other countries.",

They suggest that much of the rise in nonafiliation has political roots,maintaining that political moderates and liberals distance themselves from the association of organized religion with conservative politics by claiming to have no religion.",

(2O12) extend this using GSS data through 2Oo8. Many findings pertain to white Americans only, who widely and increasingly endorse principles of equal treatment in, for example, marriage,education,and employment; African Americans generally hold notably more prointegration views.\n\nImplementation of these principles is a different matter. Among whites, Bobo et al. (2012) report low, slightly declining support for government policy that would improve black living standards; beliefs that there should be no“special favors”were much more prevalent. They highlight resistance to special treatment for blacks as a cornerstone of “racial resentment,”a “laissez-faire” orientation to racial isues. Opposition to preferential hiring ofblacks is high (above $8 0 \\%$ among whites,and substantial (over $5 0 \\%$ ）among blacks.Bobo & Kluegel (1993) show that both racetargeting (especiall) and focusing on equalizing outcomes rather than opportunities reduce white support for policy interventions.\n\nKey to understanding many racial atitudes are beliefs about sources of black-white inequalities; those holding structurally oriented views tend toward more liberal stances than those with more individualistic understandings.Whites are most apt to attribute racial differences to individual motivational deficits, while blacks are inclined toward structural accounts involving discrimination or limited opportunity; some rise in motivational explanations among blacks is evident, however (Bobo et al.2012).Hunt (2007) found that Hispanic beliefs about bases of black-white inequality lie between those held by blacks and non-Hispanic whites.\n\nAmong notable predictors (other than race/ethnicity) of racial attitudes are age,cohort, education, gender,region,and religious beliefs (Hunt 20o7, Schuman et al.1997). Of these, education has drawn particular attention, partly because it is thought to promote generally more tolerant views (Bobo & Licari 1989).More education is linked with support for principles of equality, holding structural rather than individualistic inequality beliefs,and less stereotyping.Its relationship to policy implementation is weaker and less consistent (Schuman et al.1997). Wodtke (2012) suggests that education differences may reflect “ideological refinement”rather than “enlightenment.”\n\nWith the increasingly diverse racial/ethnic composition of the United States have come more analyses involving groups other than blacks and non-Hispanic whites,as both holders and objects of attitudes. Examples include Hunt's (2oo7) findings on inequality beliefs among Hispanics,and Wodtke's (2O12) analysis suggesting that education may not encourage rejection of stereotypes among Asians. Invoking both threat and contact theories,Dixon (2O06) finds that whites who live in places with higher fractions of blacks are more prone to negatively stereotype blacks—but less apt to do the same for Asians when situated near many Asians. Apart from these contextual variations,stereotyping is lower among those who have personal contacts within any given minority group.Xu & Lee (2013) show that many positive characteristics are ascribed to Asians,while Hispanics are negatively stereotyped in several respects. Both Asians and Hispanics continue to be seen as outsiders,regarded as,for example,less patriotic than persons in other race/ethnic groups.",

Cotter et al.

Overall,Schnitker (2O07) reports a slight downward trend in SRH.This is positive among women,however, primarily by virtue of rising education. Women typically report lower SRH than men,but this gap has narrowed due to rising female labor force participation.Warren & Hernandez (2o07) find no change in the well-established socioeconomic gradient over time,though recent cohorts say thatthey have beter SRH.Schnittker (2004) reports a stronger positive association between education and SRH among those having lower incomes. Zheng's (2Oo9) analysis found that the likelihood of reporting poor health rose significantly with higher income inequality.\n\nAnalysis of 2011-2012 ISSP data (Hero et al.2017) revealed that income differences in reporting fair or poor SRH were larger in the United States than in almost allthe other 31 highand middle-income countries studied, excepting only Chile and Portugal.

Willingness to support coercion into treatment was widespread.A further replication ten years later (Pescosolido etal.2O10) found that understanding of schizophrenia, major depression,and alcohol dependence in neurobiological terms rose—as did support for seeking treatment—but stigma did not decline.",

Overall happiness levels stayed largely stable from 1972 to 2018,though a very slight downward trend is detectable.Hout (2016) links this to rising income inequality, reporting largely stable happiness among the well-of, but a decline among the less affluent—especially in the wake of the Great Recession. Yang's (20o8) age-period-cohort decomposition finds that happiness rises with age and is lowest within the baby boom cohort; disparities favoring women, whites,and the better educated shrink with age. Stevenson & Wolfers (2008), too,note convergence in race and gender diferences,accompanied by educational differences that grow over time.\n\nExpressed happiness is greater among married people and those with higher incomes. It also reflects social comparisons (Firebaugh & Tach 2012): Among those at a given income level, those with incomes lower than the average among their age peers tend to be unhappier. Among several studies connecting religious participation with health is that by Maselko & Kubzansky (2006), who report higher happiness and SRH—especially for men—among those engaged in public religious activities like attending services.

Simon & Nath (2Oo4) examine gender diferences in emotionality; when data are aggregated across all 19 reports, men and women experience emotions similarly often, but men are more apt to report positive states and women negative ones. Women are somewhat more likely than men to say that they express rather than suppress emotions they report feeling.\n\nSeveral studies examine intergroup variations in the frequency, intensity,and duration of anger. Older people become angry less often (Schieman 1999); age differences in such factors as satisfaction with finances and family,attendance at religious services,sense of personal control, and health contribute to this.Stets & Tsushima (2Oo1) show that intimate group identities (e.g., family)callforth more intense but shorter episodes of anger than do less intimate role identities such as work.African Americans and whites exhibit no overall difference in the frequency of anger, but sense of control and mistrust are important moderators (Mabry & Kiecolt 2Oo5); for example, mistrust promotes anger among whites but not African Americans. Simon & Lively (2010) link the more intense and long-lasting anger experienced by women to their higher levels of depressive symptomatology.",

A study of the 2002-2014 period (Lowe 2018) found that the Great Recession had little effect on perceived security within a worker's current job, but did lower perceptions of one's more general employability security within the labor market.\n\nBy contrast, job satisfaction has remained essentially steady and relatively high throughout the period covered by the GSS.Firebaugh & Harley (1995) document this through the early 1990s, while Kalleberg & Marsden (2012) extend it through the mid-2000s; the trend continues through 2018.Kalleberg & Marsden report that satisfaction tends to be higher in times of higher unemployment and among those who perceive their jobs and financial situations to be secure.

Bryson (1996) shows that bettereducated, politically tolerant people generally exhibit broader tastes but tend to dislike genres associated with the less educated,thereby distancing themselves from the latter. Goldberg (2011) identifies three distinct taste frameworks espoused by different population segments, involving broad-narrow,“highbrow-lowbrow,”and \"traditional-contemporary”contrasts of genres.Lizardo (2006) examines the interplay between diverse cultural tastes and social network size,finding that they generally reinforce one another; a caveat is that those involved in many highbrow activities tend to have more strong ties, while those participating widely in popular culture are apt to have more weak ones.\n\nTurning to political culture, ISSP data show that Americans display high patriotism and national pride by comparison with residents of other countries (Smith & Kim 2O06).Bonikowski & DiMaggio’s (2O16) study of nationalism among Americans identifies two polar (\"ardent”and “disengaged\") types,together with intermediate ethnocultural (\"restrictive\") and civic varieties.\n\nLevels of national pride,and the ardent and restrictive forms of nationalism, were more frequent in 2004 than in 1996; both articles atribute this to the influence of the September 11,2001,terrorist attacks.",

      "content": "Since its inception,the GSS project has built a prospectively assembled record of the current characteristics,backgrounds,behaviors,and attitudes of representative cross sections of American adults covering more than two generations and over a century of birth cohorts.As such,its data become increasingly valuable with each added round.\n\nWhile this article does not aspire toward any broadly comprehensive statement about recent US social change,our review of GSS-based research findings suggests that one should take these elements into account:\n\n■Inequality in socioeconomic standing based on socioeconomic origins persists and may be rising in some subgroups,while some race and gender disparities have shrunk. Perceived health status and overall happiness remained largely steady, but gaps in both related to socioeconomic status could be widening. Fewer Americans claim to have a religious afliation or participate in organized religionnotwithstanding stability in many religious beliefs—while intense religiosity persists. Acceptance of principles of equal treatment by race,modern rather than traditional roles for women, civil liberties,and the morality of homosexual relationships grew,though at uneven rates. Much diversity in views and few steady (or even monotonic) trends are apparent for many sociopolitical atitudes,including those related to balancing governmental and individual responsibility,intervening to reduce ascriptive inequalities,gun control,abortion rights and sexual morality (other than homosexual relationships),and environmental protection. Americans’ social ties to one another underwent little overall change—remaining highly segregated along racial, socioeconomic,religious,and other axes—while interpersonal trust fell. While few attitude distributions became more widely dispersed,certain social and political identities became increasingly consolidated,and partisan-related gaps in views about several sociopolitical issues rose.\n\nResearch bearing on these domains draws on many databases,of course.The GSS is important for all of them—and indispensable for some—due to its breadth of content, richness of background information,attention to over-time comparability of measurement,and extended observation period allowing even slow-moving trends to be recognized.Its participation in ISSP casts light on where the United States is—and is not—exceptional, while facilitating comparative srvey research.\n\nOur review could not cover allsocial science fields that GSS research has advanced.Among those omitted are aging,family and living arrangements,life satisfaction,Internet use, knowledge of and attitudes toward science,and work-family conflict.\n\nIn keeping with the Annual Review of Sociology's mision,our article emphasizes research works that flow from the GSS.We should call attention to some its collateral contributions as well. Very widely utilized in teaching both research methods and substantive social science,the GSS is used in more than 2,0o textbooks and instructional manuals,and hundreds of thousands of students analyze it in coursework every year. More than 5,0oO theses and dissertations employ it. Every year, several thousand stories based on the GSS appear in the media.By virtue of its visibility, representativenessand high response rate,other surveys often use the GSS as a benchmark for comparison with their findings.Its research instruments are freely available to the research community and the project encourages their adoption.\n\nLooking forward, we expect that the GSS will sustain its efforts to produce and disseminate data on US social trends,while remaining part of ISSP—which yields additional trend data through its periodic replications of modules covering the role of government, family and gender roles, the environment, national identity,and other subjects.Among anticipated near-term content innovations are topical modules on Internet (including social media) use and privacy,and on challenges of preserving freedom and civil liberties while protecting against terrorist threats. Collaboration with the American National Election Survey (ANES) willintroduce additional political/electoral behavior content into the GSS and a variety of GSS content into the ANES panel.\n\nWhile respondent-provided survey data are the centerpiece of the GSS,linking them to archival and administrative data enhances their value.Such data refer to multiple levels of analysis (households,neighborhoods,and metropolitan areas)and come from diverse Census,commercial, and governmental sources. Recent GSS rounds make more such data linkages as part of a general multilevel, multisource (MLMS) strategy (Smith 2011).MLMS strategies augment respondentlevel data with social, economic,and environmental information that informs substantively oriented contextual analysis, aids in survey management, and provides added resources for detecting and adjusting for nonresponse bias.In these and other ways,future development of the GSS will further strengthen its capacity to support social science discovery that tracks and understands continuity and change in US society.",
