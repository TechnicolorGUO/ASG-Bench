## Introduction

The study of psychobiological processes of stress and health has emerged as a critical area within psychology, bridging the gap between psychological experiences and their physiological manifestations. Stress, as a multifaceted phenomenon, influences not only mental well-being but also physical health, immune function, and behavioral responses. Over the past few years, research has increasingly focused on understanding how these psychobiological mechanisms operate, how they are modulated by individual and environmental factors, and how they can be harnessed or mitigated to improve health outcomes. This growing body of work has been enriched by interdisciplinary approaches, integrating insights from psychology, neuroscience, machine learning, and behavioral science to develop more nuanced and comprehensive models of stress and health. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of advanced computational techniques, such as stacked ensemble learning, to predict mental health conditions with high accuracy, highlighting the role of data-driven methods in understanding psychological states [5]. At the same time, research on prosocial behavior and empathy has revealed how internal homeostatic processes and affective mechanisms contribute to social interactions, suggesting that psychological well-being is deeply intertwined with social dynamics [1]. The influence of health threats on social behavior has also been explored through generative agent-based modeling, where disease-related stressors can alter social engagement patterns, underscoring the bidirectional relationship between health and sociality [3]. In the realm of healthcare, the integration of emotional support and knowledge delivery in conversational systems has shown that empathy can enhance patient experience without compromising medical accuracy, reinforcing the importance of emotional intelligence in health communication [2]. Furthermore, the mental health needs of caregivers, particularly those supporting individuals with Alzheimer's and dementia, have been highlighted as dynamic and evolving, necessitating adaptive and scalable interventions [4]. These findings collectively point to the complexity of psychobiological processes, where psychological stressors interact with biological systems and social contexts in ways that are not easily reducible to single-factor explanations. The increasing use of AI and machine learning in modeling these processes offers new opportunities for prediction, intervention, and personalization, but also raises important ethical and methodological questions. As the field continues to evolve, it becomes essential to synthesize these diverse perspectives, identify common themes, and address the challenges that arise in translating theoretical insights into practical applications. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on psychobiological processes of stress and health, emphasizing the interplay between psychological, physiological, and social dimensions, and exploring the implications for both theory and practice.

## Background

The study of psychobiological processes of stress and health in psychology has evolved significantly with the integration of computational methods and artificial intelligence. Traditional psychological research has long relied on self-report measures, physiological assessments, and behavioral observations to understand how stress influences health outcomes. However, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and their increasing application in psychological research has introduced new possibilities for modeling cognitive and emotional processes. These models, while powerful, require careful interpretation to avoid conflating computational outputs with psychological constructs, as highlighted by the dual-validity framework that emphasizes the need for computational analogues of psychological phenomena and scalable standards of evidence [8]. This framework underscores the importance of distinguishing between measurement, characterization, simulation, and modeling of psychological constructs, which is crucial for ensuring the validity of AI-based psychological research. Recent advances in AI have also led to the development of psychological simulators, which aim to replicate human cognitive and emotional processes. These simulators, however, require methodological guidance to ensure they are grounded in psychological theory and empirically validated. The use of LLMs as simulators has shown promise in modeling conversational interactions and emotional support, but challenges remain in capturing the complexity of human social dynamics. For instance, existing simulations often neglect key aspects such as social disclosure and social awareness, which are critical in emotional support contexts. The introduction of frameworks like SocialSim addresses this gap by integrating these elements into synthetic emotional support conversations, thereby enhancing the realism and effectiveness of AI-driven psychological interventions [10]. In parallel, the application of AI in mental health support has gained attention, particularly in the context of caregiving for individuals with Alzheimer’s and dementia. These caregivers face unique stressors and require tailored support systems that are both emotionally responsive and data-secure. Research in this area has led to the development of AI chatbots such as Carey, which are designed to meet the specific needs of caregivers, including personalization, emotional support, and privacy protection. Such systems exemplify the growing emphasis on human-centered AI design, where psychological needs are prioritized in the development of computational tools [6]. This trend reflects a broader movement toward creating AI systems that not only perform well but also align with human values and psychological well-being. The integration of causal inference methods into psychological research has further advanced the understanding of stress and health. Longitudinal data analysis, for example, has revealed the limitations of traditional causal inference techniques in psychiatry, particularly in the face of symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding. To address these challenges, methods like DEBIAS have been proposed to learn optimal outcome definitions that enhance causal identifiability and reduce bias. These approaches are particularly relevant to psychobiological research, where the interplay between stress, physiological responses, and long-term health outcomes is complex and multifaceted [7]. Moreover, the ethical implications of AI in psychological research and practice cannot be overlooked. Issues such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and transparency are central to ensuring that AI systems are not only effective but also trustworthy. The dual-validity framework and other methodological guidelines stress the importance of empirical validation and ethical considerations in AI research, particularly when these systems are used in sensitive domains like mental health and emotional support. The design of AI systems that are both technically sound and ethically aligned with human psychological needs is a growing priority in the field [9]. Overall, the intersection of psychology, computational modeling, and AI has opened new avenues for understanding the psychobiological processes of stress and health. While significant progress has been made, ongoing research is needed to refine these methods, validate their applications, and ensure their ethical deployment. The evolving landscape of AI in psychology underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, rigorous validation, and a human-centered approach to technological innovation. As these tools continue to develop, they hold the potential to transform how we study and intervene in stress-related health issues, offering new insights into the complex interplay between mind, body, and environment.

## Current State of the Art

The current state of the art in psychobiological processes of stress and health in psychology has seen significant advancements, driven by the integration of machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs) into the analysis of mental health and emotional states. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of these technologies to not only detect but also understand and respond to psychological stress and well-being in more nuanced and adaptive ways. The field has moved beyond traditional self-reporting methods and is increasingly leveraging multi-modal data sources, such as electroencephalography (EEG), biometric signals, behavioral patterns, and linguistic cues, to create more accurate and holistic models of psychological states [15]. This shift has been accompanied by a growing emphasis on generalizability, adaptability, and ethical considerations in AI-driven mental health applications. One of the most prominent developments has been the use of EEG for decoding mental states, with the EEG Foundation Challenge setting a benchmark for cross-task and cross-subject decoding [15]. This work has demonstrated that EEG can be a valuable tool for inferring psychological states, including stress and depression, and has encouraged the development of tunable neural network architectures that can generalize across different tasks and individuals. Similarly, the Automatic Depression Assessment using Machine Learning survey has underscored the need for comprehensive multi-modal approaches, emphasizing the integration of brain activity, verbal, and non-verbal behavioral data for more robust depression detection [13]. These studies have identified gaps in current methodologies that rely on limited data modalities and have called for more systematic and integrated approaches to mental health assessment. In the domain of emotion detection, recent work has explored the effectiveness of behavioral data, such as mouse and keystroke activity, as a more accurate and less intrusive alternative to biometric-based methods [18]. This research has demonstrated that machine learning models, particularly GRU networks, can effectively predict emotional states from behavioral patterns, suggesting new possibilities for real-time emotional monitoring in digital environments. Additionally, the EmoStage framework has introduced a novel approach to empathetic response generation by incorporating perspective-taking and phase recognition, enabling AI systems to generate more contextually appropriate and emotionally resonant responses without requiring extensive retraining [17]. This work highlights the growing interest in creating AI systems that not only detect emotions but also respond to them in a socially and emotionally intelligent manner. The role of LLMs in mental health research has also gained traction, with studies exploring their potential for both therapeutic applications and bias detection. The Spiritual-LLM project, for instance, has investigated how LLMs inspired by spiritual texts can be used to support mental health therapy, demonstrating the potential of domain-specific language models in psychological interventions [16]. On the other hand, the Mental Health Equity in LLMs paper has raised critical concerns about the biases embedded in large language models, particularly with respect to age, race, gender, and socioeconomic status [11]. This research has introduced a multi-hop question answering framework to detect and mitigate these biases, emphasizing the importance of fairness and inclusivity in AI-driven mental health systems. Beyond technical advancements, there is a growing recognition of the ethical and societal implications of AI in mental health. Studies have addressed issues such as privacy, data security, and the potential for algorithmic bias, particularly in the context of marginalized populations. For example, the AI-based Approach in Early Warning Systems has explored how AI can enhance emergency communication and citizen participation in Nordic countries, highlighting the potential for AI to support mental health in crisis situations [14]. Similarly, the CareLab project has demonstrated the use of domain-aware transformers for insomnia detection and food safety event extraction, showing the potential for AI to support both mental and physical health in real-world settings [12]. Overall, the current state of the art in psychobiological processes of stress and health in psychology reflects a dynamic and interdisciplinary landscape, where machine learning and AI are being used to enhance our understanding of mental health, improve diagnostic accuracy, and develop more empathetic and equitable AI systems. The field is moving toward more integrated, multi-modal, and ethically conscious approaches, with a strong emphasis on generalization, adaptability, and real-world applicability. As these technologies continue to evolve, they hold the promise of transforming how we assess, understand, and intervene in psychological stress and health.

## Future Directions

The future of psychobiological research on stress and health in psychology is poised to benefit from a convergence of computational innovation, interdisciplinary collaboration, and a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between psychological and biological systems. Emerging methodologies, such as diffusion-based models and large language models, are not only reshaping the landscape of data analysis but also offering new ways to explore the mechanisms underlying stress responses and health outcomes. For instance, the development of training-free diffusion techniques, as demonstrated in the generation of condition-aware facial aging trajectories [19], suggests potential applications in modeling the long-term biological consequences of chronic stress, where environmental and physiological variables interact in non-linear ways. Similarly, the integration of gene regulatory networks into single-cell perturbation estimation [20] highlights the value of biologically informed computational frameworks in uncovering the molecular underpinnings of stress-related disorders, providing a more granular understanding of cellular responses to psychological stressors. In the realm of affective computing, the introduction of the Affective Priming Score [19] underscores the importance of addressing data-level biases that may distort the interpretation of psychological states. This is particularly relevant in the context of stress and health, where subtle shifts in affective states can have significant implications for mental and physical well-being. The development of robust data-driven methods to detect and mitigate priming effects can enhance the reliability of psychological assessments and improve the validity of stress-related research. Furthermore, the use of large language models as symbolic representations of cultural dynamics [22] opens new avenues for exploring how societal and cultural factors influence stress perception and coping mechanisms, suggesting that psychobiological research must increasingly account for the broader socio-cultural context. The growing emphasis on human-centric AI systems, as seen in the PsyLite technical report [21], points to the need for models that not only process psychological data accurately but also ensure dialogue safety and ethical considerations. As psychobiological research increasingly relies on AI-driven tools for data analysis and intervention, the design of models that align with human values and psychological well-being becomes critical. This includes the development of lightweight, efficient models that can be deployed in real-world settings, such as mental health applications, where resource constraints and user safety are paramount. Moreover, the application of diffusion models, such as those used in facial aging trajectory generation [19], may offer novel ways to simulate and predict the long-term effects of stress on biological aging. By incorporating multiple conditional factors, these models can provide insights into how different stressors interact with individual and environmental variables to shape health outcomes. Similarly, the use of symbolic frameworks, such as those proposed for understanding cultural dynamics through large language models [22], may help bridge the gap between psychological theory and empirical data, enabling more nuanced interpretations of stress-related phenomena. In summary, the future of psychobiological research on stress and health will likely be shaped by the integration of advanced computational methods with domain-specific knowledge, the development of human-centered AI systems, and a greater emphasis on data-driven innovation. As these trends continue to evolve, they will not only enhance our understanding of the mechanisms linking stress and health but also pave the way for more effective interventions and personalized approaches to mental and physical well-being.
