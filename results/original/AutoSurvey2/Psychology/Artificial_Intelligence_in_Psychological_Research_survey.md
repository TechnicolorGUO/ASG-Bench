The integration of AI into psychological research has opened new avenues for exploring complex cognitive processes, improving diagnostic accuracy, and developing personalized therapeutic strategies. Over the past decade, the application of AI in psychological contexts has expanded significantly, driven by advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and multimodal data analysis. This survey paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of AI in psychological research, highlighting key developments, challenges, and future directions. The use of AI in psychological research is not merely a technological enhancement but a paradigm shift that redefines how psychological phenomena are studied, modeled, and applied in real-world settings. One of the most prominent areas where AI has made an impact is in the development of virtual reality (VR) systems as psychological countermeasures, particularly in isolated and confined environments (ICEs) such as space missions or remote work settings. While VR has shown promise in promoting relaxation, improving mood, and supporting cognitive training, the application of AI in these contexts remains underexplored, as noted in a scoping review that found no eligible AI-based psychological countermeasure studies [6]. This gap underscores the need for further research into how AI can be integrated into VR-based interventions to enhance their effectiveness and adaptability. Concurrently, AI has been increasingly applied in educational settings, where it plays a role in data mining, assessment design, and personalized learning. Studies have compared symbolic, sub-symbolic, and neural-symbolic AI methods, emphasizing the importance of interpretability and generalizability in AI systems used for educational purposes [3]. These findings suggest that AI's role in psychology is not limited to clinical applications but extends to broader cognitive and developmental domains. The growing reliance on AI in psychological research also raises important questions about its limitations and ethical implications. For instance, while AI has been used in physics for over 30 years to analyze complex datasets, its application in psychology requires careful consideration of its societal impact and potential biases [8]. Similarly, the concept of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) remains a topic of intense debate, with no consensus on its definition or feasibility [1]. This lack of clarity highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of AI's capabilities and limitations, particularly when applied to human-centric domains like psychology. Furthermore, the use of AI in education has prompted concerns about academic integrity and the reliability of AI detection tools, leading to the development of AI-resilient assessment strategies that encourage critical thinking [2]. These issues reflect a broader trend in AI research, where the focus is shifting from mere performance metrics to the ethical, social, and interpretative dimensions of AI systems. Another significant development in AI-driven psychological research is the use of embedding techniques in multimodal machine learning for mental illness assessment. By combining textual, visual, and physiological data, researchers are able to develop more accurate and context-aware models of psychological states [7]. This approach not only enhances diagnostic precision but also supports the development of personalized interventions tailored to individual needs. In parallel, the application of AI in detecting conditions such as PTSD through clinical interviews has demonstrated the potential of natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) to analyze complex linguistic patterns [4]. However, these advancements also raise concerns about data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the need for transparent and accountable AI systems. As AI continues to permeate psychological research, there is an increasing demand for frameworks that ensure responsible and trustworthy AI use, particularly in sensitive domains where human well-being is at stake. The evolving landscape of AI in psychological research is also shaped by the need for human-centered approaches that prioritize interpretability, collaboration, and ethical considerations. Studies have emphasized the importance of integrating cognitive, motivational, and metacognitive factors into AI models to improve their relevance and applicability in real-world settings [3]. This human-in-the-loop approach not only enhances the reliability of AI systems but also fosters trust among users and stakeholders. Moreover, the intersection of AI with other fields, such as law, democracy, and health, has highlighted the broader implications of AI deployment, calling for interdisciplinary collaboration and policy development [5]. As AI continues to reshape psychological research, it is essential to address these challenges and opportunities through a holistic and inclusive approach that balances innovation with responsibility.

## Background

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increasingly become a transformative force across various domains, and its integration into psychological research is no exception. The evolution of AI, particularly in natural language processing and machine learning, has opened new avenues for understanding human cognition, emotion, and behavior. Early explorations in AI have been marked by a focus on technical capabilities, but recent studies have shifted toward examining the psychological and ethical dimensions of AI systems, particularly their interactions with humans. This shift is reflected in the growing body of literature that explores how AI can influence emotional well-being, trust, and even the perception of human nature. For instance, research has shown that AI chatbots can enhance happiness, especially when engaging in conversations about negative topics, due to their ability to mirror sentiment and exhibit a positivity bias [9]. Such findings suggest that AI is not merely a tool for data processing but also a medium through which emotional and psychological dynamics can be studied and potentially influenced. The increasing sophistication of large language models (LLMs) has further complicated the landscape, as these systems are now capable of simulating complex human-like interactions. However, this advancement raises important questions about the psychological implications of such interactions. For example, studies have revealed that LLMs may exhibit a systemic distrust in humans, with a negative correlation between model intelligence and trust in human nature [10]. This finding underscores the need for a deeper understanding of how AI systems perceive and interact with humans, and how these perceptions might shape user experiences and behaviors. Additionally, the use of AI in psychological research has led to the development of new methodologies, such as the creation of psychological scales to assess AI’s attitudes toward human nature, as well as the application of computational models to analyze sentiment and emotional responses [10]. These innovations highlight the interdisciplinary nature of AI in psychology, where technical advancements are paired with psychological insights to create more nuanced and effective research tools. Beyond the emotional and cognitive aspects, AI is also being explored for its potential to enhance knowledge acquisition and reasoning. One notable contribution is the theoretical framework that distinguishes between "knowledge that" and "knowledge why," emphasizing the importance of causal understanding in AI systems [11]. This distinction has significant implications for psychological research, as it suggests that AI models must go beyond pattern recognition and probabilistic inference to achieve a deeper, more human-like understanding of the world. Furthermore, the application of AI in psychological studies has led to the development of new experimental designs, including randomized controlled trials and large-scale data analyses, which have provided valuable insights into the effects of AI on emotional well-being and user behavior [12]. These methodological advancements have not only improved the rigor of AI research but have also expanded the scope of psychological inquiry, enabling researchers to explore complex phenomena that were previously difficult to study. Despite these advancements, the integration of AI into psychological research is not without challenges. Ethical concerns, such as the potential for AI to influence human behavior in unintended ways, have sparked debates about the responsibility of developers and researchers. Additionally, the reliance on AI for psychological assessments and interventions raises questions about the validity and reliability of such tools. For example, while some studies suggest that AI can improve well-being through supportive conversations, others highlight the risk of dependency and the need for careful monitoring of user engagement [12]. These contrasting viewpoints underscore the complexity of AI's role in psychological research and the need for continued investigation into its long-term effects. As AI continues to evolve, it is clear that its impact on psychological research will be both profound and multifaceted, requiring a balanced approach that considers both its potential and its limitations.

One notable development is the application of deep learning techniques to mental health data, as seen in the LatentGLoss approach, which enhances text classification in mental health by employing a teacher-student architecture with a novel loss function [21]. This method underscores the importance of model design and the adaptation of loss functions to better capture the nuances of psychological data. Similarly, AI-based clinical decision support systems have gained traction, with studies highlighting the need for more realistic and ecologically valid evaluations that go beyond traditional metrics like trust and reliance [22]. These systems are increasingly being designed to support, rather than replace, human expertise, reflecting a broader trend toward human-AI collaboration in psychological research and practice. The evaluation of AI systems has also evolved, with a focus on both task-specific and general intelligence benchmarks. The AGITB benchmark, for instance, provides a rigorous framework for assessing artificial general intelligence through signal-level tasks that reflect fundamental computational invariants [13]. In contrast, the AI Index Report 2025 offers a comprehensive overview of AI trends, including hardware advancements, inference costs, and corporate AI ethics, serving as a valuable resource for policymakers and researchers [19]. These efforts highlight the need for standardized metrics and benchmarks to assess AI performance in psychological contexts, ensuring that models are not only accurate but also interpretable and aligned with human cognitive processes. Despite these advancements, there remains a significant gap between the expectations and the reality of AI adoption in psychological research. Studies on AI in software testing, for example, reveal that while AI holds promise, its real-world impact has been limited, with many systems failing to deliver on their potential [14]. This trend is echoed in the healthcare domain, where AI-based clinical decision support systems often struggle to translate theoretical success into practical benefits. Such findings emphasize the importance of responsible AI practices, including transparency, explainability, and ethical considerations, which are increasingly being integrated into AI design and deployment [20]. Moreover, the role of human-AI interaction has become a central theme in psychological research. Studies on AI-assisted decision-making, such as those exploring how AI can support complex decision-making by providing different kinds of cognitive support, suggest that the most effective AI systems are those that enhance human capabilities rather than replace them [18]. This perspective is further reinforced by research on human-AI teaming, which highlights the need for adaptive, context-aware systems that can dynamically adjust to user needs and preferences [16]. In addition to these developments, there is growing interest in the use of AI for personalized learning and educational applications. Research on Socratic tutors and AI-driven learning systems demonstrates the potential of AI to support research question development and student reflection, with some studies exploring multi-agent strategies for automated assessment [17]. These approaches not only improve the efficiency of educational processes but also enhance the quality of learning by providing tailored feedback and support. Similarly, the application of AI in persona development and agent-based modeling has opened new avenues for understanding human behavior and decision-making in complex environments [15]. Overall, the current state of the art in AI for psychological research reflects a dynamic and rapidly evolving field. While significant progress has been made in areas such as mental health classification, clinical decision support, and human-AI collaboration, challenges remain in terms of evaluation, ethical considerations, and real-world implementation. Future research will likely focus on bridging the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications, ensuring that AI systems are not only powerful but also trustworthy, interpretable, and aligned with the needs of psychological science and human users.

Future work should prioritize the creation of context-specific evaluation frameworks that account for the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of psychological and mental health interventions. This includes the use of longitudinal studies, real-world deployment trials, and interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers, psychologists, and clinicians. Ethical and safety considerations remain central to the future of AI in psychological research. As AI systems become more capable and pervasive, the risks associated with their misuse or misinterpretation grow. Studies have pointed to the need for comprehensive fairness assessments, ensuring that AI models do not perpetuate biases or disparities in mental health care [23]. Additionally, the potential for AI to influence human behavior and cognition, as seen in the framing of psychological phenomena, necessitates careful scrutiny [24]. Future research should address these concerns through the development of robust ethical frameworks, regulatory standards, and ongoing monitoring of AI impacts on psychological well-being. Finally, the intersection of AI with cognitive science and neural data analysis presents new opportunities for advancing our understanding of human cognition. Techniques such as sequence modeling for by-trial decoding of cognitive strategies and adversarial learning for multi-site fMRI mental disorder identification demonstrate the potential for AI to uncover novel insights into brain function and behavior [27]. These developments suggest that AI will play an increasingly important role in both theoretical and applied psychological research, offering tools to analyze complex data and generate hypotheses that were previously inaccessible. As the field moves forward, interdisciplinary collaboration and a commitment to ethical, transparent, and user-centered AI design will be essential in realizing the full potential of these technologies.
