## Introduction

The field of positive psychology has increasingly recognized the importance of holistic, multicomponent interventions in fostering adolescent well-being and mitigating distress. As mental health challenges among adolescents continue to rise, there is a growing need for evidence-based strategies that address multiple dimensions of psychological functioning, including emotional resilience, social connectedness, and personal growth. Recent advancements in both psychological science and computational modeling have paved the way for more sophisticated and integrated approaches to intervention design, evaluation, and personalization. This survey paper explores the current state of multicomponent positive psychology interventions, with a focus on their application in adolescent populations and their impact on well-being and distress. Over the past decade, research has demonstrated that single-component interventions, such as mindfulness training or cognitive restructuring, often yield limited or inconsistent outcomes. In contrast, multicomponent interventions that combine elements such as gratitude practices, goal-setting, social support, and emotional regulation have shown greater promise in enhancing psychological well-being and reducing symptoms of distress. These interventions are typically structured to address multiple psychological constructs simultaneously, thereby creating synergistic effects that may be more effective than isolated strategies. The increasing availability of large-scale behavioral and psychological data, coupled with advances in machine learning and natural language processing, has enabled researchers to better understand the mechanisms underlying these interventions and to tailor them more effectively to individual needs. A significant body of research has also highlighted the role of technology in delivering and enhancing positive psychology interventions. For instance, large language models (LLMs) have been explored for their potential in crisis detection and psychological support, showing promising results in identifying suicidal ideation and other critical mental health concerns [1]. Similarly, multimodal approaches have been developed to handle the complexity of emotional and behavioral data, with methods such as confidence-aware self-distillation improving the robustness of sentiment analysis in the presence of missing modalities [2]. These technological innovations have not only expanded the reach of positive psychology interventions but also provided new tools for assessing their effectiveness in real-world settings. Moreover, the integration of computational models with psychological theories has led to the development of more nuanced frameworks for understanding and predicting human behavior. Techniques such as diffusion-based modeling of medical treatment outcomes [3] and joint modeling of decision-making dynamics in behavioral experiments [4] have provided valuable insights into how individuals process information, make choices, and respond to interventions. These approaches underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, as they bridge the gap between psychological theory and data-driven modeling. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the design, implementation, and evaluation of multicomponent interventions. Issues such as variability in individual responses, the need for personalized adaptation, and the complexity of measuring long-term outcomes continue to pose significant research questions. Additionally, while machine learning models have shown great potential in detecting and responding to psychological distress, ethical considerations regarding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the role of human oversight remain critical. As the field continues to evolve, it is essential to build on the existing body of work by fostering more integrated, adaptive, and ethically grounded approaches to promoting adolescent well-being through multicomponent positive psychology interventions.

## Background

The field of positive psychology has increasingly recognized the importance of multicomponent interventions in promoting adolescent well-being and mitigating distress. Traditional interventions often focus on single constructs such as gratitude, mindfulness, or optimism, yet emerging research suggests that combining multiple psychological components may yield more robust and sustainable outcomes. This shift towards multicomponent approaches is supported by advances in computational modeling, experimental design, and data-driven methodologies that enable a more nuanced understanding of how different psychological elements interact and influence mental health. For instance, the development of retrieval-augmented multi-agent frameworks, such as MoodAngels, has demonstrated the potential for AI systems to integrate diverse clinical data sources and improve diagnostic accuracy, offering insights into how complex systems can be analyzed and optimized [6]. These systems, which leverage synthetic datasets like MoodSyn, highlight the importance of privacy-preserving data practices while maintaining clinical validity, a critical consideration in adolescent mental health research. In parallel, the design of interventions has benefited from probabilistic factorial experimental designs that allow for the efficient evaluation of combinatorial interventions. This approach reduces the need for exhaustive trial-and-error methods, instead enabling researchers to identify optimal combinations of psychological components through closed-form solutions and adaptive multi-round experimentation [5]. Such methodologies are particularly relevant in the context of adolescent well-being, where the interplay between multiple factors—such as emotional regulation, social support, and self-efficacy—can significantly influence outcomes. Furthermore, the ability to model joint interventional effects from single-variable interventions provides a powerful tool for understanding causal relationships within complex psychological systems [9]. This line of research underscores the need for rigorous causal inference techniques to evaluate the impact of multicomponent interventions in real-world settings. The integration of linguistic and social norms into psychological interventions has also gained traction, as evidenced by the development of large-scale lexicons that capture warmth, trust, and sociability associated with over 26,000 English words [7]. These resources offer a data-driven approach to understanding how language can be harnessed to foster positive psychological states, particularly in adolescent populations where social dynamics play a significant role in emotional development. Additionally, the use of probabilistic and Bayesian inference techniques has enabled more flexible and scalable approaches to modeling uncertainty in psychological data, as seen in amortized variational transdimensional inference methods that facilitate multi-model learning [8]. These methodologies contribute to a growing body of work that emphasizes the importance of adaptability and interpretability in psychological interventions. Across these diverse approaches, a common theme is the increasing recognition of the need for multivariate and combinatorial analysis in understanding adolescent mental health. The shift from single-component to multicomponent interventions reflects a broader trend in psychological science toward more holistic and integrated approaches. This evolution is further supported by interdisciplinary collaborations that bring together computational methods, experimental design, and psychological theory to develop more effective and scalable interventions. As research continues to advance, the integration of these methodologies will be essential in designing interventions that are not only effective but also adaptable to the unique needs of adolescent populations.

## Current State of the Art

The current state of the art in multicomponent positive psychology interventions in adolescent well-being and distress reflects a growing convergence of artificial intelligence, psychology, and data science to develop adaptive, personalized, and scalable solutions. Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of AI-driven systems to support emotional regulation, enhance self-awareness, and foster resilience among adolescents, particularly through multi-modal and multi-session approaches. A significant body of research has focused on leveraging large language models (LLMs) to interpret and respond to emotional cues, with studies showing that LLM-derived embeddings can improve the accuracy of depression detection from social media text [12]. These findings underscore the importance of natural language processing in identifying early signs of distress and tailoring interventions accordingly. Moreover, the development of multi-session conversational models has shown promise in providing continuous support for adolescents. The MusPsy-Model, for instance, was designed to simulate real-world psychological counseling sessions, demonstrating improved adaptability and progress tracking compared to baseline models [13]. This model highlights the value of longitudinal data in capturing the evolving needs of users and delivering interventions that align with their psychological development. Similarly, the AI PsyRoom platform integrates segmented yearning and reactive outcome optimization, enhancing the quality of interactions by improving problem orientation, expression, and empathy in AI-driven dialogues [14]. Such platforms not only support emotional expression but also help in building more meaningful and effective therapeutic relationships. In parallel, research has explored the use of physiological signals, such as electrodermal activity (EDA), to monitor stress and emotional states in real-world settings. The Feel Transformer model, which applies a Transformer-based approach to EDA decomposition, has shown superior performance in noisy and dynamic environments, opening new possibilities for real-time mental health monitoring [11]. This integration of physiological data with AI algorithms allows for a more holistic understanding of an adolescent's emotional state, enabling interventions that are both timely and contextually relevant. Another key trend in the field is the emphasis on personalization and adaptability. Many systems now incorporate mechanisms to adjust their responses based on individual user profiles, ensuring that interventions are not only effective but also engaging. This is particularly important in adolescent populations, where emotional and social contexts vary widely. The AI peers study, for example, examined how learners perceive AI characters in collaborative learning environments, revealing that trust and social presence are crucial factors in the acceptance and effectiveness of AI-based interventions [10]. These insights have informed the design of more socially aware and empathetic AI systems that can better connect with young users. The interdisciplinary nature of this research is evident in the integration of natural language processing, affective computing, and behavioral science. Studies have employed a range of methodologies, from supervised and unsupervised learning to multi-agent simulations and physiological signal analysis, to address different aspects of adolescent mental health. The use of diverse evaluation metrics, including both quantitative measures and qualitative assessments, has further enriched the understanding of how these interventions are perceived and experienced by users. Overall, the current state of the art in multicomponent positive psychology interventions for adolescents showcases a dynamic and rapidly evolving field. While significant progress has been made, challenges remain in ensuring the ethical deployment of AI systems, maintaining user privacy, and fostering long-term engagement. Future research will likely continue to explore the integration of multimodal data, the refinement of adaptive algorithms, and the development of more inclusive and culturally sensitive interventions that address the unique needs of diverse adolescent populations.

## Future Directions

The future of multicomponent positive psychology interventions in adolescent well-being and distress lies in the integration of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that not only enhance personalization and accessibility but also align with ethical, cultural, and human-centered principles. As the field evolves, several key directions emerge from the synthesis of recent research. First, there is a growing need for AI systems that act as supportive scaffolds rather than replacements for human interaction, particularly in peer support contexts. Studies have shown that while peer supporters bring unique empathetic and lived experiences to mental health support, they often lack the formal training to recognize nuanced emotional cues or avoid premature advice [19]. AI, through real-time feedback and emotion visualization, can bridge this gap by augmenting peer support training and ensuring that interventions remain psychosocially grounded. This aligns with the broader movement toward responsible AI, as seen in frameworks like RHealthTwin, which emphasizes safety, explainability, and ethical compliance in digital twin applications for well-being [16]. These systems must be designed with a deep understanding of the sociotechnical practices of peer supporters, as highlighted in studies from Singapore, where digital tools are seen as complements to relational care rather than substitutes [20]. Another critical direction involves the development of multimodal and multilingual AI systems that cater to diverse populations. As adolescent well-being is influenced by cultural, linguistic, and contextual factors, interventions must be inclusive and adaptable. The success of multilingual speech emotion recognition models, such as those using multi-teacher language-aware knowledge distillation, underscores the importance of cross-linguistic and cross-cultural sensitivity in AI-driven mental health tools [18]. Similarly, the integration of multimodal data—such as audio, text, and physiological signals—can provide a more comprehensive understanding of emotional states and distress indicators, as demonstrated in frameworks like MEDUSA for speech emotion recognition in naturalistic conditions [22]. This approach not only improves accuracy but also enhances the relevance of interventions for adolescents from different backgrounds. Moreover, the future of these interventions will likely involve more dynamic and adaptive methodologies. Techniques such as causal change point detection, which uses adaptive interventions to identify critical moments in mental health trajectories, offer a promising avenue for early intervention and personalized support [15]. These methods can help tailor interventions in real time, responding to shifts in an adolescent’s emotional state or environmental factors. At the same time, the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in mental health contexts raises important questions about their reliability, bias, and alignment with human values. Studies like CounselBench, which evaluate the performance of LLMs in mental health question answering, highlight the need for rigorous benchmarking and adversarial testing to ensure that AI systems are not only effective but also safe and equitable [17]. In parallel, there is a growing recognition of the importance of human-AI collaboration in mental health. While AI can offer scalability and efficiency, it must be designed to work in tandem with human experts and peer supporters. This requires not only technical advancements but also a rethinking of how AI systems are integrated into existing mental health ecosystems. For instance, frameworks that promote perspective-taking, such as UniToMBench, suggest that AI can be designed to better understand and respond to the social and emotional contexts of users [21]. This human-in-the-loop approach is essential for ensuring that AI-driven interventions remain empathetic, culturally relevant, and aligned with the values of the communities they serve. Looking ahead, the development of multicomponent positive psychology interventions must continue to prioritize ethical and responsible AI design. As AI becomes more embedded in adolescent mental health support, it is crucial to address issues of transparency, fairness, and long-term impact. This includes ensuring that AI systems do not perpetuate existing biases, that they are accessible to underserved populations, and that they are continuously evaluated for their effectiveness and safety. By combining technical innovation with a strong ethical foundation, the future of AI in adolescent well-being and distress holds significant promise for creating more inclusive, responsive, and effective mental health interventions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this survey paper has examined the evolving landscape of multicomponent positive psychology interventions in the context of adolescent well-being and distress. The key findings underscore the growing recognition that interventions which integrate multiple psychological constructs—such as emotional regulation, social connectedness, and personal growth—offer more comprehensive and enduring benefits compared to single-component approaches. By leveraging insights from psychological science and computational modeling, researchers have demonstrated that multicomponent interventions can effectively enhance resilience, reduce symptoms of distress, and promote holistic development in adolescents. The current state of the field reflects a dynamic integration of artificial intelligence, data science, and positive psychology, enabling the development of adaptive and personalized interventions. These innovations have shown promise in supporting adolescents through multi-modal and multi-session approaches, offering scalable solutions that can be tailored to individual needs. However, while the potential of these interventions is significant, challenges remain in ensuring their ethical deployment, cultural relevance, and long-term efficacy. Future research should focus on refining AI-driven systems to function as supportive scaffolds that augment human interaction rather than replace it. There is a critical need for longitudinal studies to assess the sustained impact of multicomponent interventions and for cross-cultural validation to ensure their applicability across diverse populations. Additionally, the development of robust frameworks for evaluating the ethical implications of AI in mental health interventions remains a pressing concern. As the field continues to advance, it is essential to maintain a human-centered approach that prioritizes the well-being and autonomy of adolescents. The integration of technology with psychological insight holds great promise, but it must be guided by principles of equity, transparency, and inclusivity. Ultimately, multicomponent positive psychology interventions represent a powerful and evolving tool in the broader effort to support the mental health and flourishing of young people in an increasingly complex world.
