      "content": "The increasing demand for sustainable energy sources and the need to mitigate environmental degradation have driven significant interest in biomass conversion technologies. Among these, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) has emerged as a promising process for transforming wet biomass into bio-oil, offering a viable pathway for biorefinery applications. HTL operates under high temperature and pressure conditions, allowing for the efficient conversion of diverse feedstocks, including algae, agricultural residues, and organic waste, into liquid fuels. This process not only reduces reliance on fossil fuels but also contributes to waste valorization and carbon neutrality, aligning with global efforts to achieve a circular economy. As the field of environmental science continues to evolve, the integration of advanced computational methods has become essential in optimizing HTL processes, enhancing their efficiency, and expanding their applicability. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing complex challenges in chemical process design, such as flowsheet synthesis, reaction planning, and system optimization. For instance, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been successfully applied to discover novel separation processes for azeotropic mixtures without prior knowledge, demonstrating the adaptability of AI in chemical engineering contexts [5]. Similarly, the use of transformers and large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in tackling chemistry-related tasks, leveraging natural language analogies to model molecular and reaction systems [4]. These advancements underscore the growing synergy between AI and environmental science, particularly in the context of biorefinery technologies. The integration of domain-specific knowledge into ML models has further enhanced their performance, as seen in the development of physics-aware machine learning (PaML) approaches that bridge the gap between data-driven models and physical principles [3]. Such methodologies are particularly relevant for HTL, where the interplay of thermodynamics, kinetics, and reaction mechanisms necessitates a nuanced understanding of the underlying processes. Moreover, the application of evolutionary algorithms in retrosynthetic route planning has demonstrated the potential for optimizing multi-step chemical transformations, offering insights into how similar strategies could be adapted for biomass conversion processes [2]. The increasing availability of large-scale datasets and the development of parameter-efficient multi-task models have further facilitated the deployment of AI in environmental systems, enabling more accurate predictions and informed decision-making [1]. As the field continues to advance, the focus is shifting towards the explainability and causality of AI models, ensuring that their outputs are not only accurate but also interpretable and aligned with scientific principles. This is particularly important in the context of HTL, where the complexity of the reaction network and the variability of feedstock composition require robust and transparent modeling approaches. By leveraging the strengths of AI and ML, researchers can develop more efficient and sustainable biorefinery systems, paving the way for a greener and more resilient energy future. The convergence of computational methods with traditional chemical engineering practices is thus not only a trend but a necessity, driving innovation and enabling the next generation of biomass conversion technologies."

Among the various conversion technologies, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) has emerged as a promising method for transforming wet biomass into bio-crude oil, which can be further refined into transportation fuels or chemical feedstocks. HTL operates under high pressure and temperature conditions, mimicking natural geological processes, and is particularly effective for feedstocks with high moisture content, such as algae, agricultural residues, and sewage sludge. This process offers advantages over conventional pyrolysis and gasification, including higher energy recovery and lower emissions, making it an attractive option for biorefinery applications in environmental science. Over the years, the development of HTL has been supported by advancements in catalytic systems, reactor designs, and process optimization, which have enhanced the efficiency and scalability of the technology. However, the complexity of biomass composition and the variability of feedstock properties pose significant challenges in achieving consistent product quality and yield. To address these challenges, researchers have increasingly turned to computational models and machine learning (ML) techniques to predict reaction kinetics, optimize process parameters, and understand the underlying mechanisms of biomass transformation. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of integrating AI-driven approaches with HTL, enabling more accurate predictions and enabling the design of more efficient biorefinery systems. For instance, physically interpretable models such as the Mass-Conserving-Perceptron (MCP) have been developed to incorporate fundamental principles of mass conservation and thermodynamics, ensuring that ML-based predictions align with scientific understanding [7]. Similarly, the use of domain-specific large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in facilitating knowledge integration and enabling more efficient data-driven decision-making in complex scientific workflows [6]. These developments highlight the growing intersection between computational science and environmental engineering, where the fusion of domain-specific knowledge with advanced modeling techniques is paving the way for more sustainable and efficient biomass conversion processes. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of AI and ML into HTL research is expected to play a crucial role in advancing biorefinery technologies and supporting the transition to a low-carbon energy future."

      "content": "The current state of the art in hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of biomass for biorefinery applications in environmental science reflects a dynamic and rapidly evolving field that integrates advanced process engineering, sustainable chemistry, and emerging computational methodologies. Over the past decade, HTL has gained significant attention as a promising technology for converting wet biomass into bio-crude oil, which can serve as a renewable feedstock for further refining into transportation fuels and value-added chemicals. This process is particularly advantageous due to its ability to handle high moisture content feedstocks without the need for extensive drying, thereby reducing energy consumption and enhancing overall process efficiency. Recent studies have focused on optimizing reaction conditions, improving yield and quality of bio-crude, and addressing challenges related to feedstock variability, reactor design, and process scalability. One of the key developments in this area is the integration of data-driven and machine learning (ML) approaches to enhance process understanding and control. Similar to trends observed in other domains, such as biopharmaceutical process development and climate modeling, the application of ML in HTL has shown potential in predicting process outcomes, optimizing operational parameters, and enabling real-time monitoring and control [11]. These models often rely on large datasets generated from experimental trials, process sensors, and advanced analytical techniques, allowing for the identification of complex relationships between input variables and output performance. The use of ML has also facilitated the development of predictive models for bio-crude composition and quality, which is critical for downstream refining processes. In parallel, the role of computational methods in materials and process design has become increasingly prominent. For instance, generative models, such as those used in metal-organic framework (MOF) design, have inspired similar approaches in the development of catalysts and reactor configurations for HTL [12]. These models leverage diffusion-based and graph-based techniques to explore a wide range of design possibilities, thereby accelerating the discovery of optimal conditions for biomass conversion. Additionally, the application of topological data analysis (TDA) and persistent homology has been explored in other scientific domains to extract meaningful features from complex datasets, and similar approaches are beginning to be applied in HTL research to gain deeper insights into the structural and compositional changes that occur during the liquefaction process [10]. Another emerging trend is the emphasis on process sustainability and environmental impact assessment. As the global demand for renewable energy sources continues to rise, there is a growing need to evaluate the life-cycle environmental performance of HTL technologies. This includes assessing greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and resource efficiency throughout the entire process chain, from feedstock collection to bio-crude production. Recent studies have incorporated life cycle assessment (LCA) frameworks and other sustainability metrics to guide the development of more environmentally friendly HTL systems. These efforts align with broader initiatives in climate change mitigation and sustainability, where machine learning and quantum computing are also being explored to improve predictive accuracy and optimize system performance [8]. Interpretability and explainability of ML models have also become a critical concern, especially in the context of industrial applications where decisions must be transparent and reliable. While ML models offer powerful predictive capabilities, their \"black-box\" nature can hinder their adoption in regulatory and operational settings. To address this, researchers are increasingly integrating explainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide insights into model behavior and improve trust in data-driven predictions. This trend is not unique to HTL but is observed across multiple fields, including materials science, healthcare, and environmental monitoring, where the need for interpretable models is driven by the real-world consequences of model decisions [9]. Overall, the current state of the art in HTL for biorefinery applications is characterized by a strong interdisciplinary approach that combines experimental research, computational modeling, and data analytics. The field is moving towards more integrated and intelligent systems that can adapt to varying feedstock conditions, optimize process performance, and minimize environmental impact. As the technology matures, further advancements in machine learning, process intensification, and sustainable design will be essential to realizing the full potential of HTL in the transition to a circular and low-carbon economy."

As the field evolves, there is a growing emphasis on integrating machine learning (ML) and language models (LMs) to enhance the predictive capabilities, efficiency, and sustainability of HTL processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that AI can be effectively used to analyze complex data sets, such as mass spectrometry data, to infer chemical properties and reaction pathways, which can be directly applicable to biomass conversion processes [13]. This suggests that similar techniques could be adapted to HTL, where understanding the molecular composition and reaction mechanisms of biomass is critical. One promising direction is the application of language models, such as those used in chemical reaction prediction and molecular design, to model the complex transformations that occur during HTL. For instance, the ReLM framework, which integrates language models with graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown significant improvements in chemical reaction prediction [15]. This approach could be extended to HTL, where the ability to predict the formation of bio-oil, gases, and other byproducts under varying conditions would greatly enhance process optimization. Similarly, the concept of preference optimization for molecular language models, as demonstrated in [14], could be used to tailor HTL models to specific biorefinery goals, such as maximizing bio-oil yield or minimizing energy consumption. Another important area is the development of multimodal data fusion techniques to improve the accuracy of HTL models. The UniMAP model, which combines SMILES and graph representations for molecular learning, highlights the potential of integrating different data modalities to create more robust and interpretable models [17]. In the context of HTL, this could involve combining spectroscopic data, thermodynamic parameters, and reaction kinetics into a unified framework, enabling more accurate predictions of product distributions and process efficiency. The use of advanced search strategies, such as Monte Carlo Thought Search, which enhances scientific reasoning in catalyst design [17], could also be applied to HTL process optimization. By leveraging large language models to generate and evaluate potential process configurations, researchers could identify novel operating conditions or catalysts that improve the overall performance of HTL. This approach aligns with the broader trend of using AI for complex scientific reasoning, as seen in studies on catalyst discovery and molecular design. Moreover, the increasing availability of pre-trained models and transfer learning techniques offers new opportunities for HTL research. By fine-tuning models on domain-specific data, such as biomass feedstock properties or HTL process parameters, researchers can develop more accurate and generalizable predictive models. This is particularly relevant in the context of biorefinery applications, where the variability of feedstocks and operating conditions necessitates adaptable and robust models. In addition, the integration of AI with experimental methods, such as real-time monitoring and feedback control, could revolutionize the way HTL processes are optimized. Techniques like those described in [16], which use large language models to learn rewards for physical skills, could be adapted to control HTL reactors based on dynamic process data, leading to more efficient and sustainable biorefinery operations. Overall, the future of HTL for biorefinery applications is likely to be shaped by the continued convergence of AI, computational chemistry, and process engineering. By leveraging the latest advances in machine learning, language models, and data-driven methodologies, researchers can develop more accurate, efficient, and sustainable HTL processes that contribute to the broader goals of environmental science and renewable energy."
