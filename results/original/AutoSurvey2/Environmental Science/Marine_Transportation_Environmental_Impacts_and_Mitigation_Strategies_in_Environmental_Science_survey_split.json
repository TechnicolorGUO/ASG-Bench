For instance, the development of high-quality datasets, such as the LaRS dataset for maritime obstacle detection, has enabled the training of more accurate and robust models for environmental monitoring [3]. Similarly, machine learning models have been employed to predict environmental degradation and support decision-making in conservation efforts [5]. These models often integrate domain-specific knowledge, such as hydrological and oceanographic data, to improve their interpretability and effectiveness. Furthermore, deep reinforcement learning has shown promise in optimizing energy management systems for marine applications, such as artificial upwelling, which can enhance nutrient cycling and support marine ecosystems [4]. The integration of machine learning with control systems has also contributed to the development of more efficient and adaptive marine technologies. For example, distributed control strategies based on backstepping and neurodynamics have been proposed to enhance the coordination and stability of underwater vehicles, which are essential for monitoring and mitigating environmental changes [1]. These control systems are designed to operate in uncertain and dynamic marine environments, where traditional methods may fall short. Moreover, the application of machine learning in time series prediction has facilitated the analysis of hydrological and water quality data, even in unmonitored regions, by leveraging transfer learning and process-based knowledge [2]. This capability is particularly valuable for assessing the long-term effects of marine transportation on water resources and ecosystems. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in the field. One of the key issues is the need for more comprehensive and diverse datasets that can capture the complexity of marine environments. While some studies have focused on localized monitoring, there is a growing recognition of the importance of large-scale, cross-regional data for more accurate predictions and generalized models. Additionally, the integration of machine learning with mechanistic models remains a critical area for future research, as it can enhance the interpretability and reliability of environmental assessments. Furthermore, the development of explainable AI techniques is essential to ensure that machine learning models are transparent and trustworthy for policymakers and environmental managers. In summary, the environmental impacts of marine transportation are a pressing concern that requires interdisciplinary approaches combining environmental science, engineering, and data analytics. The application of machine learning and advanced control systems has opened new avenues for monitoring, modeling, and mitigating these impacts. As research continues to evolve, the integration of domain knowledge with computational methods will be crucial for developing sustainable solutions that balance economic and ecological priorities. The ongoing efforts in this field not only contribute to the advancement of environmental science but also support the broader goal of achieving sustainable marine transportation systems."
