Cyanobacteria, often referred to as blue-green algae, are among the most ancient and ecologically significant groups of microorganisms on Earth. These photosynthetic prokaryotes play a fundamental role in global biogeochemical cycles, particularly in carbon and nitrogen fixation, and are essential components of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Their ability to thrive in diverse environments—from extreme deserts to freshwater and marine habitats—makes them a subject of great interest in environmental science. Over the past few decades, research on cyanobacteria has expanded significantly, driven by their ecological importance, potential applications in biotechnology, and the challenges they pose in terms of harmful algal blooms and water quality management. This survey paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on cyanobacteria in environmental science, highlighting key findings, methodological advances, and emerging trends. The integration of advanced computational techniques, including machine learning and data-driven modeling, has become increasingly prominent in the study of cyanobacterial dynamics, as evidenced by recent studies that explore the use of domain adaptation, deep learning, and other AI-based approaches to address complex environmental challenges [2]. These methodologies are not only enhancing our understanding of cyanobacterial behavior but also enabling more accurate predictions of their ecological impacts. The interdisciplinary nature of this research, which spans microbiology, remote sensing, environmental engineering, and data science, underscores the growing recognition of the need for collaborative approaches to tackle environmental issues. While traditional ecological studies have provided valuable insights into the role of cyanobacteria in nutrient cycling and ecosystem functioning, modern computational tools are now being leveraged to analyze large-scale environmental datasets, model interactions within microbial communities, and assess the effects of climate change on cyanobacterial populations. This shift toward data-intensive and algorithm-driven research is reshaping the way we study and manage cyanobacteria in natural and anthropogenic environments. Furthermore, the challenges associated with data scarcity, noise, and the need for robust and adaptable models have become central concerns in this field, mirroring similar issues encountered in other areas of environmental science and machine learning [1]. As the demand for sustainable and resilient environmental systems grows, the role of cyanobacteria in both ecological and technological contexts will continue to be a focal point of scientific inquiry. This survey paper synthesizes the key developments in this area, offering a roadmap for future research and highlighting the potential of integrating computational methods with traditional ecological approaches to advance our understanding of cyanobacteria and their environmental significance.

## Background

Cyanobacteria, often referred to as blue-green algae, are among the most ancient and ecologically significant groups of microorganisms on Earth. These prokaryotes are capable of oxygenic photosynthesis and play a critical role in global biogeochemical cycles, particularly in carbon and nitrogen fixation. Their presence and abundance in aquatic and terrestrial environments are closely linked to environmental conditions such as nutrient availability, temperature, light, and water quality. In recent decades, the study of cyanobacteria has gained increasing attention due to their dual role as both essential contributors to ecosystem health and potential sources of environmental and public health risks, particularly when they form harmful algal blooms (HABs). These blooms can produce toxins that contaminate water supplies, harm aquatic life, and pose serious threats to human and animal health. As a result, the accurate detection, monitoring, and analysis of cyanobacteria have become central to environmental science, with significant implications for water resource management, ecological assessment, and public health policies. The integration of advanced data-driven methodologies, including machine learning and remote sensing technologies, has opened new avenues for understanding cyanobacterial dynamics in complex environmental systems. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of spectral analysis, unsupervised classification, and deep learning techniques in detecting and characterizing cyanobacteria in various environments. For instance, unsupervised machine learning approaches have been successfully applied to classify marine debris, including cyanobacterial mats, by analyzing spectral signatures from satellite imagery [4]. Similarly, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other artificial intelligence models has shown promise in predicting the concentration of mixture components from spectroscopic data, which can be adapted for the analysis of cyanobacterial pigments and metabolic byproducts [5]. These methodologies are not only enhancing the accuracy of cyanobacterial detection but also enabling real-time monitoring and predictive modeling, which are essential for early warning systems and environmental management strategies. Furthermore, the development of high-resolution datasets, such as the PurpleAirSF dataset for air quality forecasting, highlights the growing importance of spatio-temporal data in environmental science, which can be extended to the study of cyanobacteria in both marine and freshwater ecosystems [3]. The increasing availability of such datasets, combined with the advancement of data-driven modeling techniques, is transforming the way researchers approach the study of cyanobacteria, allowing for more comprehensive and dynamic analyses of their ecological impacts. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of interdisciplinary approaches, including bioinformatics, remote sensing, and machine learning, will be crucial in addressing the complex challenges associated with cyanobacterial dynamics in a changing environment. The ongoing refinement of these methods will not only improve our ability to monitor and manage cyanobacterial populations but also contribute to broader efforts in environmental sustainability and ecosystem resilience.

## Current State of the Art

The current state of the art in the study of cyanobacteria within environmental science reflects a dynamic interplay between biological understanding, technological innovation, and computational methodologies. Recent advancements have emphasized the integration of remote sensing, machine learning, and data engineering to better monitor, predict, and manage cyanobacterial blooms and their ecological impacts. The use of satellite imagery, particularly from platforms like Sentinel-2, has enabled large-scale detection of environmental changes, including those influenced by cyanobacterial activity, such as marine debris and water quality degradation [10]. These studies highlight the importance of high-resolution, temporally consistent data in understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of cyanobacteria in aquatic systems. Machine learning has emerged as a critical tool in analyzing complex environmental datasets, including those related to cyanobacterial growth and distribution. Studies have demonstrated that deep learning models, such as segmentation networks and capsule-based architectures, can effectively process multi-spectral and hyperspectral imagery to identify and classify cyanobacterial blooms with high accuracy [9]. These models benefit from well-structured datasets and careful preprocessing, which is a common theme across several recent works that emphasize the role of data engineering in improving model performance [7]. Techniques such as SMOTE for class imbalance and PCA for dimensionality reduction have been successfully applied in microbiome data, suggesting potential for similar approaches in cyanobacterial data analysis [6]. The environmental impact of machine learning models has also become a focal point in the broader context of sustainability. While deep learning offers superior performance, its energy consumption and computational demands raise concerns about ecological footprint, particularly in large-scale environmental monitoring applications [7]. This has led to a growing interest in optimizing models for efficiency without compromising accuracy, as seen in studies that compare traditional machine learning algorithms with deep learning approaches in industrial and environmental settings. The trade-off between model complexity and environmental impact is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in the development of sustainable AI systems for environmental science [7]. Another significant trend is the increasing use of open-source platforms and standardized benchmarks to facilitate reproducibility and collaboration. Projects such as ClimateLearn provide a framework for applying machine learning to weather and climate modeling, offering a template for similar initiatives in environmental microbiology [9]. These tools not only support scientific progress but also ensure that findings are transparent and accessible, enabling broader validation and application. The availability of datasets and codebases, as demonstrated in studies on marine debris detection and underwater image restoration, underscores the importance of shared resources in advancing cyanobacteria research [10]. The integration of machine learning with environmental monitoring systems has also led to innovations in real-time data analysis and decision-making. For instance, IoT-based air quality monitoring systems leverage machine learning to process and interpret data from multiple sensors, offering insights into environmental conditions that may influence cyanobacterial growth [8]. Such systems highlight the potential for real-time, data-driven approaches in managing environmental risks associated with cyanobacteria. In summary, the current state of the art in cyanobacteria research within environmental science is characterized by the convergence of advanced computational techniques, robust data engineering practices, and a growing emphasis on sustainability. The application of machine learning and remote sensing technologies has significantly enhanced the ability to monitor and predict cyanobacterial dynamics, while the focus on open-source tools and efficient models ensures that these advancements are both impactful and responsible. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of interdisciplinary approaches will be essential in addressing the complex challenges posed by cyanobacteria in natural and managed ecosystems.

## Future Directions

The future of cyanobacteria research in environmental science is poised to benefit from the integration of advanced computational methods, remote sensing technologies, and interdisciplinary approaches that bridge ecological, biochemical, and data science domains. As the field evolves, several key directions are emerging that reflect the current state of research and the potential for innovation. One prominent trend is the increasing emphasis on data-centric AI, where the design of high-quality, representative datasets plays a critical role in improving model performance. This is particularly relevant for applications such as environmental monitoring, where the accuracy of cyanobacteria detection and classification depends on the quality of training data, as demonstrated in marine debris detection studies [12], [10]. Similarly, the integration of domain-specific knowledge into machine learning models is gaining traction, as seen in the use of formulation graphs for mapping material properties to performance [11], which suggests that incorporating ecological and biochemical constraints into predictive models could enhance their interpretability and reliability for cyanobacteria-related applications. Another significant direction involves the development of hybrid modeling approaches that combine physical principles with data-driven methods. This is evident in the use of physics-constrained machine learning for land surface temperature estimation [13], where the integration of physical models with machine learning algorithms leads to more accurate and robust predictions. Applying similar strategies to cyanobacteria research could enable more reliable modeling of their growth dynamics, nutrient uptake, and interactions with the surrounding environment. Additionally, the use of attention mechanisms and advanced neural architectures, as explored in marine debris detection [12], may offer new opportunities for improving the accuracy of cyanobacteria detection in complex and heterogeneous environments, such as coastal waters or freshwater ecosystems. Remote sensing technologies, particularly satellite-based monitoring, are also expected to play an increasingly important role in the study of cyanobacteria. The success of deep learning models in detecting marine debris using Sentinel-2 data [10] highlights the potential of such technologies for large-scale environmental monitoring. By leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery and advanced image processing techniques, researchers can track cyanobacteria blooms, assess their ecological impact, and develop early warning systems for harmful algal blooms. This aligns with broader efforts in environmental science to use remote sensing for real-time monitoring and decision-making, as seen in studies on deforestation and land surface temperature mapping [14], [13]. Moreover, the growing awareness of environmental justice and sustainability is shaping the future of AI and data science in environmental research. Studies on geographical load balancing and equitable AI practices [15] emphasize the need to consider the environmental and social impacts of computational models. As cyanobacteria research becomes more data-intensive, it is essential to ensure that the development and deployment of AI-driven tools are not only technically sound but also environmentally responsible and socially equitable. This includes addressing the carbon footprint of large-scale models and ensuring that the benefits of AI-driven environmental monitoring are distributed fairly across different regions and communities. In summary, the future of cyanobacteria research in environmental science will likely involve a convergence of data-centric AI, hybrid modeling, remote sensing, and sustainability considerations. By drawing on insights from related fields, such as materials science, ecology, and environmental engineering, researchers can develop more accurate, interpretable, and socially responsible models for understanding and managing cyanobacteria in natural and anthropogenic systems. The continued exploration of these directions will not only advance scientific knowledge but also support the development of practical solutions for environmental monitoring and management.
