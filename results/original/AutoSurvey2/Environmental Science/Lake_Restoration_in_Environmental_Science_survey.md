## Background

Lake restoration has emerged as a critical area of research within environmental science, driven by the increasing degradation of freshwater ecosystems due to anthropogenic activities, climate change, and natural processes. The restoration of lakes involves a multidisciplinary approach that integrates hydrology, ecology, chemistry, and engineering to rehabilitate water quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Over the past few decades, the field has evolved from traditional methods, such as nutrient loading control and sediment management, to more sophisticated, data-driven strategies that leverage advanced computational techniques. This transformation has been largely influenced by the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and remote sensing technologies, which have enabled more accurate monitoring, modeling, and prediction of lake dynamics. The integration of these technologies has not only enhanced the precision of lake restoration efforts but also improved the ability to assess the long-term impacts of interventions. For instance, deep learning models have been employed to analyze satellite imagery and detect changes in water quality parameters, while generative models have been used to simulate the effects of various restoration scenarios. Moreover, the growing emphasis on multi-modal data fusion and hybrid architectures has allowed researchers to combine diverse data sources, such as in-situ measurements, remote sensing, and climate models, to develop more robust and interpretable restoration frameworks. The increasing availability of high-resolution spatial and temporal data has further facilitated the application of these techniques, enabling more detailed and localized assessments of lake ecosystems. However, despite these advancements, challenges remain, particularly in addressing data scarcity, ensuring model generalizability, and incorporating physical constraints to improve the reliability of predictions. As the field continues to evolve, there is a need for more comprehensive studies that bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical implementation, ensuring that lake restoration strategies are both scientifically sound and environmentally sustainable. The integration of AI and data science into lake restoration not only reflects the broader trend of digitalization in environmental research but also underscores the potential for technology to play a pivotal role in the conservation and management of freshwater resources.

## Current State of the Art

The current state of the art in lake restoration within environmental science is marked by a growing integration of advanced computational techniques and interdisciplinary approaches aimed at addressing the complex ecological, hydrological, and biogeochemical challenges associated with water body degradation. Recent research has demonstrated a shift from traditional restoration methods, which often rely on physical interventions and chemical treatments, to more data-driven and model-based strategies that leverage machine learning, remote sensing, and simulation technologies. This evolution is evident in the development of novel methodologies for environmental monitoring, predictive modeling, and data synthesis, which are increasingly being applied to lake systems to improve restoration outcomes. One of the key developments in this field is the use of deep learning and neural network-based models to enhance environmental data analysis. Techniques such as neural radiance fields (NeRF) and neuS, as demonstrated in the work of [5], have shown promise in reconstructing complex 3D structures from limited input data, which can be adapted for modeling aquatic environments. Similarly, the application of stable diffusion and control networks, as seen in [1], has enabled the generation of synthetic underwater images, addressing the challenge of data scarcity in aquatic studies. These methods are not only useful for visualizing lake ecosystems but also for training models that can detect changes in water quality and habitat conditions over time. Another significant trend is the use of machine learning to predict and understand biogeochemical processes that affect lake health. For example, the work in [4] on mineralization processes in geologic carbon sequestration has provided insights into how reactive transport models can be used to simulate and predict the behavior of dissolved substances in aquatic systems. Such models are crucial for understanding nutrient cycling, contaminant dispersion, and the long-term stability of restored lake environments. These findings underscore the importance of integrating geochemical and hydrological modeling into lake restoration frameworks. In addition, the application of image processing and restoration techniques has gained traction in environmental science. Methods such as those described in [6] for removing visible watermarks and [3] for rain streak removal have been adapted to enhance the quality of remote sensing and in-situ imagery used in lake monitoring. These techniques improve the accuracy of data interpretation, enabling more reliable assessments of water clarity, algal blooms, and sediment distribution. The use of dual-path networks and global-local context interaction modules, as proposed in [6], highlights the potential of deep learning in handling complex image restoration tasks that are relevant to environmental monitoring. Furthermore, the increasing use of simulation-based approaches in environmental science reflects a broader trend toward predictive modeling. Papers such as [2], which explore physics-informed generative adversarial networks for wind field super-resolution, demonstrate how simulation techniques can be extended to model hydrodynamic processes in lakes. These models are essential for predicting the impacts of climate change, land-use changes, and human activities on lake ecosystems. The ability to simulate and forecast environmental conditions allows for more proactive and adaptive restoration strategies. The interdisciplinary nature of current research is also evident in the application of evolutionary algorithms and genetic programming to environmental problems. The work in [7], for instance, illustrates how techniques from computer science can be applied to optimize restoration planning and resource allocation. Similarly, the use of liquid state genetic programming, as described in [8], offers a novel approach to handling complex optimization tasks in environmental modeling, suggesting that hybrid methods can enhance the performance of traditional restoration techniques. Overall, the current state of the art in lake restoration is characterized by a convergence of computational methods, environmental science, and data-driven modeling. The integration of these approaches has led to more accurate, efficient, and scalable solutions for addressing the challenges of lake degradation. As research continues to evolve, the focus is likely to shift toward more integrated and adaptive systems that combine real-time data, predictive analytics, and ecological knowledge to support sustainable lake restoration efforts.

## Future Directions

The future of lake restoration in environmental science is increasingly intertwined with advancements in image processing, data analysis, and machine learning. As the field moves beyond traditional ecological and hydrological approaches, there is a growing recognition of the potential of computational methods to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of lake restoration efforts. Recent developments in image restoration, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques, offer promising pathways for improving the monitoring, assessment, and management of lake ecosystems. For instance, the integration of generative adversarial networks (GANs) with multi-level attention mechanisms has demonstrated significant improvements in underwater image enhancement, which can be directly applied to remote sensing and in-situ monitoring of lake conditions [11]. Similarly, diffusion models with preconditioned guidance have introduced more robust and efficient methods for denoising and restoring degraded images, which could be valuable in processing satellite or drone-based data for lake health assessments [13]. These techniques not only enhance the visual quality of images but also improve the reliability of subsequent analyses, such as water quality monitoring or habitat mapping. Another critical development is the emergence of large language models (LLMs) tailored for geoscience applications, such as GeoGalactica, which has shown the potential of domain-specific pre-training and fine-tuning to improve the interpretation of environmental data [16]. While this paper focuses on geoscience, the principles of domain adaptation and knowledge transfer can be extended to environmental science, including lake restoration. By leveraging the power of LLMs, researchers could develop systems that automatically generate reports, interpret sensor data, or even suggest restoration strategies based on historical and real-time data. This could significantly reduce the time and expertise required for decision-making in lake management. Moreover, the fusion of generative and regression-based models, as seen in UGPNet, highlights the value of hybrid architectures in achieving high-fidelity image restoration [12]. Such approaches can be adapted to restore not only visual data but also other forms of environmental data, such as water quality indices or ecological indicators. The use of cross-modal techniques, as demonstrated in the paper on textual degradation removal, further expands the possibilities by enabling the integration of text-based information with image restoration tasks [15]. This could be particularly useful in scenarios where textual descriptions of lake conditions are available, and can be used to guide or enhance the restoration of visual data. In addition to image restoration, there is a growing emphasis on the development of efficient and scalable models. For example, the work on compressing deep image super-resolution models demonstrates the importance of model efficiency, especially when deploying restoration techniques in resource-constrained environments [17]. As lake restoration efforts expand to cover larger and more diverse regions, the need for lightweight and adaptable models becomes increasingly critical. This is further supported by the trend towards microservice-based architectures, as seen in the paper on multi-hazard early warning systems, which suggests that modular and distributed systems could be beneficial for real-time lake monitoring and restoration applications [9]. The application of deep learning in landslide detection and segmentation using remote sensing images also provides a relevant analogy for lake restoration. By leveraging deep neural networks, researchers have been able to identify and classify environmental changes with high accuracy [14]. This approach could be adapted to detect and monitor changes in lake ecosystems, such as sedimentation, algal blooms, or shoreline erosion, enabling more proactive and targeted restoration efforts. Similarly, the use of debiased learning techniques in remote sensing data could help mitigate biases in environmental datasets, leading to more accurate and reliable models for lake restoration [10]. Looking ahead, the integration of multiple modalities—such as images, text, and sensor data—will likely play a central role in the next generation of lake restoration technologies. The ability to process and analyze diverse data sources will enable more comprehensive and holistic approaches to environmental management. Furthermore, the increasing availability of high-resolution and high-frequency data from satellites, drones, and in-situ sensors will provide the necessary input for these models, allowing for more frequent and detailed assessments of lake conditions. As these technologies continue to evolve, the future of lake restoration will be shaped not only by ecological knowledge but also by the innovative application of computational methods.
