      "content": "The concept of digital entrepreneurship has gained significant traction as a critical driver of innovation and sustainable development in the modern era. As societies transition toward more environmentally conscious and technologically advanced systems, the role of digital entrepreneurship in shaping these transitions has become increasingly prominent. Digital entrepreneurship refers to the process of identifying and exploiting opportunities through digital technologies, often involving the creation of new business models, products, and services that leverage digital platforms and data-driven insights. This form of entrepreneurship is particularly relevant in the context of innovation systems, where the integration of digital technologies can catalyze systemic change and support the goals of sustainability. The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and edge computing has further expanded the possibilities for digital entrepreneurs to innovate and contribute to sustainable transitions. Recent research has highlighted the importance of rethinking traditional software engineering practices to accommodate the unique characteristics of ML systems, which are inherently non-deterministic and require new approaches to testing, validation, and deployment [12]. Similarly, the integration of AI at the edge has emerged as a key enabler for real-time applications, such as autonomous vehicles and immersive technologies, which demand low-latency and high-reliability systems [9]. These developments underscore the need for robust and adaptive frameworks that can support the complex interplay between digital technologies and traditional systems. In addition to technical advancements, the societal and ethical implications of AI and digital technologies have become a central concern in the discourse around digital entrepreneurship. Studies emphasize the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science, engineering, and social sciences to address the broader impacts of AI on society, including issues of bias, inequality, and privacy [10]. This calls for a more holistic approach to digital innovation, where the design and deployment of digital solutions are guided not only by technical feasibility but also by ethical and societal considerations. The development of ontologies and knowledge representation frameworks further illustrates the growing importance of structured and interoperable systems in supporting digital entrepreneurship. For instance, the creation of smart mobility ontologies aims to facilitate the integration of diverse mobility data sources, enabling more comprehensive and sustainable urban mobility solutions [14]. Such efforts highlight the role of digital entrepreneurship in fostering innovation through the development of shared knowledge infrastructures that can support cross-domain collaboration and system integration. Moreover, the increasing emphasis on empirical and industrial validation in digital entrepreneurship underscores the need for real-world experimentation and case studies to evaluate the effectiveness of new digital solutions. Research in this area has called for more rigorous testing and validation of AI and ML systems in practical contexts, ensuring that they align with the needs of users and the broader goals of sustainability [12]. This aligns with the growing trend of human-in-the-loop approaches, where human oversight and intervention play a critical role in refining and improving digital systems [11]. As the field of digital entrepreneurship continues to evolve, it is clear that its success depends on a combination of technical innovation, ethical considerations, and interdisciplinary collaboration. The integration of AI, edge computing, and ontological frameworks into digital business models and systems represents a significant step toward achieving sustainable transitions. However, the challenges associated with these technologies—ranging from technical complexity to societal impact—require ongoing research and development to ensure that digital entrepreneurship contributes positively to the broader goals of innovation and sustainability."

      "content": "The current state of the art in digital entrepreneurship within innovation systems for sustainable transitions reveals a rapidly evolving landscape shaped by the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), game theory, and advanced computational models. Researchers are increasingly focusing on how digital technologies can be leveraged to drive systemic change, particularly in urban environments, energy systems, and mobility solutions. A central theme across the literature is the recognition that technological advancements alone are insufficient; they must be accompanied by robust governance frameworks, ethical considerations, and interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure sustainable and equitable outcomes. For instance, the development of human-centered smart cities underscores the necessity of balancing technological innovation with policy and institutional support to address security, interpretability, and ethical challenges [15]. This highlights a growing awareness that the success of digital entrepreneurship in urban contexts depends not only on the sophistication of AI systems but also on the strength of the socio-institutional environment in which they operate. Another significant trend is the increasing use of game-theoretic models to understand and optimize interactions between agents in complex systems. Papers such as \"Data Sharing Games\" and \"Evolutionary Game Theory Squared\" demonstrate how strategic interactions can be modeled to promote cooperation and efficiency in data sharing and resource allocation [14], [13]. These approaches are particularly relevant in the context of digital entrepreneurship, where multiple stakeholders—ranging from entrepreneurs to policymakers—must navigate competing interests and incentives. The application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in urban energy management, as exemplified by the CityLearn platform, further illustrates the potential of computational models to support decentralized decision-making and system-level optimization [16]. Such platforms not only advance research but also provide practical tools for testing and implementing sustainable solutions. Interoperability and standardization have emerged as critical enablers of digital entrepreneurship in innovation systems. The lack of unified ontologies in mobility and energy systems, as noted in the literature, underscores the need for structured knowledge representation to facilitate integration and scalability [14]. Similarly, the development of standardized research environments like CityLearn highlights the importance of shared infrastructure in advancing collaborative and reproducible research. These efforts reflect a broader movement toward creating open, accessible, and interoperable digital ecosystems that support innovation and sustainability. Moreover, the ethical and societal implications of digital technologies are receiving increasing attention. Papers that emphasize the need for responsible AI development, such as those discussing security, interpretability, and ethical challenges in smart cities, signal a shift toward more holistic and inclusive approaches to digital entrepreneurship [15]. This trend aligns with the growing recognition that sustainable transitions require not only technological solutions but also a deep understanding of their social and environmental impacts. In summary, the current state of the art in digital entrepreneurship within innovation systems for sustainable transitions is characterized by a convergence of technical, ethical, and institutional considerations. While advancements in AI, game theory, and computational modeling are driving new possibilities, the integration of these technologies into real-world systems requires careful attention to governance, ethics, and interoperability. The field is moving toward a more interdisciplinary and human-centered approach, where the success of digital innovation is measured not only by technical performance but also by its contribution to sustainable and equitable societal outcomes."

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The future of digital entrepreneurship within innovation systems for sustainable transitions is poised at the intersection of technological advancement, ethical considerations, and systemic adaptability. As the landscape of digital technologies continues to evolve, the integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and autonomous systems into entrepreneurial ventures is becoming increasingly critical. This evolution necessitates a rethinking of traditional innovation models, where digital entrepreneurship is not just a driver of economic growth but also a key player in achieving sustainability goals. The insights from recent research suggest that future directions in this field must address the challenges of scalability, adaptability, and ethical responsibility in an increasingly complex and interconnected world. One of the most pressing areas for future research is the development of adaptive and autonomous systems that can operate in dynamic and uncertain environments. The concept of Distributed Adaptive Control (DAC), as proposed in [17], offers a promising framework for managing complex systems such as robotic recycling plants. This approach emphasizes the need for recursive and scalable control mechanisms that can respond to real-time changes. Future work could explore how such systems can be integrated into broader innovation ecosystems, enabling digital entrepreneurs to create more resilient and sustainable business models. Moreover, the application of DAC principles to other domains, such as smart cities or circular economies, presents an opportunity for cross-disciplinary collaboration and innovation. Another significant theme that emerges from the literature is the need for a deeper understanding of the adaptive cycles and resilience mechanisms within social-ecological systems. The panarchy framework, as discussed in [20], provides a conceptual lens through which to analyze the interactions between different levels of complexity. Future research should focus on empirical validation of these theoretical models, particularly in the context of digital entrepreneurship. By grounding panarchy in real-world case studies, researchers can develop more actionable insights for entrepreneurs seeking to navigate the uncertainties of sustainable transitions. The emergence of digital me, as described in [21], highlights the ethical and ontological challenges associated with autonomous AI agents. As digital entrepreneurship increasingly involves AI-driven decision-making, the development of normative frameworks that guide the behavior of these agents becomes essential. Future work should explore how to embed ethical principles into the design of AI systems, ensuring that they align with societal values and contribute to sustainable outcomes. This includes the establishment of thresholds for digital me development, such as the transition from rudimentary consciousness to moral learning, which could inform the creation of more responsible and transparent AI systems. In addition, the integration of reinforcement learning (RL) with safety constraints, as demonstrated in [19], underscores the importance of developing robust and reliable algorithms for digital entrepreneurs. The concept of assured RL, which incorporates barrier-based decomposition and constraint satisfaction, offers a pathway to ensure that AI-driven systems operate within safe and ethical boundaries. Future research should focus on extending these methods to multi-agent and multi-objective scenarios, where the coordination of autonomous systems is critical for achieving sustainable outcomes. This includes the development of frameworks that allow for real-time adaptation while maintaining compliance with regulatory and ethical standards. The role of policy and regulation in shaping the trajectory of digital entrepreneurship cannot be overlooked. The analysis of AI development races in [22] suggests that heterogeneous settings require tailored approaches to minimize conflicts and promote equitable growth. Future work should investigate how regulatory frameworks can be designed to support innovation while ensuring that the benefits of digital entrepreneurship are distributed fairly. This includes the use of machine learning and automation in compliance generation, as explored in [18], to streamline regulatory processes and enhance transparency. Moreover, the interdisciplinary nature of digital entrepreneurship necessitates a holistic approach that combines technical, social, and ethical perspectives. The integration of semantic modeling, as discussed in [23], and the use of ontological patterns, as outlined in [24], can enhance the interoperability and coherence of digital systems. Future research should explore how these methods can be leveraged to create more integrated and sustainable innovation ecosystems. This includes the development of shared knowledge infrastructures that support collaboration between entrepreneurs, researchers, and policymakers. In conclusion, the future of digital entrepreneurship in innovation systems for sustainable transitions will be shaped by the interplay of technological, ethical, and systemic factors. The insights from recent studies highlight the need for adaptive and autonomous systems, ethical AI frameworks, and robust regulatory mechanisms. As the field continues to evolve, interdisciplinary collaboration and empirical validation will be essential in ensuring that digital entrepreneurship contributes meaningfully to the goals of sustainability and social responsibility. The path forward requires not only technical innovation but also a deep commitment to creating systems that are resilient, equitable, and aligned with the needs of future generations."
