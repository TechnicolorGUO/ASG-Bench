Moreover, the development of innovative diagnostic tools, such as AI-based imaging and microfluidic technologies, underscores the importance of integrating diverse methodologies to improve patient outcomes [1]. While these advancements are largely rooted in Western biomedical frameworks, they also highlight the potential for complementary systems like TCM to contribute to a more holistic understanding of disease and treatment. The role of TCM in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections is not without challenges. One of the primary concerns is the lack of standardized, large-scale clinical trials that can provide robust evidence of its efficacy and safety. This contrasts with the rigorous scientific validation processes that dominate contemporary medical research. Nonetheless, the increasing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in healthcare offers new opportunities for TCM research, enabling more systematic analysis of herbal formulations, treatment protocols, and patient outcomes [3]. These technological advancements may also facilitate the personalization of TCM treatments, aligning with the growing trend toward precision medicine. Another important consideration is the communication and public perception of TCM during public health crises. The pandemic has demonstrated how language, both scientific and emotional, can influence public engagement and trust in health interventions [2]. While Western medical approaches have dominated public discourse, TCM's traditional knowledge base and cultural significance offer a unique perspective that may resonate with specific patient populations. However, the lack of widespread recognition and integration of TCM into mainstream healthcare systems remains a barrier to its broader acceptance and application. In summary, the intersection of TCM and SARS-CoV-2 treatment represents a complex and evolving field of research. While TCM's holistic and preventive approach holds promise, its integration into modern healthcare requires further scientific validation, interdisciplinary collaboration, and a nuanced understanding of its cultural and clinical relevance. As the global health landscape continues to evolve, the contributions of TCM in addressing the challenges posed by SARS-CoV-2 warrant careful examination and continued exploration."

      "content": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has long been an integral part of healthcare in China and other Asian countries, offering a holistic approach to diagnosis and treatment based on principles such as yin-yang balance, the five elements, and the flow of qi. In recent years, the global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has prompted renewed interest in exploring the potential of TCM in managing and treating the disease. While Western medicine has dominated the response to the pandemic, TCM has been increasingly studied for its role in alleviating symptoms, enhancing immune response, and reducing the severity of infections. This has led to a growing body of research on the efficacy, mechanisms, and applications of TCM in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The integration of TCM into modern medical practices has been facilitated by advancements in data science and artificial intelligence, which have enabled more systematic analysis of traditional remedies and their interactions with the human body. For instance, the development of specialized datasets such as TCMD has provided a foundation for evaluating the performance of large language models in TCM-related tasks, highlighting the need for domain-specific models that can accurately interpret and apply traditional medical knowledge [4]. Additionally, the application of machine learning techniques in healthcare has opened new avenues for understanding the complex relationships between TCM treatments and patient outcomes. Approaches such as Dynamic Uncertain Causality Graph (DUCG) have demonstrated the potential of explainable models in clinical diagnosis, offering a framework that could be adapted to analyze TCM-based interventions [6]. Similarly, the use of deep learning and counterfactual prediction models, as seen in G-Transformer, underscores the importance of developing robust methods for evaluating the effectiveness of dynamic treatment regimes, including those involving TCM [5]. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the integration of TCM into mainstream medical research, particularly in terms of data availability, standardization, and validation. Many studies have pointed to the scarcity of high-quality, annotated datasets that can support the training and evaluation of models in the TCM domain, a challenge that is also evident in other specialized areas of healthcare, such as speech recognition and medical imaging [6]. Furthermore, the complexity of TCM treatments, which often involve combinations of herbs, acupuncture, and lifestyle modifications, presents a unique challenge for modeling and prediction. As a result, there is a growing need for interdisciplinary approaches that combine traditional knowledge with modern computational techniques to improve the accuracy, transparency, and applicability of TCM in clinical settings. The evolving landscape of medical AI and data science continues to shape the way TCM is studied and applied, offering new opportunities for innovation and collaboration across different fields of medicine."

      "content": "The current state of the art in the application of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections is an area of growing interest, particularly as researchers seek complementary and alternative approaches to conventional therapies. While TCM has long been used in the management of respiratory illnesses, its role in addressing the unique challenges posed by SARS-CoV-2 has been increasingly scrutinized through modern scientific and computational methods. Recent advances in biomedical AI and machine learning have provided new tools for evaluating the efficacy, mechanisms, and potential applications of TCM in the context of viral infections, including those caused by SARS-CoV-2. One of the key developments in this area is the integration of deep learning and graph-based models to analyze the complex interactions between TCM formulations and biological pathways. For instance, models such as PANDORA, which employs deep graph learning for infection risk forecasting, offer insights into how TCM compounds may influence disease progression by incorporating geographical, socio-economic, and biological factors into predictive frameworks [7]. These approaches highlight the potential for TCM to be studied through a systems biology lens, where the holistic effects of herbal treatments are modeled alongside conventional biomedical data. Another significant trend is the use of advanced image reconstruction and generation techniques to evaluate the physiological effects of TCM treatments. For example, the application of 2.5D multi-view averaging diffusion models for 3D medical image translation has demonstrated the ability to reconstruct low-count PET images with high fidelity, which could be instrumental in assessing the impact of TCM on metabolic and inflammatory processes in the body [10]. Similarly, improvements in cone beam CT reconstruction using SwinIR-based sinogram enhancement suggest that AI-driven image processing can aid in the non-invasive monitoring of TCM-induced changes in lung and immune system structures [9]. In the realm of drug discovery, entropy-reinforced planning with large language models has shown promise in generating novel molecular structures that could be derived from TCM ingredients. This approach, which balances exploration and exploitation during molecule generation, has demonstrated improvements in the identification of potential antiviral compounds, particularly for targets such as SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro [8]. Such methods provide a bridge between traditional herbal knowledge and modern computational drug discovery, enabling the systematic evaluation of TCM components for their antiviral properties. The evaluation of TCM treatments is also evolving, with a growing emphasis on practical metrics beyond traditional docking scores or in vitro assays. The SBDD paper, for instance, advocates for the use of real-world performance indicators such as compound similarity to active drugs and virtual screening efficacy, which can be applied to assess the potential of TCM-derived molecules in clinical settings [12]. This shift reflects a broader movement toward evidence-based validation of TCM, aligning it more closely with the standards of modern pharmacology. Moreover, the application of AI in healthcare has expanded the scope of TCM research, particularly in the context of personalized treatment and disease management. Techniques such as inverse probability of treatment weighting with deep sequence models have been used to estimate treatment effects from electronic health records, offering a framework for analyzing the outcomes of TCM interventions in real-world populations [11]. Similarly, the use of chain-of-thought prompting strategies in medical error detection and correction highlights the potential for AI to support the safe and effective integration of TCM into clinical practice [13]. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the systematic evaluation and standardization of TCM for SARS-CoV-2 treatment. The complexity of TCM formulations, which often consist of multiple herbs with synergistic effects, requires sophisticated modeling approaches to disentangle individual contributions. Additionally, the lack of large-scale, well-controlled clinical trials limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy of TCM in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections. In conclusion, the current state of the art in TCM research for SARS-CoV-2 reflects a dynamic interplay between traditional knowledge and modern computational methods. The integration of deep learning, graph-based modeling, and AI-driven image processing has opened new avenues for understanding the mechanisms and potential of TCM in combating viral infections. As these technologies continue to evolve, they offer the promise of more rigorous, data-driven approaches to evaluating and applying TCM in the context of global health challenges."

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The future directions for research on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections should build on the growing integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in healthcare. As demonstrated by recent studies, data-driven approaches have significantly enhanced the ability to analyze complex medical data, offering new insights into disease mechanisms and treatment outcomes. For instance, the application of Bayesian networks and machine learning in classifying COVID-19 severity and demographic symptoms has shown remarkable accuracy, suggesting that similar methodologies could be employed to evaluate the efficacy of TCM interventions [17]. By leveraging these techniques, researchers could develop more precise models for predicting treatment responses and identifying patient subgroups that may benefit most from TCM therapies. Moreover, the success of hybrid deep learning models in tasks such as Twitter sentiment classification and biomedical natural language processing highlights the potential for combining multiple machine learning techniques to improve diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. These models, which integrate BERT, CNN, and other architectures, have demonstrated robust performance in handling complex and noisy data, a characteristic that is particularly relevant in the context of pandemic-related information [15]. Applying such models to TCM research could facilitate the analysis of patient-reported outcomes, treatment adherence, and symptom progression, providing a more comprehensive understanding of TCM's role in SARS-CoV-2 management. Another critical area for future research is the development of robust and reliable benchmarks for evaluating TCM treatments. The creation of large-scale, manually annotated datasets, such as the Clinical Trial Outcomes (CTO) benchmark, has set a precedent for ensuring the quality and reproducibility of research findings [16]. In the context of TCM, such benchmarks could be used to assess the effectiveness of herbal formulations, acupuncture, and other therapeutic modalities, enabling comparisons with conventional treatments and promoting evidence-based practice. Additionally, the use of pre-trained language models, as seen in studies on misinformation detection and robustness testing, could be extended to TCM research to evaluate the reliability of information sources and detect potential biases in treatment reporting. The growing interest in large language models (LLMs) for healthcare applications also presents new opportunities for TCM research. While some studies have shown that general-purpose LLMs can outperform specialized medical models in certain tasks, the need for domain-specific fine-tuning remains critical [14]. This suggests that future work should focus on developing TCM-specific language models that can accurately process and interpret traditional medical texts, patient records, and clinical trial data. Such models could support the development of decision-support systems, automated diagnosis tools, and personalized treatment recommendations, thereby enhancing the integration of TCM into modern healthcare frameworks. Furthermore, the increasing emphasis on multimodal and multilingual applications in healthcare research underscores the importance of considering the linguistic and cultural context of TCM. As highlighted by studies on Chinese healthcare benchmarks, the adaptation of AI models to different languages and medical traditions is essential for ensuring their applicability and generalizability [14]. This calls for the development of TCM-focused datasets and tools that are accessible and relevant to both Chinese and global audiences, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange across disciplines. Finally, the future of TCM in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections should also address the challenges of model interpretability and ethical considerations. As seen in studies on medical report generation and lesion tracking, the ability to explain model decisions is crucial for building trust and ensuring responsible AI use in healthcare [18]. Future research should prioritize the development of transparent and interpretable models that can provide clear rationales for treatment recommendations, thereby supporting informed decision-making by both clinicians and patients. In this way, TCM can be integrated more effectively into the broader landscape of evidence-based medicine, contributing to the global effort to combat infectious diseases."
