## Introduction

The study of social determinants of health (SDOH) has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in the context of chronic diseases such as diabetes. As researchers continue to explore the complex interplay between socioeconomic, environmental, and behavioral factors and health outcomes, the integration of advanced computational methods has become essential. This survey paper examines the evolving landscape of diabetes research, with a particular focus on how social determinants influence disease progression, management, and outcomes. By analyzing recent advancements in health prediction, data curation, and machine learning applications, this paper highlights the critical role that contextual and domain-specific information plays in improving health outcomes for diabetic patients. Several studies have demonstrated that leveraging wearable sensor data can enhance health prediction models, with large language models (LLMs) showing strong performance in tasks such as disease risk assessment and health monitoring [4]. These models benefit significantly from incorporating demographic and health-related context, which can improve their accuracy and reliability. In addition to technological advancements, there is a growing recognition of the biases embedded in pretraining data, particularly in how they affect the representation of diverse populations [3]. This highlights the importance of developing more inclusive and representative datasets that reflect the social and geographic diversity of the populations being studied. Wearable devices and sensor technologies have also been instrumental in capturing real-time physiological and emotional data, offering new opportunities for understanding the impact of psychological and social factors on health [2]. These insights can be used to inform personalized interventions and improve patient care. Furthermore, the development of deep learning approaches for medical imaging, such as those used in diabetic retinopathy diagnosis, underscores the potential of artificial intelligence to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce healthcare disparities [1]. At the same time, the need for reproducible and scalable data infrastructure has become a key priority, as seen in the use of cloud platforms and big data tools to process large-scale health datasets [5]. These efforts not only improve the efficiency of research but also ensure that findings are more generalizable and applicable across different populations. The integration of social determinants into health research requires interdisciplinary collaboration, combining insights from computer science, public health, and social sciences. As the field continues to evolve, it is clear that addressing the social determinants of health is not only a scientific imperative but also a moral and ethical responsibility. By leveraging advanced computational tools and fostering inclusive data practices, researchers can make significant strides toward more equitable and effective diabetes care.

## Background

The study of social determinants of health has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in the context of chronic diseases such as diabetes. Social determinants, including socioeconomic status, education, neighborhood environment, and access to healthcare, play a critical role in shaping health outcomes and disparities. Understanding these factors is essential for developing targeted interventions and policies that address the root causes of health inequities. In diabetes research, the interplay between social determinants and health outcomes has been increasingly explored, with growing recognition of the need for interdisciplinary approaches that integrate social, behavioral, and clinical data. Recent advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence have further expanded the possibilities for analyzing complex datasets and uncovering hidden patterns that traditional methods may overlook. For instance, studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) can effectively detect depressive symptoms in social media text, revealing insights into mental health challenges that are often underreported in clinical settings [6]. Similarly, research on personality trait inference using mobile phone sensor data has demonstrated the potential of behavioral data in understanding individual differences that may influence health behaviors and outcomes [10]. These developments highlight the growing importance of data-driven methodologies in health research, particularly in the context of social determinants. Moreover, the use of causal machine learning has provided new tools for analyzing treatment heterogeneity and moderating effects, which are crucial for understanding how different populations respond to interventions [8]. This is especially relevant in diabetes research, where variations in treatment response can be influenced by a wide range of social and environmental factors. The integration of diverse data sources, such as electronic health records, social media, and sensor data, has enabled more comprehensive analyses of health determinants. However, such approaches also raise important ethical and methodological challenges, including issues of privacy, bias, and fairness. For example, the use of differential privacy in adaptive experiment design has shown how it is possible to balance statistical power with ethical considerations in clinical research [7]. Similarly, studies have highlighted the need for careful mitigation of biases in datasets, particularly when analyzing vulnerable populations [11]. These insights underscore the importance of developing transparent and equitable methodologies in health research. As the field continues to evolve, the convergence of social science, data science, and clinical research will be critical in advancing our understanding of how social determinants influence diabetes outcomes and in designing interventions that are both effective and equitable. The growing availability of large-scale datasets, combined with advances in machine learning and causal inference, offers new opportunities for exploring the complex relationships between social factors and health, paving the way for more personalized and context-sensitive approaches to diabetes care.

## Current State of the Art

The current state of the art in social determinants of health (SDOH) research within the context of diabetes has seen significant advancements, driven by the integration of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. These innovations have enabled more nuanced understandings of how socioeconomic, environmental, and behavioral factors influence diabetes outcomes, while also addressing challenges related to data privacy, fairness, and real-world applicability. A growing body of literature highlights the importance of personalized and context-aware interventions, emphasizing the need to move beyond one-size-fits-all approaches in health care delivery. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of synthetic data generation techniques, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) enhanced with differential privacy, to preserve individual privacy while maintaining the utility of health data for research and model training [15]. This is particularly relevant in the context of diabetes research, where sensitive health data must be handled with care. Additionally, the use of mobile phone sensors for personality trait inference has opened new avenues for understanding behavioral patterns that may influence health-related decision-making and adherence to treatment regimens [10]. These behavioral indicators can be leveraged to develop more accurate and personalized health interventions, especially for individuals with diabetes who may face unique challenges related to SDOH. In the realm of subgroup analysis, novel frameworks have been developed to evaluate heterogeneous treatment effects in randomized controlled trials, particularly for time-to-event outcomes [13]. Such methods are crucial for identifying subpopulations that may benefit differently from diabetes interventions, thereby enabling more targeted and equitable health care strategies. Similarly, the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) in health nudging systems has shown promise in improving health outcomes through personalized, algorithmic recommendations [12]. These systems can be tailored to individual needs, taking into account social and environmental factors that influence health behaviors. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has also emerged as a powerful tool for dynamic health monitoring, particularly in activity-aware systems that optimize data collection and reduce unnecessary surveillance [12]. This approach is especially valuable in diabetes management, where continuous monitoring can provide real-time insights into patient behavior and health status. Furthermore, the development of benchmarking tools and open-source frameworks has facilitated the systematic evaluation of subgroup analysis methods, promoting transparency and reproducibility in research [13]. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in ensuring that AI and ML models used in diabetes research are fair, transparent, and free from bias. Several studies have highlighted the importance of addressing hidden biases in regression models and promoting balanced representation in datasets [11]. This is critical in the context of SDOH, where marginalized populations may be disproportionately affected by health disparities. Techniques such as debiasing graph neural networks and constrained optimization for interventional fairness have been proposed to mitigate these issues [14]. The integration of AI into health systems also raises important questions about the readiness of scientific data for fair and transparent use in machine learning [9]. As the field continues to evolve, there is a growing recognition of the need to develop models that not only perform well but also align with ethical and societal values. This includes ensuring that AI-driven interventions do not exacerbate existing health inequities and that they are accessible to all populations, regardless of socioeconomic status. In summary, the current state of the art in social determinants of health research within diabetes highlights the transformative potential of AI and ML in improving health outcomes. However, it also underscores the need for continued innovation in areas such as data privacy, fairness, and real-world applicability. As the field moves forward, interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists, health researchers, and policymakers will be essential to ensure that these technologies are used in ways that promote equity and improve the lives of individuals affected by diabetes.

## Future Directions

The future of research on social determinants of health in diabetes must integrate advanced computational methods with a deep understanding of the sociocultural and economic factors that shape health outcomes. As demonstrated by recent studies, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have the potential to transform how we detect, monitor, and intervene in diabetes-related conditions. However, the ethical and practical challenges of deploying these technologies in real-world settings remain significant. For instance, the generation of synthetic health data using GANs and differential privacy (DP) offers a promising approach to address privacy concerns while maintaining data utility [15]. This technique not only supports the development of robust models but also enables broader access to health data, which is essential for studying disparities across different populations. At the same time, the increasing reliance on AI in healthcare raises critical questions about bias and fairness. Studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) can perpetuate racial biases in medical report generation [18], highlighting the need for rigorous bias detection and mitigation strategies. These concerns are particularly relevant in the context of diabetes research, where social determinants such as race, income, and education significantly influence disease risk and management. The integration of multimodal data, including text, sensor signals, and geospatial information, is another emerging trend that can enhance our understanding of health disparities. For example, the use of BERT and wearable sensors for continuous emotion tracking [17] demonstrates how AI can be used to monitor mental health, a key social determinant that affects diabetes outcomes. Similarly, the application of transfer learning in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy [19] illustrates the potential of deep learning to improve diagnostic accuracy and accessibility, especially in resource-limited settings. However, the effectiveness of these models depends on the quality and representativeness of the data used for training. As noted in studies on synthetic data quality [16], ensuring that generated data reflects the diversity of real-world populations is crucial for developing equitable healthcare solutions. Moreover, the development of multilingual and culturally adapted models, such as the Longformer fine-tuned for depression classification in English and Luganda [20], underscores the importance of inclusivity in AI research. These approaches not only improve model performance but also help bridge the gap in healthcare access for underrepresented communities. Looking ahead, future research should focus on creating more transparent and interpretable AI systems that can be trusted by both clinicians and patients. The use of reinforcement learning and online activity prediction models [21] suggests that adaptive and personalized interventions may become more feasible, allowing for tailored diabetes management strategies that account for individual social contexts. Additionally, the exploration of geospatial disparities, such as those seen in real estate prices in Paris [22], highlights the need for spatially aware models that can identify and address localized health inequities. Ultimately, the integration of AI and social determinants research must be guided by a commitment to fairness, equity, and patient-centered care. By leveraging the latest advances in data science while remaining sensitive to the ethical and societal implications of AI, researchers can develop more effective and inclusive solutions for diabetes and other chronic conditions.
