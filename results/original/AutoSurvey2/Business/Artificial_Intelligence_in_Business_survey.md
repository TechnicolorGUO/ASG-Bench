Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increasingly become a transformative force across various domains, with its influence on business operations becoming particularly pronounced in recent years. The integration of AI into business processes has led to significant advancements in decision-making, process optimization, and predictive analytics, reshaping traditional operational models. As businesses seek to leverage data-driven insights, AI technologies have evolved from mere tools for automation to sophisticated systems capable of enabling intelligent and adaptive decision-making. This transformation is evident in areas such as predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization, customer behavior analysis, and legal reasoning, where AI not only enhances efficiency but also introduces new challenges related to ethics, transparency, and accountability. The growing body of research in this field highlights the shift from correlation-based analysis to causal inference, as businesses recognize the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms driving outcomes. For instance, studies have demonstrated that traditional action rules derived from correlations can be misleading, and that causal machine learning techniques, such as uplift trees, offer more reliable insights for business decisions [6]. This shift underscores the need for more robust and interpretable models that can support complex business environments. Furthermore, the ethical implications of AI in business have gained increasing attention, particularly as AI systems become more autonomous and capable of making decisions with significant consequences. Research on the impact of AI on legal principles and justice has emphasized the need for frameworks that ensure AI systems align with ethical and societal values, especially as they take on more autonomous roles in decision-making processes [3]. This raises important questions about accountability, fairness, and the potential for AI to either uphold or undermine existing legal and ethical standards. In parallel, the integration of AI with emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data analytics has enabled the development of smart and intelligent systems that can adapt in real-time to changing conditions. For example, AI-driven predictive maintenance systems have evolved into intelligent maintenance frameworks that leverage IIoT and deep learning to optimize equipment reliability and reduce downtime [5]. Similarly, AI-based modeling in smart manufacturing has demonstrated the potential to enhance data management and process optimization through the use of evolutionary computing and deep learning techniques [4]. These developments illustrate how AI is not only improving operational efficiency but also enabling new paradigms of business intelligence and automation. At the same time, the application of AI in areas such as customer behavior prediction and platform design has sparked debates about the ethical implications of behavior modification through reinforcement learning. While such approaches can improve predictive accuracy, they also raise concerns about user autonomy and the potential for manipulation [2]. This highlights the broader challenge of balancing the benefits of AI with the need to maintain trust and transparency in business practices. Overall, the evolution of AI in business reflects a dynamic interplay between technological innovation, ethical considerations, and practical applications.
