## Background

Additive Manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, has emerged as a transformative technology with the potential to reshape traditional business models across various industries. Unlike conventional subtractive or formative manufacturing methods, AM enables the creation of complex geometries layer by layer, offering greater design flexibility, reduced material waste, and on-demand production capabilities. This shift in manufacturing paradigms has prompted a reevaluation of business strategies, supply chain structures, and value propositions, as companies seek to leverage the unique advantages of AM to enhance competitiveness and innovation. The integration of AM into business models is not merely a technological advancement but a strategic transformation that requires rethinking production, distribution, and customer engagement processes. Recent research has explored the broader implications of AM in the context of Industry 4.0, emphasizing the role of digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics, and machine learning (ML) in optimizing AM processes and enhancing decision-making [6]. These technologies facilitate real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and adaptive control, which are critical for achieving efficiency and quality in AM systems. Furthermore, the convergence of AM with data-driven approaches has led to the development of advanced simulation techniques, such as the Residual Gaussian Process, which enables efficient uncertainty quantification and multi-fidelity modeling in complex manufacturing scenarios [8]. This has opened new avenues for optimizing AM processes, reducing computational costs, and improving the reliability of predictive models. In addition, the application of deep learning in semiconductor manufacturing, as demonstrated by the use of inductive biases in etching process prediction, highlights the potential of AM to integrate with domain-specific knowledge and physical constraints, thereby enhancing accuracy and reducing reliance on expensive physical simulations [7]. Such advancements underscore the importance of interdisciplinary approaches that combine data science, engineering, and business strategy to fully realize the potential of AM in modern enterprises. The growing body of literature also highlights challenges such as data bias, model interpretability, and security concerns, which must be addressed to ensure the ethical and sustainable deployment of AM technologies in business models [6]. As AM continues to evolve, its impact on business models will likely extend beyond production to include new service-oriented paradigms, such as on-demand customization, distributed manufacturing, and product-as-a-service models. These developments call for a deeper understanding of how AM can be strategically integrated into business operations, supported by robust analytical tools and methodologies that enable informed decision-making and continuous improvement. The interplay between AM and emerging technologies such as generative models, active learning, and causal analytics further illustrates the dynamic nature of this field, where innovation in both technology and business strategy is essential for long-term success.

## Current State of the Art

The integration of additive manufacturing (AM) technology into business models has been a growing area of research, with a focus on leveraging advanced computational methods to optimize production processes, enhance customization, and improve supply chain flexibility. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of standardization, interpretability, and data-driven decision-making in the context of AM, reflecting broader trends in machine learning and artificial intelligence. For instance, the work on standardizing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for production scheduling problems has introduced a structured framework for describing production setups and RL designs, emphasizing the need for reproducible validation schemes to enhance the applicability of RL in industrial settings [12]. This aligns with the broader push for standardized methodologies in AM, which is crucial for ensuring consistency and scalability across different manufacturing environments. Interpretability and explainability have also emerged as critical factors in the adoption of AM technologies, particularly in scenarios where decision-making involves complex models. The application of explainable AI (XAI) methods in credit scoring has demonstrated that advanced tree-based models, such as gradient-boosted trees, can outperform traditional models while maintaining transparency, which is essential for gaining stakeholder trust [9]. Although not directly related to AM, this insight underscores the importance of model interpretability in business contexts where transparency is required for regulatory compliance and user acceptance. Similarly, the use of data-driven approaches in actuator selection for artificial muscle-powered robots has shown how machine learning can be applied to optimize component choices, reducing the burden on non-expert users and enabling more efficient design processes [10]. This data-centric approach is increasingly relevant in AM, where the ability to make informed decisions based on real-time data can significantly impact production outcomes. Efficiency in learning and adaptation has also been a key area of development, with methodologies such as contextual hypernetworks (CHN) demonstrating the potential for rapid model adaptation to new features with minimal data [11]. This capability is particularly valuable in AM, where the need for agile and responsive systems is paramount. The ability to adapt models quickly can facilitate the integration of new materials, design parameters, or production constraints, thereby enhancing the flexibility of business models that rely on AM. Furthermore, the emphasis on open access and accessibility in some studies highlights the importance of creating platforms that allow for the sharing of models, datasets, and tools, which can accelerate innovation and collaboration in the AM sector [10]. While there are differing viewpoints on the role of standardization versus flexibility, the consensus appears to be that a balanced approach is necessary. Some studies argue that the paper format itself is not the main barrier to research accessibility, but rather the broader incentives and structures within the academic publishing system [13]. This perspective suggests that efforts to improve the reproducibility and transparency of AM research should go beyond formatting and focus on systemic reforms. Similarly, the debate between black-box models and interpretable models underscores the need to strike a balance between model complexity and transparency, especially in business applications where decisions must be justified and understood by stakeholders. In summary, the current state of the art in additive manufacturing technology within business models reflects a dynamic interplay of technical innovation, methodological rigor, and practical considerations. The integration of machine learning and AI techniques has enabled more efficient, adaptable, and transparent systems, while the emphasis on standardization, interpretability, and data-driven approaches has laid the groundwork for future advancements. As the field continues to evolve, the focus will likely remain on developing robust, scalable, and user-friendly solutions that can effectively support the transformation of traditional business models into more agile and responsive frameworks.

## Future Directions

The future of additive manufacturing (AM) in business models is poised to be shaped by the convergence of advanced technologies, evolving consumer demands, and the need for sustainable and flexible production systems. As the field progresses, several key directions emerge from the analysis of related research, which highlight the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and decentralized data processing to enhance decision-making, optimize operations, and enable new business paradigms. One of the most promising areas is the application of federated learning (FL), which allows for collaborative intelligence without compromising data privacy or security, making it particularly relevant for industries where sensitive information is a concern [16]. This approach could facilitate the development of shared AM platforms where multiple stakeholders contribute data while maintaining control over their own information, thereby fostering innovation and reducing entry barriers for smaller enterprises. Another critical direction involves the use of real-time machine learning frameworks for process optimization and inverse modeling, as demonstrated in the context of composite manufacturing [17]. These techniques enable dynamic adjustments to production parameters, improving efficiency and product quality while reducing waste. The ability to perform high-speed simulations and multi-objective optimization in real time suggests a shift toward more responsive and adaptive manufacturing systems, which can be particularly beneficial in industries with complex and variable production requirements. Such advancements may also support the development of predictive maintenance strategies, where ML models analyze sensor data to anticipate equipment failures and schedule interventions proactively, thereby minimizing downtime and costs. The integration of human factors into AM systems is another area that demands further exploration. While much of the current research focuses on technical and economic aspects, the role of human operators, decision-makers, and end-users cannot be overlooked. Studies on AI, human factors, and automation emphasize the importance of designing systems that are not only efficient but also intuitive and user-friendly [14]. This includes considerations of ergonomics, cognitive load, and organizational workflows, which are essential for ensuring that AM technologies are adopted and utilized effectively. Future research should address how human-AI collaboration can be optimized to enhance productivity, creativity, and adaptability in manufacturing environments. Moreover, the increasing reliance on data-driven decision-making in AM business models necessitates robust and interpretable models that can handle uncertainty and variability. Techniques such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, as explored in financial and industrial applications, offer valuable insights into how complex systems can be modeled and predicted [15]. These methods could be extended to AM contexts to forecast demand, manage supply chains, and optimize resource allocation. The development of hybrid models that combine the strengths of different approaches may provide more accurate and reliable predictions, supporting strategic business decisions in an increasingly volatile market. Interdisciplinary collaboration remains a cornerstone for advancing AM in business models. The success of AM technologies depends not only on engineering and technological innovations but also on insights from economics, psychology, and social sciences. For instance, the lessons learned from pandemic modeling highlight the importance of integrating diverse data sources and methodologies to address complex, multi-faceted challenges [18]. Similarly, the application of AM in business models may benefit from cross-disciplinary research that considers not only technical feasibility but also ethical, environmental, and societal implications. This holistic approach will be crucial in ensuring that AM technologies are developed and deployed in a manner that is sustainable, equitable, and aligned with broader societal goals. In summary, the future of additive manufacturing in business models will likely be characterized by the integration of AI and ML for real-time optimization, the adoption of decentralized learning frameworks to address data privacy concerns, and the inclusion of human factors in system design. As these technologies continue to evolve, their successful implementation will depend on interdisciplinary collaboration, robust data management practices, and a commitment to addressing the broader implications of technological change. The ongoing research in these areas will play a vital role in shaping the next generation of AM-driven business models that are agile, resilient, and responsive to the needs of a rapidly changing global economy.
