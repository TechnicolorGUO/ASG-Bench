## Introduction

Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) has emerged as a powerful methodological tool in international business research, offering a systematic approach to understanding complex causal relationships across multiple cases. Unlike traditional quantitative methods that rely on statistical significance and linear causality, QCA emphasizes configurational thinking, enabling researchers to explore how different combinations of conditions lead to specific outcomes. This method is particularly well-suited for international business studies, where phenomena are often influenced by multiple interdependent factors, and where the goal is to identify patterns that are both necessary and sufficient for certain outcomes. Over the past decade, the application of QCA in this field has grown significantly, driven by its ability to handle small to medium-sized datasets, accommodate both qualitative and quantitative data, and provide insights into the diversity of pathways leading to similar outcomes. The increasing complexity of global business environments, characterized by rapid technological change, cross-cultural interactions, and evolving institutional frameworks, has further underscored the need for robust analytical tools like QCA. As researchers seek to move beyond simplistic cause-and-effect models, QCA offers a nuanced perspective that aligns with the multifaceted nature of international business phenomena. The method has been applied to a wide range of topics, including strategic decision-making, organizational performance, innovation diffusion, and policy impact, demonstrating its versatility and relevance across different research contexts. While QCA has gained traction, it also faces challenges related to methodological rigor, interpretative consistency, and the integration of diverse data sources. Nevertheless, the growing body of literature on QCA in international business research highlights its potential to contribute to both theoretical development and practical insights. As the field continues to evolve, further refinements in QCA techniques, along with increased interdisciplinary collaboration, will be essential to address the complexities of global business dynamics. By bridging the gap between case-based and generalizable knowledge, QCA has the potential to transform how researchers approach and interpret international business phenomena, offering a more holistic and context-sensitive understanding of the factors that shape organizational success and failure in a globalized world.

## Background

Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) has emerged as a powerful methodological tool in international business research, offering a systematic approach to understanding complex causal relationships among multiple conditions. Unlike traditional quantitative methods that emphasize statistical significance and linear causality, QCA is rooted in a configurational logic that allows researchers to explore how different combinations of factors lead to specific outcomes. This method is particularly well-suited for studying phenomena in international business where multiple variables interact in non-linear and context-dependent ways. The increasing complexity of global markets, the diversity of institutional environments, and the multifaceted nature of strategic decisions have made QCA an attractive option for scholars seeking to uncover nuanced insights into organizational and market dynamics. Over the years, QCA has evolved from a niche technique to a widely recognized approach, with applications spanning firm performance, innovation strategies, and cross-cultural management practices. The method's ability to handle small to moderate sample sizes, its flexibility in dealing with both qualitative and quantitative data, and its focus on causal complexity have contributed to its growing popularity. As international business research continues to grapple with the challenges of globalization, digital transformation, and sustainability, the relevance of QCA is likely to expand further. The integration of QCA with other analytical techniques, such as machine learning and network analysis, has also opened new avenues for exploring dynamic and interdependent phenomena. While QCA has been extensively applied in various fields, its adoption in international business research has been gradual, with scholars increasingly recognizing its potential to complement existing methodologies. The growing body of literature on QCA reflects a shift toward more holistic and context-sensitive analyses, aligning with the broader trends in social science research that emphasize complexity, diversity, and interconnectedness. As such, the continued development and refinement of QCA methods will be crucial in addressing the evolving research questions in international business.

## Current State of the Art

The current state of the art in Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) within international business research reflects a growing recognition of its value in addressing complex, multi-causal phenomena that are often difficult to capture through traditional quantitative methods. While QCA has long been established in the social sciences, its application in international business research has gained momentum, particularly in areas such as strategic management, organizational behavior, and cross-cultural studies. Recent studies have demonstrated how QCA provides a systematic and rigorous approach to identifying configurations of conditions that lead to specific outcomes, making it particularly suited for analyzing the interplay of multiple factors in international business settings [1]. One of the key developments in the field is the integration of qualitative insights into the design and evaluation of QCA studies. This has been influenced by broader trends in social science research, where there is an increasing emphasis on methodological rigor and interdisciplinary collaboration [1]. Researchers have begun to adopt frameworks that align QCA with qualitative research standards, ensuring that the interpretive aspects of the analysis are as robust as the empirical ones. This approach has been particularly valuable in contexts where the relationships between variables are not linear or easily quantifiable, which is often the case in international business research. Another significant trend is the use of advanced computational techniques to enhance the capabilities of QCA. While QCA traditionally relies on Boolean algebra and set-theoretic logic, recent work has explored the integration of machine learning and data-driven methods to improve the identification of necessary and sufficient conditions. This has led to the development of hybrid models that combine the strengths of qualitative and quantitative approaches, allowing for more nuanced and flexible analyses of complex business environments [2]. These methods have been particularly useful in scenarios where large-scale data is available, and where traditional QCA may struggle with the complexity and volume of information. In addition, there has been a growing emphasis on evaluation and benchmarking in QCA research. As with other areas of data science, the need for standardized metrics and rigorous validation has become increasingly important. Researchers have proposed various ways to assess the quality of QCA results, including the use of statistical measures, sensitivity analyses, and cross-validation techniques. This focus on evaluation is part of a broader movement toward methodological transparency and reproducibility, which is essential for building trust in QCA as a research tool in international business studies [3]. A notable challenge in the current state of QCA research is the need to balance methodological rigor with practical applicability. While QCA offers a powerful framework for understanding complex causal relationships, its implementation can be resource-intensive and requires careful consideration of data quality, case selection, and theoretical framing. Moreover, the interpretation of QCA results often depends on the researcher's theoretical background and contextual understanding, which can introduce subjectivity into the analysis. Addressing these challenges requires ongoing methodological development, as well as a commitment to interdisciplinary collaboration and open science practices. Overall, the current state of QCA in international business research is marked by a dynamic and evolving landscape. The integration of qualitative insights, computational methods, and rigorous evaluation practices has expanded the potential of QCA to address some of the most pressing questions in the field. As the field continues to develop, it is likely that QCA will play an increasingly important role in advancing our understanding of complex international business phenomena.

## Future Directions

The future of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in international business research is poised for significant evolution, driven by the increasing complexity of global business environments and the need for more nuanced, context-sensitive analytical tools. As the field continues to expand, several key directions emerge that can guide both methodological development and practical application. One of the most pressing areas for future research is the integration of QCA with emerging data-driven methodologies, particularly those involving artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Recent studies have underscored the importance of transparent and interpretable models, especially in domains where decisions have substantial real-world consequences [4]. This aligns with the growing interest in explainable AI (XAI), where the ability to trace and understand causal pathways is essential. QCA, with its focus on configurational causality, offers a complementary approach that can enhance the interpretability of complex models by identifying multiple, non-linear pathways to outcomes. Moreover, the increasing availability of large-scale, heterogeneous datasets presents both opportunities and challenges for QCA. While traditional QCA relies on relatively small datasets with carefully curated variables, the integration of big data sources requires new methodological approaches. This includes the development of robust techniques for data preprocessing, variable selection, and handling missing or noisy data, which are critical for maintaining the validity of QCA results. Recent work on unsupervised learning for economic risk evaluation during the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of adapting analytical methods to rapidly changing and data-scarce environments [9]. Such insights could inform the adaptation of QCA to dynamic, real-time international business contexts. Another important direction is the expansion of QCA into interdisciplinary and policy-oriented research. The European Strategy on AI emphasizes the need for a coordinated, society-centered approach to AI development, with a strong focus on transparency, ethics, and public engagement [6]. This aligns with the potential of QCA to bridge the gap between theoretical constructs and practical policy implications, particularly in areas such as cross-border collaboration, regulatory compliance, and sustainable business practices. By incorporating insights from public health, social sciences, and policy studies, QCA can contribute to a more holistic understanding of international business phenomena. Furthermore, the growing awareness of bias and fairness in AI and ML systems calls for a critical re-evaluation of how QCA is applied and interpreted. The analysis of machine learning conference reviews has revealed institutional and gender biases that can influence research dissemination and impact [5]. Similarly, QCA studies must be vigilant in addressing potential biases in data selection, variable definition, and causal inference. Future research should explore ways to enhance the methodological rigor of QCA by incorporating diverse perspectives and ensuring that findings are representative of a wide range of international contexts. The evolution of QCA also necessitates a greater emphasis on methodological innovation. While the current body of work has primarily focused on crisp-set and fuzzy-set QCA, there is a growing need to explore hybrid and multi-method approaches that can better capture the complexity of international business phenomena. Recent advancements in conditional canonical correlation estimation and generative learning of heterogeneous tail dependence offer promising avenues for enhancing the analytical capabilities of QCA [7], [8]. These techniques could enable more sophisticated modeling of interactions and dependencies, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. In summary, the future of QCA in international business research lies in its ability to adapt to new data landscapes, integrate with emerging analytical tools, and address the ethical and methodological challenges of contemporary research. By embracing interdisciplinary collaboration, enhancing transparency, and refining methodological approaches, QCA can continue to provide valuable insights into the complex and dynamic nature of global business processes.
