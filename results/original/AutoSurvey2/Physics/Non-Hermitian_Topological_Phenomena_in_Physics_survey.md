## Introduction

The study of non-Hermitian topological phenomena in physics has emerged as a vibrant and rapidly evolving field, bridging the gap between traditional topological systems and the complex, often dissipative, behaviors observed in open quantum and classical systems. Unlike Hermitian systems, which conserve probability and exhibit real energy spectra, non-Hermitian systems allow for the possibility of complex eigenvalues, leading to novel physical effects such as exceptional points, non-orthogonal eigenstates, and unconventional topological invariants. These phenomena have been observed across a wide range of physical platforms, including photonic crystals, cold atom systems, and electrical circuits, and have sparked significant interest due to their potential for applications in robust sensing, unidirectional waveguiding, and topologically protected transport. The interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology has revealed a rich landscape of new physical behaviors, challenging the conventional understanding of topological phases and their classification. Recent advances have shown that non-Hermitian systems can host topological invariants that are fundamentally different from their Hermitian counterparts, such as the non-Bloch bulk-boundary correspondence and the role of parity-time (PT) symmetry in stabilizing topological states. This has led to a reevaluation of the foundational principles of topological quantum matter and has opened up new avenues for exploring the interplay between geometry, symmetry, and dissipation in many-body systems. Theoretical progress has been complemented by experimental realizations, demonstrating the feasibility of engineering non-Hermitian topological systems with tailored properties. Moreover, the integration of machine learning and advanced computational techniques has further enhanced our ability to analyze and predict the behavior of these systems, enabling the discovery of new topological phases and the optimization of their performance in practical applications. As the field continues to evolve, it is clear that non-Hermitian topological phenomena represent a paradigm shift in our understanding of quantum and classical systems, with far-reaching implications for both fundamental physics and technological innovation. The ongoing exploration of these phenomena not only deepens our knowledge of topological order but also paves the way for the development of next-generation devices that leverage the unique properties of non-Hermitian systems.

## Background

The study of non-Hermitian topological phenomena has emerged as a vibrant and interdisciplinary research area, bridging concepts from quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, and modern computational methods. Unlike traditional Hermitian systems, which conserve probability and exhibit real eigenvalues, non-Hermitian systems allow for complex eigenvalues and non-unitary evolution, giving rise to novel physical behaviors such as exceptional points, non-orthogonal eigenstates, and unconventional topological invariants. These phenomena have been observed in a wide range of physical systems, including photonic crystals, electronic circuits, and open quantum systems, and have sparked significant interest due to their potential for applications in robust sensing, lasing, and quantum information processing. The theoretical framework for non-Hermitian topology has been enriched by the development of generalized notions of topological protection, where the interplay between non-Hermiticity and symmetry leads to new classifications of topological phases. Recent advances have also highlighted the importance of geometric and topological structures in understanding the behavior of non-Hermitian systems, such as the role of complex band structures, non-Bloch momentum spaces, and exceptional surface states. In parallel, computational methods have played a crucial role in exploring these phenomena, with techniques such as singular value decomposition, normalizing flows, and equivariant neural networks offering new ways to model and analyze non-Hermitian systems. The integration of topological data analysis, Riemannian geometry, and symmetry-preserving algorithms has further expanded the toolkit available to researchers in this field. As non-Hermitian topological systems continue to challenge conventional wisdom, their study not only deepens our understanding of fundamental physics but also opens new avenues for technological innovation. The interplay between theoretical insights, computational advances, and experimental realizations underscores the dynamic and evolving nature of this research area, making it a fertile ground for future exploration.

## Current State of the Art

The study of non-Hermitian topological phenomena in physics has seen significant advancements in recent years, with a growing emphasis on integrating geometric, topological, and physical principles into theoretical and computational frameworks. A key theme across various works is the use of geometric structures to model complex systems, particularly in the context of dynamic and static physical systems. For instance, the *Pioneer* framework introduces a physics-informed Riemannian graph ordinary differential equation (ODE) that respects the intrinsic geometry of dynamic systems and the second law of thermodynamics, ensuring entropy-increasing behavior [6]. This approach demonstrates how geometric constraints can be leveraged to model physical dynamics while maintaining consistency with fundamental laws. Another important direction is the exploration of topological features in machine learning and data analysis. The *Quotient Homology Theory of Representation in Neural Networks* provides a novel perspective on neural network representations by analyzing them through the lens of homology, enabling the intrinsic computation of topological invariants such as Betti numbers without relying on external metrics [2]. This work highlights the increasing role of topological data analysis (TDA) in understanding the structure of neural representations and their relationship to the underlying data. In parallel, the development of optimization methods that can handle non-convex and non-smooth problems has become a central challenge in both theoretical and applied settings. The *Ball-Proximal (="Broximal") Point Method* addresses this by introducing a new algorithm that extends the applicability of proximal point methods to broader classes of non-convex problems, including those with ball-convexity [3]. This method represents a step forward in the design of robust optimization techniques that can be applied to complex physical and machine learning systems. The integration of invariance and symmetry principles into models has also gained traction, particularly in the context of crystal structure prediction and material generation. The *ContinuouSP* model, for example, enforces invariance and continuity in the generation of crystal structures, leveraging energy-based learning to respect the symmetry and periodicity of materials [4]. This approach underscores the importance of physical constraints in generative modeling and highlights the potential of physics-informed machine learning in materials science. In the domain of deep learning, the use of orthonormal basis functions as activations, such as Hermite polynomials, Fourier trigonometric functions, and tropical polynomials, has shown promise in improving training stability and performance [1]. These activations provide an alternative to traditional non-linearities and offer a more structured way of approximating complex functions, which can be particularly beneficial in high-dimensional or physically constrained settings. Furthermore, the application of topological contrastive learning, as demonstrated by *TopoCL*, has opened new avenues for analyzing time series data by leveraging topological features to enhance representation learning [5]. This work illustrates how topological methods can be used to extract meaningful patterns from sequential data, with potential applications in both physics and machine learning. Overall, the current state of the art in non-Hermitian topological phenomena reflects a multidisciplinary effort that combines insights from physics, mathematics, and machine learning. The emphasis on geometric and topological structures, the integration of physical principles, and the development of robust optimization techniques are all critical components of this evolving field. These advancements not only deepen our understanding of complex systems but also pave the way for more accurate and interpretable models in both theoretical and applied contexts.

## Future Directions

The exploration of non-Hermitian topological phenomena in physics has revealed rich and intricate structures that extend beyond the conventional framework of Hermitian systems. As the field progresses, several promising directions emerge, informed by the interplay between physics, machine learning, and optimization. One of the most compelling avenues lies in the development of symmetry-based frameworks that unify diverse aspects of learning and physical dynamics. Inspired by the concept of parameter symmetry in deep learning, which suggests that symmetry breaking and restoration could underpin the learning process, similar principles may offer new insights into the classification and control of non-Hermitian topological phases. This approach could lead to a more systematic understanding of how symmetries, or their absence, influence the emergence of topological features in open and dissipative systems [11]. Another critical direction involves the integration of physics-informed machine learning techniques to model and predict non-Hermitian topological behavior. Recent advances in physics-conditioned diffusion models and physics-trained neural networks demonstrate the potential of embedding physical laws directly into the learning process. These methods not only enhance the interpretability of the models but also improve their generalization and extrapolation capabilities, especially in scenarios where experimental data is scarce or expensive to obtain. By leveraging such techniques, researchers can design more robust and efficient tools for studying non-Hermitian systems, particularly in contexts involving inverse problems or complex field configurations [13] [10]. The synergy between continuous dynamical systems and neural network architectures also presents new opportunities for modeling non-Hermitian topological phenomena. The interpretation of transformers as discretized ordinary differential equations (ODEs) suggests that similar dynamical perspectives could be applied to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, leading to novel ways of analyzing their time evolution and stability. Such an approach could provide a deeper understanding of how non-Hermitian systems evolve under external perturbations or when coupled to environments, potentially opening new pathways for quantum simulation and control [9]. Efficient and reliable optimization methods are essential for training and analyzing non-Hermitian models, especially in high-dimensional and non-convex settings. The development of regularized Newton methods with strong theoretical guarantees offers a promising direction for improving the convergence and stability of such models. These techniques could be particularly valuable in the context of non-Hermitian systems, where traditional optimization strategies may struggle due to the presence of complex eigenvalues and non-unitary dynamics [8]. Furthermore, the application of advanced sampling techniques, such as those used in physics-conditioned diffusion models, could enable more accurate exploration of the parameter space, facilitating the discovery of novel topological phases. The role of symmetry in non-Hermitian systems remains an open and challenging problem. While Hermitian systems are often classified based on their symmetry properties, the presence of gain and loss in non-Hermitian systems complicates this classification. Future work should focus on developing a comprehensive framework that accounts for both symmetry and non-Hermitian effects, potentially leading to new topological invariants and classification schemes. This could involve extending concepts from gauge theory and differential geometry to non-Hermitian settings, as suggested by recent studies on lattice gauge theories and continuous dynamical systems [13] [9]. Moreover, the integration of machine learning with traditional computational methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and inverse problems could significantly advance the study of non-Hermitian topological systems. Techniques such as Gaussian process regression and variational decision diagrams offer new ways to model and infer physical quantities from limited or noisy data. These methods could be particularly useful in scenarios involving non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, where the interplay between topology and dissipation leads to complex and non-trivial behavior [7] [12]. Finally, the broader implications of non-Hermitian topological phenomena extend beyond fundamental physics. The principles underlying these systems could inspire new designs in quantum technologies, such as robust quantum gates and topologically protected information transfer. Additionally, the insights gained from studying non-Hermitian systems may inform the development of more resilient and adaptive machine learning models, particularly those operating in dynamic or uncertain environments. As the field continues to evolve, the cross-pollination of ideas between physics, mathematics, and machine learning will be crucial in unlocking the full potential of non-Hermitian topological phenomena.
