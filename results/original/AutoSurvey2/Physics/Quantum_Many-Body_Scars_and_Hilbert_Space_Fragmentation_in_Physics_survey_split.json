      "content": "**Abstract** Quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation represent a paradigm shift in the understanding of thermalization and dynamics in isolated quantum systems. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the theoretical and experimental progress in this rapidly evolving field. Starting with the foundational concepts, we explore how quantum many-body scars—non-ergodic states that resist thermalization—challenge the conventional assumptions of equilibration in complex quantum systems. The paper delves into the underlying mechanisms, including the role of integrability, symmetry, and effective models that give rise to these persistent, scarred states. We review the current state of the art, emphasizing the interplay between quantum coherence, localization, and nonequilibrium dynamics. Recent advances highlight the relevance of these phenomena to quantum information processing, many-body localization, and the design of novel quantum materials. The integration of machine learning and advanced computational techniques has further expanded the scope of investigation, enabling the discovery and characterization of scarred states in larger and more complex systems. The paper also outlines future directions, focusing on the development of data-driven methods, improved numerical simulations, and the exploration of novel platforms for experimental realization. By synthesizing key findings and identifying open questions, this work aims to provide a roadmap for researchers seeking to deepen our understanding of non-ergodic quantum dynamics and their broader implications in condensed matter physics and quantum information science."

      "content": "The study of quantum many-body systems has long been a central challenge in theoretical and experimental physics, driven by the complexity of interactions among a large number of particles. In recent years, the concept of quantum many-body scars has emerged as a fascinating phenomenon that challenges the conventional understanding of thermalization in isolated quantum systems. These scars, which are non-ergodic states that persist over long timescales, suggest the existence of special structures within the Hilbert space that defy the typical behavior of generic quantum systems. This has led to a growing interest in the broader topic of Hilbert space fragmentation, where the Hilbert space is partitioned into dynamically disconnected subspaces, giving rise to non-thermal dynamics and long-lived coherence. The interplay between these phenomena and the underlying geometry of quantum states has become a key area of research, with implications for quantum information, condensed matter physics, and even quantum computing. The exploration of quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation has benefited from a confluence of ideas from diverse fields, including statistical physics, machine learning, and quantum computing. Recent advances in computational methods, particularly those leveraging neural networks and physics-informed modeling, have provided new tools to analyze the spectral and dynamical properties of complex quantum systems. For instance, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been successfully applied to compute the spectrum of quantum systems, offering a mesh-free and unsupervised approach to solving the Schrödinger equation [2]. These methods, which incorporate physical constraints directly into the learning process, have shown promise in handling systems with complex eigenfunctions and degeneracies, suggesting a broader applicability to the study of non-thermal states. At the same time, the analysis of loss landscapes in deep learning has drawn intriguing parallels with the statistical physics of spin glasses, revealing structural similarities between the optimization dynamics of neural networks and the thermodynamics of disordered systems [3]. This connection has inspired new theoretical frameworks for understanding the behavior of machine learning models, and it raises the question of whether similar principles might govern the dynamics of quantum systems. The study of loss landscapes, whether in classical or quantum contexts, has become a critical tool for uncovering the underlying geometry of complex systems and identifying the conditions under which non-ergodic behavior can emerge. In the realm of quantum machine learning, novel embedding techniques have been introduced to better capture the structure of quantum data. For example, reverse map projections have been proposed as equivariant quantum embeddings that preserve norm information, thereby addressing limitations of traditional amplitude embedding methods [1]. These approaches highlight the importance of symmetry and invariance in quantum data representation, which is also a central theme in the study of Hilbert space fragmentation. By leveraging symmetries, such embeddings can enhance the performance of quantum machine learning models, suggesting a deeper connection between the geometric structure of quantum states and their computational utility. Moreover, the integration of quantum computing with classical machine learning techniques has opened new avenues for exploring the dynamics of quantum systems. Quantum-enhanced methods, such as discrete randomized smoothing, have demonstrated the potential for improving the robustness of machine learning models through quantum algorithms like Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) [5]. These hybrid approaches not only offer computational advantages but also provide a framework for studying the interplay between quantum and classical dynamics, which is relevant to understanding the emergence of non-thermal states in many-body systems. In parallel, theoretical perspectives from thermodynamics and geometry have been applied to understand the behavior of large-scale systems, including language models and other complex machine learning architectures. By formulating these systems in terms of entropy, partition functions, and free energy, researchers have gained new insights into their scaling properties and generalization capabilities [4]. Such approaches, while primarily focused on classical systems, suggest that similar principles may underlie the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, particularly those exhibiting non-ergodic behavior. The growing body of work on quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation reflects a broader trend in the intersection of physics and machine learning. The use of mathematical and physical abstractions—such as symmetry, entropy, and loss landscapes—has proven instrumental in uncovering the hidden structures of complex systems. As the field continues to evolve, the development of more efficient and scalable computational methods, combined with a deeper theoretical understanding of quantum dynamics, will be essential for advancing our knowledge of these intriguing phenomena."

      "content": "The study of quantum many-body systems has long been a central topic in theoretical and experimental physics, driven by the challenge of understanding the complex dynamics of interacting particles in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Over the past decade, the discovery of quantum many-body scars—non-ergodic states that persist in systems otherwise expected to thermalize—has opened new avenues for exploring the interplay between quantum coherence, localization, and thermalization. These scars, which manifest as long-lived, low-entanglement states, challenge the conventional wisdom that generic many-body systems evolve towards thermal equilibrium, and have sparked renewed interest in the role of integrability, symmetry, and conserved quantities in quantum dynamics. Concurrently, the phenomenon of Hilbert space fragmentation, where the total Hilbert space splits into dynamically disconnected subspaces, has been identified as a key mechanism underlying the emergence of such non-thermal states. This fragmentation can arise from the presence of conserved quantities or symmetries that restrict the system's evolution to specific subspaces, thereby giving rise to long-lived memory effects and suppressed thermalization. The study of these phenomena has profound implications for quantum information science, particularly in the context of quantum computing and the design of error-correcting codes, where the control of entanglement and coherence is essential. Recent advances in both theoretical and computational methods have enabled more precise characterization of these effects, with a growing emphasis on the role of quantum algorithms, machine learning techniques, and probabilistic models in analyzing and predicting the behavior of complex quantum systems. Notably, the integration of physics-informed models with data-driven approaches has proven particularly effective in capturing the intricate structures of many-body quantum states, as demonstrated by recent works that combine diffusion models, optimal dimension reduction, and quantum matrix multiplication algorithms. These developments underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in advancing our understanding of quantum many-body systems and their rich dynamical behavior. As the field continues to evolve, the exploration of quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation remains a vibrant area of research, with potential applications ranging from quantum simulation to the development of novel quantum technologies."

      "content": "The current state of the art in the study of quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation reflects a growing intersection between quantum physics, condensed matter theory, and machine learning. These phenomena, which challenge the conventional understanding of thermalization in isolated quantum systems, have garnered significant attention due to their implications for quantum information, nonequilibrium dynamics, and the development of novel quantum technologies. Recent advances have been driven by both theoretical insights and the application of advanced computational methods, including tensor decompositions, physics-informed neural networks, and symmetry-preserving architectures, which have enabled deeper exploration of the complex structures underlying these systems. One of the central challenges in studying quantum many-body scars is the identification and characterization of non-thermal, long-lived states that persist in systems otherwise expected to thermalize. These states, often associated with specific symmetries or conserved quantities, are believed to arise from the fragmentation of the Hilbert space into dynamically disconnected subspaces. This fragmentation, which can be understood as a form of effective integrability, has been observed in various models, such as the spin-1/2 Ising model with a transverse field and the Fermi-Hubbard model. The presence of such scars has profound implications for quantum computing, as they may offer new ways to protect quantum information from decoherence. Recent studies have leveraged machine learning techniques to uncover the structure of these scarred states and to predict their behavior in complex systems. For instance, physics-informed deep learning approaches have been used to model the dynamics of quantum systems, incorporating physical constraints directly into the learning process to ensure consistency with known laws of quantum mechanics. These methods have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing the evolution of quantum states, even in regimes where traditional numerical simulations struggle. Similarly, tensor decomposition techniques, such as the CP-HiFi method, have been employed to efficiently represent and analyze high-dimensional quantum data, enabling the extraction of meaningful patterns and structures that would otherwise be intractable. The integration of machine learning with physical models has also led to the development of symmetry-preserving architectures, which are crucial for maintaining the integrity of quantum systems during training and inference. By explicitly encoding symmetries into the design of neural networks or tensor networks, researchers have been able to improve the efficiency and accuracy of their models, particularly in systems with complex interactions. This approach has been particularly effective in the study of quantum many-body systems, where the preservation of symmetries can significantly reduce the computational burden and enhance the interpretability of results. Another important trend is the exploration of quantum-secure machine learning techniques, which aim to protect the integrity and privacy of quantum data during training and inference. These methods, which often rely on quantum cryptographic protocols, have been shown to provide strong guarantees against information leakage, making them particularly relevant for applications involving sensitive quantum data. While these approaches are still in their early stages, they represent a promising direction for the future of quantum machine learning. In addition to these technical developments, there has been a growing emphasis on the scalability and generalizability of machine learning models in the context of quantum many-body systems. Many recent works have focused on designing architectures that can handle large-scale systems with high-dimensional data, often leveraging techniques such as kernel methods, tensor parameterizations, and efficient gradient estimation. These efforts have not only improved the performance of existing models but have also opened up new possibilities for studying quantum systems that were previously considered too complex to analyze. Overall, the current state of the art in quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation is characterized by a dynamic interplay between theoretical physics and computational methods. The application of machine learning techniques has provided new tools for understanding the intricate dynamics of quantum systems, while the development of symmetry-preserving and scalable models has enabled more accurate and efficient simulations. As research in this area continues to evolve, it is likely that further integration of physics-based insights with advanced computational techniques will lead to new discoveries and a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles governing quantum many-body systems."

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The future directions for research on quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation are poised to benefit significantly from the convergence of quantum physics with advanced computational and machine learning techniques. As the field continues to evolve, several promising avenues emerge, driven by the need for more accurate models, efficient algorithms, and deeper physical insights. One of the most compelling areas is the development of data-driven methods that can learn and predict the complex dynamics of many-body systems. Recent work has demonstrated that neural differential equations can effectively infer Hamiltonians from trajectory data, offering a reliable and interpretable approach to Hamiltonian learning [10]. This suggests that future research may focus on extending such methods to more complex and higher-dimensional systems, potentially including those with non-trivial scar structures and fragmented Hilbert spaces. Another critical direction lies in the efficient characterization and tomography of quantum states, particularly in the context of Hilbert space fragmentation. Stabilizer bootstrapping offers a powerful framework for agnostic quantum state tomography, enabling the efficient estimation of stabilizer fidelity and other important quantum measures [7]. This technique could be instrumental in characterizing the structure of fragmented Hilbert spaces, especially in systems where traditional methods struggle due to the exponential growth of the state space. Future work may explore how these methods can be adapted to handle more general quantum states and mixed systems, thereby broadening their applicability to a wider range of physical models. The integration of physics-based constraints into machine learning models is another key trend that is likely to shape the future of the field. Physics-informed deep learning has already shown promise in solving complex continuum mechanics problems, such as strain gradient plasticity, by incorporating balance laws and constitutive equations directly into the learning process [6]. This approach could be extended to quantum many-body systems, where the underlying physical laws govern the evolution of the system. By embedding these constraints into neural network architectures, researchers may be able to improve the accuracy and generalizability of models that aim to capture the dynamics of scarred and fragmented states. In addition, the availability of high-quality datasets is becoming increasingly important for training and validating models in this domain. The Hessian QM9 database, which includes molecular Hessians in various solvent environments, illustrates the value of incorporating curvature information into machine learning models [9]. Future efforts may focus on creating similar databases for quantum many-body systems, particularly those exhibiting scars or Hilbert space fragmentation. These datasets could be used to train more accurate interatomic potentials or to develop new methods for predicting the stability and dynamics of complex quantum states. Furthermore, the application of geometric and functional analysis to quantum many-body problems presents an exciting opportunity for theoretical advancement. The study of Wasserstein gradient flows of MMD functionals has provided new insights into the structure of probability measures and their evolution under certain dynamics [8]. These mathematical tools could be leveraged to better understand the geometry of Hilbert space fragmentation, offering a more rigorous framework for analyzing the long-term behavior of quantum systems. Future research may explore how these techniques can be adapted to quantum settings, potentially leading to new methods for studying non-equilibrium dynamics and thermalization in fragmented systems. Beyond theoretical and computational advances, the practical implications of quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation are also of growing interest. For instance, the ability to control and manipulate these structures could have significant consequences for quantum information processing and error correction. Recent work on measurement-free local error correction and reinforcement learning has demonstrated the potential for improving quantum memory lifetimes [11]. This suggests that future research may investigate how scarred states or fragmented Hilbert spaces can be harnessed to enhance the robustness of quantum systems against decoherence and other forms of noise. In summary, the future of research on quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation will likely involve a multidisciplinary approach that combines advances in quantum theory, machine learning, and computational methods. By leveraging data-driven techniques, integrating physical constraints into learning models, and developing new mathematical tools, researchers can deepen their understanding of these complex phenomena and unlock new possibilities for both fundamental science and technological applications."
