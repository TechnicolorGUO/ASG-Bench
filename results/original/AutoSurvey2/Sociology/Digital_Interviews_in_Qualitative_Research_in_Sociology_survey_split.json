      "content": "Digital interviews have become a cornerstone of qualitative research in sociology, offering researchers a means to explore complex social phenomena through in-depth, narrative-based data collection. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, so too do the methods and technologies used to conduct and analyze these interviews. The integration of digital tools, including artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), has introduced new possibilities for enhancing the depth, reach, and analytical power of qualitative inquiry. This shift is not without challenges, as it raises important questions about the validity, reliability, and ethical implications of using digital platforms for capturing and interpreting human experiences. The growing body of research in this area reflects a diverse range of approaches, from the simulation of social dynamics in multi-agent systems [2] to the automated analysis of unstructured discourse [1]. These studies collectively highlight the increasing reliance on computational methods to support and extend traditional qualitative techniques. At the same time, they underscore the need for a critical examination of how these technologies shape the research process, particularly in terms of their ability to capture nuanced social interactions and cultural contexts. The interplay between human-like social behavior in AI systems and the sociological theories that underpin qualitative research is a recurring theme across this literature. Several studies have drawn on sociological and educational frameworks to inform their models and analyses, emphasizing the importance of contextual and cultural sensitivity in AI-driven research [1]. This focus on context is further reinforced by the recognition that digital interviews, while offering new opportunities for data collection, also require careful consideration of the social and psychological factors that influence participant responses. Moreover, the use of automated and semi-automated analysis tools has become increasingly prevalent, enabling researchers to handle large-scale datasets and extract meaningful patterns from unstructured data [1]. However, this trend also raises concerns about the limitations of algorithmic interpretation and the potential for bias in automated systems. As such, the field is witnessing a growing emphasis on the development of robust evaluation standards to ensure the trustworthiness and transparency of digital interview methodologies. The implications of these developments extend beyond methodological considerations, touching on broader questions about the role of technology in shaping our understanding of society. By examining the intersections between digital interviews, AI, and sociological inquiry, this survey paper seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field, highlighting key themes, challenges, and future directions for research."

      "content": "The integration of digital tools into qualitative research methodologies has significantly transformed the landscape of sociological inquiry, particularly in the context of interviews. Traditional face-to-face interviews, while rich in depth and nuance, have long been constrained by logistical challenges, geographic limitations, and the need for extensive human resources. The advent of digital interviews, facilitated by advancements in communication technologies and artificial intelligence, has expanded the possibilities for data collection, analysis, and interpretation. These digital methods not only enhance accessibility but also introduce new dimensions of interaction, enabling researchers to capture dynamic and multifaceted social phenomena in ways that were previously unattainable. As digital interviews become more prevalent, it is essential to critically examine their theoretical underpinnings, methodological implications, and the broader sociological context in which they are embedded. A growing body of research has explored the intersection of artificial intelligence and qualitative research, highlighting both the opportunities and challenges associated with digital interview methodologies. For instance, studies have demonstrated how AI-driven frameworks can support the structuring and analysis of interview data, offering tools for categorization, sentiment analysis, and even predictive modeling of participant responses [7]. These developments align with broader trends in computational social science, where machine learning and natural language processing are increasingly used to decode complex social interactions. Furthermore, the use of AI in research environments, such as the gamified academic writing platform GAMER PAT, underscores the potential for AI to not only assist in data collection but also to shape the research process itself through structured and interactive engagement [6]. This suggests that digital interviews are not merely a technical extension of traditional methods but are increasingly becoming part of a larger, more integrated research ecosystem. One of the key themes emerging from this body of work is the need for user-centric evaluation of AI systems within sociological research. Papers such as \"Measure what Matters\" emphasize the importance of psychometric approaches in assessing the reliability and validity of AI-generated data, particularly when it comes to understanding human behavior and social dynamics [9]. This reflects a broader concern within the field about ensuring that digital interview tools are not only technically sound but also ethically and socially responsible. Similarly, research on feature importance in online content moderation highlights the necessity of identifying and prioritizing relevant variables that influence user behavior, reinforcing the idea that digital interviews must be designed with a clear understanding of the social contexts in which they are deployed [3]. These insights point to the importance of developing robust evaluation frameworks that go beyond mere technical performance to consider the broader sociological implications of AI-assisted research. Methodological innovation has also been a central focus in the evolution of digital interviews. The introduction of novel frameworks such as double kernel representation learning and dual-modal counterfactual contrastive construction demonstrates a growing emphasis on interpretability and adaptability in AI-driven research tools [5] [4]. These methodologies not only improve the accuracy of data analysis but also enhance the transparency of AI systems, which is crucial for maintaining trust and accountability in qualitative research. Moreover, the use of semantic similarity and structured generation techniques in experimental settings further illustrates how digital interviews can be tailored to specific research questions, allowing for more nuanced and context-sensitive data collection [5]. This shift towards more sophisticated and flexible methodologies reflects a broader trend in the field toward integrating AI as a collaborative partner rather than a mere data processing tool. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in the adoption and implementation of digital interviews in sociological research. Issues related to bias, representation, and the ethical implications of AI-mediated data collection continue to be significant concerns. For example, studies on AI-mediated communication have shown how algorithmic biases can shape social interactions and influence the outcomes of digital interviews [8]. Additionally, the reliance on large-scale datasets and automated analysis raises questions about the validity and generalizability of findings, particularly when dealing with diverse and marginalized populations. These challenges underscore the need for ongoing critical reflection and methodological rigor in the design and execution of digital interviews. In conclusion, the increasing use of digital interviews in qualitative sociological research represents a significant shift in how we understand and engage with social phenomena. While these tools offer new opportunities for data collection and analysis, they also introduce complex methodological, ethical, and theoretical considerations. The integration of AI into the research process necessitates a re-evaluation of traditional paradigms and a commitment to developing frameworks that are both technically advanced and socially responsible. As the field continues to evolve, it will be essential to maintain a dialogue between technological innovation and sociological theory, ensuring that digital interviews remain a valuable and meaningful tool for understanding the complexities of human social life."

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The current state of the art in digital interviews within qualitative research in sociology reflects a dynamic interplay between traditional methodologies and emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly large language models (LLMs). Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of generative large language models (gLLMs) to enhance content analysis by improving speed, cost-efficiency, and the ability to decode implicit meanings, often requiring minimal annotated data [13]. These models are increasingly being integrated into qualitative research workflows, offering researchers tools that can automate coding tasks, identify patterns, and even generate insights that complement human interpretation. However, the use of such models necessitates careful prompt engineering, validation, and an awareness of potential biases, as their outputs may not always align with the nuanced understanding required in sociological analysis. A significant development in this area is the growing emphasis on evaluating AI systems through psychometric frameworks, such as situational judgment tests (SJTs), which allow for the assessment of AI's ability to make contextually appropriate decisions [9]. This approach not only provides a structured method for evaluating AI performance but also introduces domain-specific personas that enhance the realism of the evaluation process. Such methodologies are particularly relevant in digital interviews, where the ability of AI to understand and respond to complex social contexts is critical. The evaluation of social intelligence in AI has also gained traction, with benchmarks like SI-Bench being introduced to assess how well large language models can engage in human-like conversations [10]. These benchmarks are built on real human dialogues and aim to measure not only the quality of responses but also the models’ ability to reason through social interactions. However, while state-of-the-art models often outperform humans in process reasoning, they still lag in terms of the naturalness and depth of their responses, highlighting the ongoing challenges in replicating human social intelligence. Another important trend is the integration of symbolic reasoning with neural models to improve contextual understanding and reliability. For instance, the BaZi-based character simulation benchmark demonstrates how combining symbolic knowledge with LLMs can enhance persona reasoning, particularly in culturally grounded and temporally dynamic scenarios [12]. This hybrid approach is especially relevant for digital interviews, where understanding the cultural, emotional, and temporal dimensions of participants' narratives is essential. The importance of realistic and contextually rich data has also emerged as a key theme in the literature. Datasets such as LibriConvo, which simulate conversations based on literary texts, provide a controlled environment for evaluating speech processing technologies like automatic speech recognition (ASR) and diarization [11]. While these datasets are primarily aimed at technical applications, they underscore the broader need for high-quality, contextually accurate data in digital interviews, which can improve the reliability and validity of AI-assisted qualitative analysis. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in ensuring the interpretability, reliability, and ethical alignment of AI systems in sociological research. Many studies highlight the difficulty of understanding how models arrive at their conclusions, which is crucial for maintaining transparency and trust in qualitative findings. Moreover, the ethical implications of using AI in sensitive areas such as digital interviews require careful consideration, including issues of consent, bias, and the potential for misinterpretation of human narratives. In summary, the current state of the art in digital interviews within qualitative sociology is characterized by a growing reliance on AI, particularly LLMs, to enhance data analysis and interpretation. While these technologies offer significant benefits in terms of efficiency and scalability, they also present new challenges that require ongoing research, methodological innovation, and ethical scrutiny. The integration of hybrid approaches, the development of realistic datasets, and the refinement of evaluation frameworks are all critical to advancing the role of AI in qualitative research. As the field continues to evolve, it is essential for researchers to remain vigilant about the limitations and implications of these technologies, ensuring that they serve as tools that enhance, rather than replace, human insight and judgment."

      "heading": "Future Directions",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The future of digital interviews in qualitative research in sociology is increasingly shaped by the integration of artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning (RL), and multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. As the field moves beyond mere automation of data collection, it is becoming evident that the next wave of development will focus on enhancing the interpretive depth, adaptability, and contextual awareness of AI-driven interview tools. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of AI to support researchers in generating more nuanced, structured, and contextually aware conversations, while also addressing concerns around reliability, bias, and human oversight [15]. This evolution necessitates a balanced approach that leverages AI's capabilities without compromising the integrity of qualitative inquiry. One of the most significant directions for future research lies in the development of adaptive and context-aware conversational systems. Frameworks such as AURA demonstrate how reinforcement learning can be used to dynamically adjust interview strategies based on user responses, leading to more engaging and informative interactions [19]. Such systems have the potential to move beyond static questionnaires and toward more fluid, interactive interviews that can respond to the participant's evolving narrative. However, achieving this requires not only technical advancements in natural language understanding and generation but also a deeper integration of sociological theory into AI design, ensuring that the generated dialogues remain relevant and meaningful within the research context. Another critical area of development is the improvement of structural and contextual understanding in AI models. Studies like \"Questionnaire meets LLM\" emphasize that while LLMs are powerful in generating text, their ability to interpret structured data—such as survey responses or questionnaire formats—remains limited [16]. Future work must focus on refining these structural skills through better prompt engineering, format-aware training, and the development of specialized benchmarks that reflect the complexities of qualitative data. Similarly, the CRAG-MM benchmark highlights the challenges of multi-modal and multi-turn RAG systems, particularly in real-world scenarios involving wearable data and dynamic interactions [16]. These findings suggest that the next generation of AI tools for digital interviews must be more robust, context-sensitive, and capable of handling heterogeneous data sources. Human-in-the-loop approaches are also expected to play a central role in the future of digital interviews. While some studies advocate for greater AI autonomy, especially in high-volume or low-stakes settings, others argue for a more cautious, supervised approach that ensures interpretive accuracy and ethical responsibility [15]. This tension underscores the need for flexible frameworks that can accommodate varying levels of human involvement, depending on the research goals and context. Moreover, the growing emphasis on transparency and auditability in AI systems calls for the development of evaluation metrics that go beyond accuracy, incorporating measures of interpretive depth, fairness, and ethical alignment. In addition, the increasing use of AI in qualitative research raises important methodological and philosophical questions. For instance, the concept of \"AI personhood\" challenges traditional notions of agency and authorship in research, prompting a reevaluation of how AI-generated content is interpreted and validated [17]. Similarly, the use of AI in generating role-playing scenarios, such as therapist-client dialogues or simulated social interactions, opens new possibilities for experimental and observational studies [14]. These developments highlight the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between sociologists, computer scientists, and ethicists to ensure that AI tools are not only technically advanced but also socially and culturally appropriate. Finally, the future of digital interviews in sociology will likely be shaped by the continued refinement of evaluation methodologies and benchmarking standards. As demonstrated by works like QASU and CRAG-MM, the creation of task-specific benchmarks is essential for assessing the performance of AI systems in qualitative settings [16]. These benchmarks not only help identify strengths and weaknesses but also guide the development of more effective models. Furthermore, the integration of quantitative intertextuality methods from digital humanities offers new opportunities for analyzing the relationships between interview narratives and broader social contexts [18]. By combining these approaches, researchers can develop a more comprehensive understanding of how digital interviews contribute to sociological inquiry. In conclusion, the future of digital interviews in qualitative sociology is poised at the intersection of technological innovation and methodological rigor. As AI systems become more capable of generating, analyzing, and interpreting human narratives, they will need to be designed with a deep understanding of the sociological research process. This includes addressing issues of interpretive bias, structural comprehension, and human-AI collaboration, while also developing robust evaluation frameworks that reflect the complexity of qualitative research. The ongoing dialogue between technical advancements and sociological theory will be crucial in ensuring that digital interviews remain a valuable and ethical tool for understanding human behavior and"
