## Introduction

Freebirthing, the practice of giving birth without the presence of trained medical professionals, has emerged as a significant historical and social phenomenon that intersects with broader sociological themes such as autonomy, healthcare access, and cultural norms. While often viewed through the lens of health policy and medical ethics, freebirthing also reflects deeper societal shifts in how individuals and communities perceive control over their bodies, trust in institutional systems, and the role of technology in personal life decisions. This survey paper explores freebirthing as a multifaceted social phenomenon, situating it within the broader context of sociological inquiry. By examining historical trends, cultural variations, and the socio-political dynamics that shape freebirthing practices, this paper aims to contribute to the growing discourse on how individual choices intersect with collective norms and institutional structures. The discussion draws on insights from various sociological and technological studies, highlighting the ways in which freebirthing is not merely a medical or personal choice but a complex social act that reflects broader societal values and challenges. Recent scholarship has increasingly recognized the importance of understanding such practices through a sociocultural lens, emphasizing the need for nuanced analyses that account for the interplay between individual agency and structural constraints [1]. Moreover, the rise of digital platforms and artificial intelligence has introduced new dimensions to the discourse on freebirthing, as individuals increasingly turn to online communities and algorithmic tools to inform their decisions. This shift underscores the evolving nature of social phenomena in the digital age, where traditional boundaries between public and private, medical and personal, are continually redefined. The sociological study of freebirthing thus offers a unique opportunity to examine how technological advancements and cultural transformations shape human behavior and social organization. As such, this paper not only provides an overview of the current state of research on freebirthing but also identifies key areas for future investigation, particularly in relation to the ethical, cultural, and epistemological implications of such practices. By situating freebirthing within a broader sociological framework, this survey contributes to a deeper understanding of how individuals navigate complex social systems and make decisions that reflect both personal and collective values. The analysis also highlights the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing the multifaceted nature of freebirthing, drawing on insights from sociology, health studies, and digital humanities to provide a comprehensive and contextually rich perspective. Ultimately, this paper seeks to illuminate the social significance of freebirthing and to encourage further scholarly engagement with this underexplored yet increasingly relevant topic.

## Background

Freebirthing, the practice of giving birth without the assistance of medical professionals, has emerged as a significant and multifaceted phenomenon within the realm of sociology, reflecting broader shifts in societal attitudes toward healthcare, autonomy, and the body. Historically, freebirthing has roots in various cultural and religious traditions, where childbirth was often seen as a natural process that required minimal external intervention. However, the modern resurgence of freebirthing in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has been shaped by a complex interplay of factors, including distrust in medical institutions, a desire for bodily autonomy, and the influence of alternative health movements. This phenomenon has attracted scholarly attention not only for its medical implications but also for its sociocultural significance, as it intersects with issues of gender, power, and knowledge production. The study of freebirthing as a historical and social phenomenon is thus deeply embedded in the broader discourse on how individuals and communities negotiate health, identity, and agency in the face of institutional structures. Recent research has highlighted how freebirthing is not merely a medical choice but also a political and ideological act, often rooted in critiques of the medicalization of childbirth and the commodification of healthcare. These perspectives align with broader sociological inquiries into how individuals navigate and resist dominant systems of knowledge and power, particularly in contexts where trust in institutional authority is eroded. The increasing availability of digital platforms has further amplified the visibility and reach of freebirthing communities, enabling the formation of networks that share experiences, information, and ideologies. This digital dimension of freebirthing reflects larger trends in how information is disseminated, evaluated, and acted upon in contemporary society, where the boundaries between personal experience, expert knowledge, and digital discourse are increasingly blurred. The role of social media in shaping beliefs and practices around childbirth underscores the importance of understanding how information is processed, interpreted, and internalized by individuals, a theme that resonates with studies on belief formation, fake news, and the dynamics of knowledge sharing. Moreover, the rise of freebirthing as a movement has been accompanied by debates over its safety, ethics, and implications for public health, revealing tensions between individual choice and collective responsibility. These debates are not unique to freebirthing but are emblematic of broader societal conflicts over the role of expertise, the legitimacy of alternative knowledge systems, and the responsibilities of individuals in a highly interconnected world. The sociological analysis of freebirthing thus provides a lens through which to examine the shifting relationships between individuals, institutions, and knowledge, as well as the ways in which digital technologies and social networks shape contemporary practices and beliefs. As such, freebirthing serves as a compelling case study for understanding how historical and social factors converge to produce new forms of resistance, identity, and agency in the modern era.

## Current State of the Art

The current state of the art in the study of freebirthing as a historical and social phenomenon in sociology reflects a growing interdisciplinary engagement with the intersection of technology, ethics, and human agency. While the direct literature on freebirthing is not explicitly covered in the selected reference papers, the broader themes of human representation, ethical implications, and the role of technology in shaping social practices provide a valuable framework for understanding the sociological dimensions of this phenomenon. Contemporary research in artificial intelligence, computational social science, and digital ethics highlights the increasing importance of aligning technological systems with human values, behaviors, and cultural contexts. These concerns are particularly relevant when examining practices such as freebirthing, which involve deep personal and societal decisions that are often mediated by evolving technological and institutional landscapes. A central theme across the reviewed literature is the ethical and legal challenges associated with AI and its integration into human-centric domains. For instance, the development of digital afterlives through AI raises critical questions about the representation of individuals posthumously, the preservation of intent, and the responsibilities of designers and users [2]. These issues resonate with the broader sociological discourse on how technology influences personal agency and social norms, particularly in contexts where individuals make autonomous decisions about their bodies and lives. Similarly, the discussion on copyright, generative AI, and academic publishing underscores the tension between innovation and the protection of individual and collective knowledge [7]. Such tensions are equally pertinent in the context of freebirthing, where the balance between personal choice and institutional oversight is a recurring concern. Another significant trend in the literature is the emphasis on human alignment and representativeness in AI systems. Studies have shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on small human samples can enhance their alignment with human behavior, although limitations remain in capturing the full complexity of human reasoning and action [5]. This finding is particularly relevant for sociological research, which often seeks to model and understand diverse human experiences. The use of empirical data, such as survey-derived personas, to improve the representativeness of AI outputs [6], further illustrates the importance of grounding technological systems in real-world social contexts. These methodologies offer insights into how freebirthing practices can be analyzed through the lens of sociotechnical systems, where human choices are shaped by and shape technological and institutional environments. The interdisciplinary nature of the reviewed papers also highlights the need for a holistic approach to understanding complex social phenomena. Theoretical work on rationality, knowledge, and multi-agent systems [3] provides a conceptual foundation for examining how individuals and groups make decisions in uncertain and dynamic environments. This is particularly relevant for freebirthing, which involves a range of social, cultural, and medical considerations. Moreover, the call for stronger ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks in AI research [7] underscores the importance of addressing power dynamics and ensuring that technological advancements do not exacerbate existing inequalities or undermine individual autonomy. In addition to ethical and methodological considerations, the reviewed literature also points to the growing recognition of the limitations of purely technical solutions. The discussion on the Turing Test and its legacy [4] illustrates the ongoing debate about what it means for a system to be intelligent or human-like, a question that has direct implications for how we understand and evaluate human practices such as freebirthing. Similarly, the critique of sycophantic AI behavior [10] highlights the need for AI systems to engage with human values in a meaningful and transparent way, rather than merely mimicking human responses. These insights suggest that any sociological analysis of freebirthing must account for the ways in which technology mediates, influences, and sometimes distorts human decision-making. Overall, the current state of the art in related fields provides a rich foundation for further exploration of freebirthing as a historical and social phenomenon. The integration of ethical, methodological, and interdisciplinary approaches offers a pathway for understanding the complex interplay between individual agency, technological innovation, and societal structures. As the field continues to evolve, it is essential to maintain a critical and reflective stance, ensuring that technological advancements serve the broader interests of society while respecting the diversity and complexity of human experiences.

## Future Directions

The future of research on freebirthing as a historical and social phenomenon in sociology is poised to benefit from interdisciplinary approaches that integrate insights from computational modeling, policy analysis, and social theory. As the concept of freebirthing continues to gain attention, particularly in the context of shifting societal norms around childbirth, medical authority, and individual autonomy, scholars are increasingly called upon to examine its evolution, cultural significance, and implications for public health and social policy. Emerging research in related fields offers valuable frameworks and methodologies that can inform this growing area of study. One key direction for future research lies in the development of more nuanced models that capture the long-term social and demographic impacts of freebirthing practices. This includes examining how such practices intersect with broader demographic trends, as seen in studies that use hybrid computational models to forecast the effects of fertility policies on population structures [12]. By applying similar methodologies, sociologists could better understand how freebirthing trends might influence birth rates, healthcare systems, and gender roles over time. Moreover, the integration of machine learning and data-driven approaches, as demonstrated in studies on historical text dating [8], could provide new tools for analyzing longitudinal data on freebirthing practices across different cultural and historical contexts. Another promising avenue is the exploration of the ethical and relational dimensions of freebirthing, particularly in relation to the role of technology and artificial intelligence in shaping human experiences. As research in relational AI continues to evolve, particularly with the development of systems that support long-term identity and emotional regulation [11], there is potential to investigate how digital technologies might influence or mediate freebirthing practices. This could include examining the use of AI in providing support to freebirthing individuals, as well as the ethical implications of such interventions in terms of autonomy, safety, and informed decision-making. In addition, the increasing focus on fairness and equity in algorithmic decision-making [9] suggests that future studies on freebirthing should also consider the social and political dimensions of access to care, including how socioeconomic status, race, and geographic location affect the ability of individuals to choose freebirthing as an option. This aligns with broader sociological concerns about health disparities and the role of policy in shaping reproductive choices. By drawing on frameworks that emphasize fairness and social justice, researchers can contribute to a more equitable understanding of freebirthing as a practice that is not uniformly accessible or practiced across different populations. Furthermore, the growing interest in modeling complex social interactions—whether in traffic scenarios [13] or in human behavior during crises [12]—suggests that future research on freebirthing could benefit from more sophisticated simulation techniques. These models could help researchers explore how freebirthing practices might interact with broader social dynamics, such as community support networks, legal regulations, and public health responses. Such approaches would allow for a more dynamic and interactive analysis of how freebirthing is experienced and represented in different social contexts. Ultimately, the future of research on freebirthing as a historical and social phenomenon will likely be shaped by the continued integration of diverse methodologies and perspectives. By drawing on insights from computational modeling, policy analysis, and social theory, scholars can develop a more comprehensive understanding of this complex and evolving practice. As the field progresses, it will be essential to maintain a critical and interdisciplinary approach that remains sensitive to the ethical, cultural, and political dimensions of freebirthing, ensuring that future research not only advances academic knowledge but also contributes to more informed and equitable public discourse.

## Conclusion

Freebirthing, as explored in this survey paper, emerges as a complex historical and social phenomenon that intersects with key sociological themes such as autonomy, healthcare access, and cultural norms. The paper has traced the evolution of freebirthing from its historical roots in various cultural and religious traditions to its contemporary resurgence, highlighting how it reflects broader societal shifts in attitudes toward medical authority, bodily autonomy, and trust in institutional systems. The study underscores the significance of freebirthing not only as a healthcare practice but also as a social act that embodies individual and collective values, resistance to medicalization, and the reclamation of childbirth as a natural and empowering experience. The current state of the field reveals an increasing interdisciplinary engagement with freebirthing, drawing from sociology, medical ethics, and policy analysis. While direct academic literature on freebirthing remains limited, the broader discourse on human agency, ethical implications, and the role of technology in shaping social practices offers a robust framework for understanding its sociological dimensions. Researchers are beginning to recognize the need for more systematic studies that examine the cultural, economic, and political contexts in which freebirthing occurs, as well as its implications for public health and policy. Looking ahead, future research should prioritize interdisciplinary approaches that integrate computational modeling, ethnographic studies, and policy analysis to better understand the dynamics of freebirthing. Key challenges include addressing the lack of comprehensive data, navigating the ethical and legal complexities of the practice, and ensuring that diverse perspectives—particularly those of women and marginalized communities—are represented in the discourse. Additionally, the impact of digital technologies and social media on the spread and perception of freebirthing presents a promising area for investigation. In conclusion, freebirthing represents more than a medical choice; it is a reflection of deeper societal values and tensions. As the practice continues to evolve, it offers a critical lens through which to examine shifting notions of autonomy, trust, and the role of institutions in shaping personal and collective experiences. Further scholarly attention is essential to fully grasp its historical significance and contemporary relevance within the broader landscape of social and health-related phenomena.
