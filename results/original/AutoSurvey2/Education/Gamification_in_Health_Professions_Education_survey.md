## Introduction

Gamification has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance learning and engagement across various domains, including health professions education. By integrating game elements such as points, badges, leaderboards, and challenges into educational contexts, gamification aims to motivate learners, foster active participation, and improve knowledge retention. In recent years, the intersection of gamification and artificial intelligence has opened new avenues for research, particularly in the development of adaptive and interactive learning systems. This survey paper explores the application of gamification in health professions education, examining its theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and the role of advanced computational techniques in enhancing its effectiveness. The integration of gamification into education is not a novel concept, but its application in health professions education has gained significant attention due to the high stakes and complex nature of medical training. Traditional educational methods often struggle to maintain learner engagement, especially in scenarios that require repetitive practice, critical thinking, or the development of procedural skills. Gamification addresses these challenges by transforming learning experiences into interactive and rewarding activities. Several studies have demonstrated that gamified learning environments can lead to improved motivation, better knowledge retention, and enhanced skill acquisition, particularly in areas such as clinical decision-making, surgical training, and patient communication. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in the areas of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and probabilistic modeling, have further expanded the potential of gamification in educational settings. For instance, DRL has been successfully applied to train AI agents to perform complex tasks in dynamic environments, such as competitive games and real-world simulations. These techniques can be adapted to create intelligent tutoring systems that provide personalized feedback and adaptive challenges, thereby enhancing the learning experience. Similarly, GANs have been used to generate diverse and realistic scenarios, allowing learners to practice in varied and unpredictable conditions. Probabilistic models, on the other hand, offer a means to analyze and predict user behavior, enabling the design of more effective gamification strategies that align with individual learning needs. A key aspect of gamification in health professions education is the ability to model and understand user behavior. Studies have shown that gamification elements such as badges and leaderboards significantly influence user engagement and persistence. By leveraging probabilistic approaches, researchers have been able to capture the temporal dynamics of user interactions, allowing for more accurate predictions of engagement patterns. This, in turn, enables the development of adaptive systems that can adjust gamification elements in real-time based on user performance and preferences. Furthermore, the analysis of skill decomposition in multiplayer environments has provided insights into the key components that contribute to successful performance, which can be translated into targeted training modules for medical professionals. While the application of gamification in health professions education is still in its early stages, the growing body of research suggests that it holds great promise for transforming traditional educational paradigms. The integration of AI-driven techniques, such as DRL and GANs, offers the potential to create more immersive and responsive learning environments. However, challenges remain, including the need for robust evaluation frameworks, ethical considerations in the use of user data, and the development of standardized metrics for assessing the effectiveness of gamified learning interventions. As the field continues to evolve, interdisciplinary collaboration between educators, game designers, and AI researchers will be essential in shaping the future of gamification in health professions education.

## Background

Gamification, the application of game design elements in non-game contexts, has gained significant attention in health professions education as a means to enhance engagement, motivation, and learning outcomes. Over the past decade, researchers have explored various ways to integrate gamification techniques into medical and allied health training, with a focus on improving knowledge retention, clinical skills, and professional development. This approach leverages the inherent appeal of games—such as competition, feedback, rewards, and progression—to transform traditional educational practices into more interactive and immersive experiences. As the field evolves, it has become increasingly clear that gamification is not merely a superficial addition to learning environments but a powerful tool that can influence behavior, foster intrinsic motivation, and support long-term knowledge acquisition. The integration of gamification in health professions education has been informed by a range of interdisciplinary research, including studies in artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and behavioral science. Notably, advances in machine learning and data-driven methodologies have enabled the development of adaptive and personalized gamified systems that respond to individual learner needs and performance metrics. For instance, techniques such as reinforcement learning have been employed to design intelligent tutoring systems that provide real-time feedback and adjust difficulty levels based on user performance [3]. Similarly, the use of collaborative frameworks, such as those seen in generative unadversarial networks (GUNs), has inspired new models for cooperative learning environments where learners and instructors work together to achieve shared educational goals [2]. These developments highlight the potential of gamification to not only make learning more engaging but also to create more effective and efficient educational experiences. Furthermore, the rise of human-centric applications, such as systems that monitor human activity through head pose and facial expression analysis, has provided valuable insights into how gamified systems can be designed to respond to non-verbal cues and emotional states, thereby enhancing the personalization and adaptability of learning platforms [4]. The intersection of gamification with reinforcement learning and option discovery has also led to the development of systems that can identify and prioritize key learning objectives, enabling more structured and goal-oriented educational experiences [1]. As the field continues to expand, it is essential to critically evaluate the theoretical underpinnings, practical implementations, and empirical evidence supporting the use of gamification in health professions education. This survey paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research, identify emerging trends, and highlight areas for future investigation, with a particular emphasis on the role of data-driven and human-centered methodologies in shaping the next generation of gamified learning systems.

## Current State of the Art

The current state of the art in gamification within health professions education reflects a dynamic and rapidly evolving field that integrates artificial intelligence, machine learning, and behavioral science to enhance learning outcomes and engagement. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of gamified systems to improve both cognitive and physical learning processes, particularly through adaptive and personalized approaches. A key development is the use of AI-driven systems that dynamically adjust to the learner's performance and health state, as seen in the Adaptive Motion Gaming AI for Health Promotion [7]. This system employs Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and motion analysis to ensure balanced use of body segments, promoting healthier engagement during physical activities. Similarly, the CogniLearn system has been significantly enhanced through improved motion recognition accuracy, achieving a notable increase from 76.46\ In the realm of reinforcement learning (RL), recent advancements have introduced novel methods that enhance the effectiveness of mHealth interventions. The Cohesion-based Online Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning framework [6] represents a significant contribution by leveraging network cohesion to improve policy learning, thereby enhancing the stability and generalization of the learning process. This approach is particularly relevant in health professions education, where personalized and adaptive feedback is crucial. Complementing this, the Effective Warm Start for Online Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning method [9] demonstrates how prior knowledge and decision rules can be used to initialize RL models, accelerating learning and improving user engagement. Such techniques are essential for creating responsive and effective gamified systems that can adapt to the unique needs of individual learners. Another notable trend is the integration of computer vision and deep learning techniques for motion and behavior analysis. The Forecasting Human Dynamics from Static Images study [8] presents a groundbreaking approach by predicting 3D human poses from a single image, which has implications for real-time feedback in gamified learning environments. This work, while primarily focused on computer vision, illustrates the broader potential of deep learning in capturing and interpreting human movement, which can be applied to enhance the interactivity and responsiveness of gamified educational tools. The common themes across these studies include the integration of AI and machine learning, the emphasis on personalization and adaptation, and the use of motion and behavior data to inform and enhance learning experiences. These studies also reflect a strong focus on real-world applications, addressing challenges such as cognitive development, health promotion, and user engagement in mHealth contexts. Despite the progress, challenges remain, including the need for more extensive validation across diverse populations and the requirement for accurate and reliable data input to support real-time health state monitoring. Overall, the current state of the art in gamification for health professions education is marked by a convergence of technological innovation and pedagogical insight, with a clear trajectory toward more intelligent, adaptive, and effective learning systems. These developments not only enhance the educational experience but also contribute to broader health outcomes by fostering engagement, improving knowledge retention, and promoting healthier behaviors. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of these advanced techniques will play a critical role in shaping the future of health professions education.

## Future Directions

The future of gamification in health professions education is poised to benefit significantly from advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in the areas of reinforcement learning, multimodal interaction, and adaptive systems. Drawing from recent research, several key directions emerge that could shape the next phase of development in this field. One prominent area of growth is the integration of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to create more intelligent and adaptive gamified learning environments. For instance, the application of deep Q-networks (DQNs) in general video game AI demonstrates the potential for developing systems that can learn and adapt to a wide range of tasks, which could be leveraged to design gamified educational platforms that respond dynamically to user performance and learning needs [12]. Similarly, the use of eligibility traces and recurrent networks in DQNs highlights the importance of temporal learning and memory in creating more effective and engaging educational experiences [10]. These techniques could be employed to develop games that not only assess knowledge but also provide personalized feedback and progression paths based on real-time performance data. Another critical direction involves the use of warm start strategies in online reinforcement learning to accelerate the learning process in mHealth and educational applications. By incorporating prior knowledge and decision rules, these methods can significantly enhance the initial performance of gamified systems, leading to improved user engagement and faster adaptation to new learning scenarios [9]. This approach could be particularly beneficial in health professions education, where learners often require immediate and relevant feedback to reinforce clinical skills and decision-making abilities. The development of user-driven intelligent interfaces that combine multimodal augmented reality (AR) and brain-computer interaction (BCI) offers another promising avenue for future research. These interfaces have the potential to create highly personalized and immersive learning experiences, especially for individuals with functional disabilities, by adapting to their unique interaction preferences and cognitive needs [10]. In the context of health professions education, such technologies could be used to simulate complex clinical scenarios, allowing learners to practice and refine their skills in a safe and controlled environment. Additionally, the exploration of evolutionary algorithms, such as rolling horizon evolution (RHE), presents an alternative approach to traditional reinforcement learning methods. These techniques, which have shown promise in general video game playing, could be adapted to create gamified systems that evolve and improve over time based on user interaction and performance data [13]. This could lead to the development of more robust and flexible educational tools that continuously adapt to the changing needs of learners and educators. The increasing focus on multimodal interaction and real-time feedback in AI systems also points to the importance of integrating diverse sensory inputs into gamified learning environments. For example, the use of conditional stochastic networks for motion prediction and time-contrastive networks for video analysis could enhance the realism and interactivity of virtual simulations, making them more effective for training in health professions [15] [11]. These advancements could help bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, enabling learners to develop critical skills in a more engaging and interactive manner. Furthermore, the application of fuzzy logic and knowledge-guided neural networks in health and medical corpora suggests new opportunities for improving the interpretability and reliability of gamified systems [14] [16]. By incorporating domain-specific knowledge into AI models, these approaches could help ensure that gamified learning environments are not only engaging but also accurate and aligned with established medical practices. In summary, the future of gamification in health professions education is likely to be shaped by a convergence of AI-driven personalization, multimodal interaction, and adaptive learning systems. As these technologies continue to evolve, they hold the potential to transform traditional educational models into more dynamic, engaging, and effective learning experiences. By leveraging insights from diverse fields such as video game AI, mHealth, and assistive technologies, researchers and educators can work together to create innovative solutions that meet the complex and evolving needs of health professionals.
