## Background

The global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in early 2020 led to unprecedented disruptions in education systems worldwide, with developing countries facing particularly acute challenges. As schools and universities closed their doors to curb the spread of the virus, the reliance on digital technologies for remote learning became more critical than ever. However, the transition to online education was not uniform, and the impact of the pandemic on education in developing countries was compounded by pre-existing infrastructural, economic, and technological disparities. These challenges highlighted the urgent need to understand the multifaceted consequences of the pandemic on educational access, quality, and equity in resource-constrained settings. The role of technology in mitigating these disruptions has been a focal point of research, with a particular emphasis on how machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) can support educational delivery in contexts where traditional methods are insufficient. Transfer learning, for instance, has shown promise in enabling the development of accurate and efficient models for tasks such as image-based disease detection in agriculture [4], suggesting its potential for adapting to educational challenges through data-efficient learning. Similarly, the concept of "machine teaching" [5] offers a framework for designing more accessible and user-friendly AI systems, which could be instrumental in empowering educators and students in developing regions. In the context of language acquisition, computational models that integrate tutor feedback have demonstrated the value of combining interactive and data-driven approaches [1], a principle that could be extended to support personalized learning in remote environments. The broader application of AI in education also depends on the availability of high-quality data, as seen in studies that leverage text analysis for understanding political preferences [3] or sensor data for human activity recognition [2]. These methodologies underscore the importance of data-driven decision-making and the need for robust data collection and analysis frameworks. Despite these advancements, significant limitations remain, particularly in terms of data quality, model generalizability, and the feasibility of deploying AI solutions in low-resource settings. The challenges faced in applying transfer learning to agricultural disease detection [4] and multimodal activity recognition [2] highlight the need for context-specific adaptations and careful method selection. As the global education system continues to evolve in response to the pandemic, the integration of AI and machine learning technologies must be guided by an understanding of the unique constraints and opportunities present in developing countries. This survey aims to explore these dynamics, drawing on insights from various domains to provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of COVID-19 on education in such contexts.

## Current State of the Art

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education in developing countries has been profound, with disruptions to traditional learning models, increased digital divides, and challenges in maintaining educational quality and accessibility. As the global education system grapples with these issues, a growing body of research has emerged, leveraging computational methods to analyze, understand, and mitigate the effects of the pandemic on education. This body of work highlights the potential of data-driven approaches, interdisciplinary methodologies, and technological innovations to address the unique challenges faced in these contexts. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of computational methods in education, particularly in the analysis of pedagogical content and the development of adaptive learning systems. For instance, the concept of "pedagogical roles" has been introduced as a way to categorize and understand the function of educational documents, enabling more effective content retrieval and adaptation [10]. This approach has implications for developing localized and context-aware educational materials, which is crucial in regions with limited resources and diverse learning needs. Similarly, the integration of Answer Set Programming (ASP) into educational applications has demonstrated the potential of knowledge representation techniques to enhance reasoning and decision-making in educational contexts [6]. These developments underscore the growing role of computational tools in shaping the future of education in developing countries. Data-driven decision making has also become a central theme in the analysis of educational challenges. Several studies have explored how psychometric and academic data can be used to predict student employability, revealing that secondary attributes such as personality traits and learning styles significantly influence outcomes [11]. This highlights the need for more holistic approaches to educational assessment and intervention, which can be particularly beneficial in developing countries where standardized testing may not fully capture the complexities of student performance. Moreover, the application of network science to international relations and ideological proximity has shown how computational models can be adapted to analyze educational policies and their global implications [9]. These insights suggest that the same methodologies used in social sciences can be applied to understand and improve educational systems in resource-constrained settings. Interdisciplinary approaches have proven essential in addressing the multifaceted challenges of the pandemic. The convergence of education, computer science, and social science has led to the development of innovative solutions, such as machine teaching, which aims to make machine learning more accessible to non-experts [8]. This paradigm shift has important implications for education in developing countries, where access to technical expertise is often limited. By simplifying the process of teaching machines, such approaches can empower educators and learners to develop and utilize AI tools that support personalized learning and remote instruction. Additionally, the use of deep learning and reinforcement learning in educational contexts has shown promise in improving adaptive learning systems, which can be critical for students in areas with inconsistent internet access or limited educational infrastructure [7]. The emphasis on accessibility and usability in educational technologies has also been a recurring theme. Many studies have focused on making learning tools more user-friendly and adaptable to different contexts, recognizing that technological solutions must be tailored to the specific needs of developing regions. This includes the development of frameworks that facilitate the integration of advanced computational techniques into practical educational applications, ensuring that these innovations are not only effective but also sustainable in the long term [6]. Such efforts are crucial in bridging the digital divide and ensuring that all learners, regardless of their geographic or economic background, can benefit from technological advancements. Overall, the current state of research on the impact of COVID-19 on education in developing countries reflects a dynamic and evolving landscape. The integration of computational methods, data-driven strategies, and interdisciplinary approaches has opened new avenues for addressing educational challenges. As the field continues to develop, the focus will likely shift toward scalable, context-sensitive, and equitable solutions that can support long-term educational resilience in these regions. The insights gained from this body of work will be instrumental in shaping future educational policies and technological innovations that prioritize accessibility, adaptability, and inclusivity.

## Future Directions

The future of research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education in developing countries must build on the methodologies and insights from diverse fields, including machine learning, natural language processing, and data-driven decision-making. A key area for exploration is the application of transfer learning techniques, as demonstrated in the literature on tropical cyclone prediction [14], where models trained on one dataset can be effectively adapted to another. This approach could be particularly valuable in education, where data availability is often limited and models need to generalize across different regions and contexts. Similarly, the use of knowledge distillation and model compression, as seen in works on shallow network training [16], offers a pathway to deploy efficient educational tools in low-resource settings, where computational infrastructure may be constrained. Another promising direction is the integration of predictive modeling into educational systems to identify at-risk students and intervene early. The work on predicting STEM attrition using transcript data [17] highlights the potential of machine learning in understanding student performance and retention. Such models could be adapted to monitor the effects of disrupted learning during the pandemic, enabling targeted support for students who are most vulnerable. Additionally, the use of NLP techniques to analyze policy discourse, as seen in the study of United Nations General Debates [13], suggests that similar methods could be applied to analyze educational policies, public sentiment, and the effectiveness of interventions in developing countries. The development of adaptive and scalable learning systems is also critical. The concept of the Continuous Hint Factory [15], which provides hints in sparse problem spaces, offers a framework for improving tutoring systems and personalized learning platforms. This is especially relevant in the context of remote and hybrid learning, where students may have limited access to direct instruction. By leveraging such techniques, educational technologies can become more responsive and effective, even in environments with sparse data. Moreover, the increasing use of deep learning and reinforcement learning in various domains, as illustrated by works on autonomous robots [16] and multitask learning [12], suggests that similar approaches could be applied to optimize resource allocation, curriculum design, and teacher training in developing countries. The ability to learn from limited data and adapt to changing conditions is essential for building resilient educational systems in the wake of the pandemic. In conclusion, the future of research on the impact of COVID-19 on education in developing countries should emphasize the development of scalable, adaptive, and data-efficient models. By drawing on advances in machine learning, NLP, and knowledge distillation, researchers can create tools that not only address immediate challenges but also contribute to long-term improvements in educational access and quality. These efforts will require interdisciplinary collaboration, a focus on context-specific solutions, and a commitment to leveraging existing data in meaningful ways.
