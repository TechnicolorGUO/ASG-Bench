## Introduction

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly in the domain of natural language processing, has ushered in a new era of educational technologies. Among the most transformative innovations are large language models (LLMs), which have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding, generating, and reasoning about human language. These models, trained on vast amounts of text data, have found applications across various domains, including education, where they are being leveraged to enhance learning experiences, support instructional design, and improve educational outcomes. As the field continues to evolve, a comprehensive survey of the role of LLMs in education becomes essential to understand the current state of research, identify key challenges, and highlight future directions. The integration of LLMs into educational contexts has been driven by the increasing availability of digital learning resources and the need for personalized, scalable solutions. Research in this area has explored a wide range of applications, from automated essay scoring and intelligent tutoring systems to adaptive learning platforms and curriculum development. Notably, the use of machine learning techniques, such as transfer learning and latent variable modeling, has enabled the development of more accurate and robust educational models. For instance, the Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT) approach has demonstrated the effectiveness of pre-trained models in text classification tasks, offering a promising direction for NLP-based educational applications [4]. Similarly, additive latent effect models like ALE have shown that incorporating hidden factors—such as student effort and instructor quality—can significantly improve the accuracy of grade prediction models [2]. A critical challenge in leveraging LLMs for education is ensuring that the models are trained on diverse and representative data. The study on emerging language spaces learned from massively multilingual corpora highlights the potential of multilingual models to capture semantic relationships across languages, suggesting that such approaches could be extended to multilingual educational settings [7]. However, the ethical and practical implications of using large-scale data, especially in the context of privacy-restricted environments like MOOCs, necessitate the development of reproducible and transparent research frameworks. The MORF framework, for example, addresses these concerns by providing a scalable, open-source platform for predictive modeling and replication [1]. Such infrastructure is crucial for ensuring that findings in educational AI are not only innovative but also replicable and generalizable. Beyond technical capabilities, the theoretical foundations of machine teaching and learning have also contributed to the growing interest in LLMs for education. The conceptual framework proposed in the overview of machine teaching provides a structured approach to understanding and organizing teaching problems, which can inform the design of more effective AI-driven educational systems [3]. Additionally, the use of neural networks and deep learning techniques has led to new insights into how language models can be trained and adapted to specific educational tasks. For instance, the nested LSTM architecture has been explored for its ability to capture complex sequential dependencies in educational data [6], while studies on the evaluation of neural network explanations have raised important questions about model interpretability and trustworthiness in educational settings [5]. The interdisciplinary nature of this field is evident in the convergence of NLP, machine learning, and educational theory. Researchers are not only developing more sophisticated models but also rethinking traditional educational paradigms in light of AI capabilities. This includes exploring how LLMs can support collaborative learning, foster critical thinking, and adapt to individual student needs. At the same time, concerns about bias, fairness, and the ethical use of AI in education remain significant, necessitating ongoing dialogue among educators, technologists, and policymakers. In summary, the application of large language models in education represents a dynamic and rapidly evolving area of research. While significant progress has been made in developing models that can understand and generate language with high accuracy, the true potential of these systems lies in their ability to transform educational practices in meaningful and equitable ways. As the field continues to advance, it is imperative to build on existing research, address open challenges, and ensure that the benefits of LLMs are accessible to all learners.

## Background

The integration of large language models (LLMs) into the field of education has been driven by a growing recognition of the potential of these models to enhance instructional design, support personalized learning, and improve educational analytics. Over the past decade, research has increasingly focused on how language models can be adapted to address the unique challenges of educational contexts, from understanding student behavior to generating instructional content. Early work in this area emphasized the importance of domain-specific modeling, as seen in the development of ontology-based frameworks for educational technologies, which aimed to align instructional design with domain-specific knowledge structures [8]. These models highlighted the need for flexible, context-aware systems that can support diverse educational objectives, laying the foundation for later advancements in language modeling for education. A critical development in this domain has been the emergence of contextualized word representations, which have significantly advanced the ability of models to capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of language. By leveraging deep bidirectional language models, researchers have demonstrated that word representations can be more effectively adapted to educational tasks, such as reading comprehension and text analysis [9]. This has enabled more accurate modeling of student texts, facilitating tasks like automated essay scoring and content summarization. Moreover, the success of these models has spurred interest in how similar techniques can be applied to other educational challenges, including the analysis of student interactions and the development of adaptive learning systems. In parallel, research on data-driven approaches in education has underscored the importance of rigorous evaluation methods, particularly in the context of predicting student outcomes such as dropout rates. Studies have shown that clickstream data, which captures user interactions with learning platforms, often outperforms other forms of data, such as forum discussions or assignment submissions, in predictive models [12]. This has led to the development of statistical frameworks for evaluating model performance, ensuring that educational technologies are not only effective but also reliable. These evaluations are essential in guiding the deployment of LLMs in real-world educational settings, where accuracy and fairness are paramount. Another important trend has been the exploration of inductive biases and data efficiency in learning. Research has shown that even simple neural networks can develop meaningful inductive biases, such as shape bias, with minimal training data, suggesting that similar principles could be applied to educational models to improve their generalization capabilities [11]. This is particularly relevant in education, where data availability can be limited, and models must often perform well with small or imbalanced datasets. Furthermore, the use of transfer learning and cross-dataset instance retrieval has shown promise in enhancing model performance by leveraging knowledge from related domains [10]. These techniques have the potential to reduce the need for large, domain-specific training data, making LLMs more accessible for educational applications. The broader implications of these developments are significant. As LLMs become more sophisticated, their ability to understand and generate human-like text opens new possibilities for educational tools, such as intelligent tutoring systems, automated content creation, and adaptive assessments. However, challenges remain, including the need for scalable and adaptable models that can function across diverse educational contexts, as well as the computational demands of large-scale language models in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, the ethical and pedagogical implications of using such models in education must be carefully considered, ensuring that they support, rather than replace, human instruction. As the field continues to evolve, interdisciplinary collaboration between educators, computer scientists, and cognitive researchers will be essential in shaping the next generation of educational technologies powered by large language models.

## Current State of the Art

The current state of the art in large language models (LLMs) within the domain of education reflects a growing intersection between natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and educational technology. Recent advances have demonstrated the potential of LLMs to enhance various aspects of the educational experience, from personalized learning to automated assessment and data-driven decision-making. A significant body of research has focused on improving the efficiency, interpretability, and adaptability of language models to better serve educational applications. For instance, syntax-aware language modeling approaches have explored the integration of syntactic information into neural LMs, showing that incorporating external parsers and sequential Monte Carlo sampling can lead to improved performance, particularly at the character level [17]. This suggests that linguistic structure can play a crucial role in enhancing the modeling of language in educational contexts, where syntactic accuracy often correlates with comprehension and learning outcomes. Another notable development is the emergence of neural lattice language models, which model information flow at multiple granularities, such as words and multi-word expressions [18]. These models have shown substantial improvements in perplexity, particularly for languages with complex morphological structures like Chinese. This highlights the importance of multi-granular modeling in capturing the nuances of language, which is especially relevant in educational settings where students may encounter a wide range of linguistic structures. Furthermore, the incorporation of polysemy and multi-character tokens in these models underscores the value of linguistic diversity in enhancing the robustness of language models for educational applications. In parallel, the application of learning analytics in massive open online courses (MOOCs) has demonstrated the utility of data-driven insights in understanding and improving student engagement and learning outcomes [16]. By integrating behavioral data such as forum participation and video interactions, these frameworks provide actionable insights that can inform instructional design and personalized learning strategies. This trend reflects a broader shift toward using large-scale educational data to support adaptive and responsive learning environments, where language models can play a central role in analyzing and predicting student performance. Efforts to improve the efficiency of language models have also gained traction, particularly through the reuse of weights in subword-aware models [14]. These approaches have achieved significant reductions in model parameters while maintaining or even improving performance across multiple languages. This is particularly relevant in educational applications where computational resources may be limited, and compact, scalable models are essential for deployment in diverse learning environments. The focus on parameter reduction and model compression aligns with the broader goal of making LLMs more accessible and practical for real-world educational use cases. In addition, the reinterpretation of topic modeling as a neighborhood aggregation problem has opened new avenues for enhancing the interpretability and flexibility of language models [13]. By integrating pre-trained embeddings and supervisory signals, these models offer a more dynamic and context-aware approach to understanding educational content. This development is particularly valuable in educational settings where the ability to identify and categorize topics accurately can support curriculum design, content recommendation, and student support systems. Across these developments, a common theme is the integration of linguistic structure into language models, whether through syntax, subword units, or multi-granular representations. This reflects a growing recognition of the importance of linguistic features in improving the performance and applicability of LLMs in educational contexts. Moreover, the emphasis on efficiency, scalability, and interpretability underscores the need for models that are not only powerful but also practical and adaptable to the diverse needs of learners and educators. The current landscape also reveals a shift toward interdisciplinary approaches, where NLP techniques are combined with educational theory and data analytics to create more effective and user-centered systems. This trend is evident in the use of language models for tasks such as student performance evaluation, where techniques like PSO-based fuzzy markup languages have been applied to assess learning outcomes [15]. These applications highlight the potential of LLMs to support not only content generation and analysis but also the evaluation and feedback processes that are central to effective education. Overall, the current state of the art in large language models for education demonstrates a rich and evolving field, characterized by a focus on linguistic structure, efficiency, and interdisciplinary integration. As research continues to advance, the potential for LLMs to transform educational practices and outcomes remains a promising and active area of exploration.

## Future Directions

The future of large language models (LLMs) in education is poised to be shaped by several key directions, informed by the evolving landscape of natural language processing and the growing need for personalized, scalable, and interpretable educational technologies. One of the most promising areas of development lies in the integration of linguistic features beyond mere lexical patterns. Recent work has demonstrated the value of incorporating syntactic information into language models, as seen in studies that enhance character-level modeling through syntactic parsing [17]. This suggests that future models may benefit from a more structured approach, where syntactic and semantic cues are explicitly encoded to improve performance in educational applications such as automated essay scoring, reading comprehension, and language learning. Efficiency and scalability remain critical challenges, particularly as educational datasets grow in size and complexity. The ability to train and deploy large-scale models in real-time educational environments is essential. Research on scalable inference techniques, such as stochastic variational inference and sparse Gaussian process approximations, offers a pathway toward more efficient model training and deployment [20]. These methods could enable the development of adaptive learning systems that respond dynamically to student input without requiring excessive computational resources. Interpretability and usability are also central to the future of LLMs in education. As these models become more integrated into educational platforms, it is crucial that they remain transparent and explainable. Studies on scrutinizable models, such as those applied to course recommendation systems, highlight the importance of user-facing explanations and model interpretability [21]. Future research should focus on developing frameworks that allow educators and students to understand and trust the decisions made by these models, ensuring that they serve as tools for empowerment rather than opaque black boxes. Dynamic and evolving models represent another important direction. The ability to track and model changing trends in educational content, student behavior, and pedagogical approaches is essential for creating adaptive learning systems. Dynamic topic models, which use Gaussian processes to capture temporal patterns, provide a foundation for such capabilities [20]. These models could be leveraged to monitor shifts in curriculum, student engagement, and learning outcomes over time, enabling data-driven instructional strategies. Cross-domain adaptation is also a key area of exploration. While many current models are trained on specific educational corpora, there is significant potential for models to generalize across different domains and contexts. This includes adapting to diverse subject areas, cultural contexts, and educational levels. The flexibility demonstrated by models such as Mittens, which extend word embeddings to domain-specific representations, suggests that future LLMs could be more easily tailored to specific educational needs [22]. Moreover, the integration of multimodal and interactive learning environments presents an exciting frontier. As educational technologies increasingly combine text, audio, and visual elements, future models must be capable of processing and generating content across modalities. This aligns with advances in neural text generation and speech synthesis, which have shown promise in creating more immersive and interactive learning experiences [19]. Such models could support a wider range of educational activities, from interactive storytelling to real-time language tutoring. Finally, the ethical and pedagogical implications of LLMs in education must be carefully considered. As these models become more prevalent, issues such as bias, fairness, and the impact on student autonomy will require rigorous investigation. Future work should emphasize the development of ethical frameworks that guide the responsible use of LLMs in educational settings, ensuring that they enhance, rather than replace, human-centered teaching practices.
