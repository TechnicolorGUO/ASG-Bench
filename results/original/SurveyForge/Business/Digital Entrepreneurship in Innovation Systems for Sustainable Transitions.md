Through this exploration, the paper aspires to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on digital innovation and sustainability while offering insights that can inform future research and policy initiatives.

## 2 Theoretical and Conceptual Foundations

### 2.1 Theoretical Perspectives on Innovation Systems and Digital Transformation

The interplay between innovation systems and digital transformation is a critical area of inquiry for understanding sustainable transitions in contemporary societies. Innovation systems, defined as networks of interacting actors and institutions that generate, diffuse, and apply new knowledge, are increasingly shaped by digital technologies that redefine traditional modes of production, collaboration, and governance. This subsection explores the theoretical underpinnings that explain how these systems evolve in response to digital transformation, emphasizing the role of technological advancement, socio-economic structures, and the dynamics of innovation ecosystems.

At the core of this analysis is the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP), a framework that conceptualizes innovation as a process occurring across three levels: the socio-technical regime, the landscape, and the niches [10]. The socio-technical regime refers to the dominant set of practices, technologies, and institutions that shape the current state of an innovation system, while the landscape encompasses broader societal, economic, and environmental conditions. Niches, in contrast, represent spaces where new technologies and practices emerge and are tested. Digital transformation challenges the stability of the socio-technical regime by introducing disruptive technologies that can create new niches and, over time, potentially alter the landscape. This dynamic process is further elucidated by actor-network theory, which emphasizes the agency of both human and non-human actors in shaping innovation trajectories [11].

Digital technologies, particularly those associated with the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain, are reshaping innovation systems by enabling new forms of collaboration and knowledge sharing. These technologies are not merely tools for efficiency but are transforming the very architecture of innovation ecosystems. For instance, the emergence of digital platforms has facilitated the co-creation of value among diverse stakeholders, including firms, researchers, and end-users [12]. This shift from linear to networked innovation models has significant implications for sustainability, as it allows for more flexible and responsive systems that can adapt to changing environmental and social conditions.

Theoretical models that integrate digital innovation with sustainable development include the resource-based view and dynamic capabilities theory. The resource-based view posits that sustainable competitive advantage arises from the unique resources and capabilities of firms, while dynamic capabilities theory emphasizes the ability of organizations to adapt and reconfigure their resources in response to environmental changes [10]. These frameworks provide a basis for understanding how digital technologies can be leveraged to build resilience and foster long-term sustainability in innovation systems.

Despite the growing body of literature, several challenges remain in integrating digital transformation with sustainable innovation systems. These include the need for more interdisciplinary research, the development of comprehensive sustainability assessment frameworks, and the consideration of socio-technical interactions in policy design. Future research should focus on these areas to ensure that digital innovation contributes meaningfully to sustainable transitions.

### 2.2 Conceptual Models of Sustainable Transitions and Their Relevance to Digital Innovation

Digital innovation plays a pivotal role in driving sustainable transitions, offering novel solutions to complex environmental, social, and economic challenges. To understand this interplay, conceptual models of sustainable transitions provide a critical framework for analyzing how systemic change occurs and how digital technologies can contribute to these transitions. These models, including the socio-technical transitions theory (STT) and the multi-level perspective (MLP), emphasize the co-evolution of technological, social, and institutional factors in shaping sustainability outcomes. The MLP, for instance, conceptualizes transitions as emerging from the interaction of niches, regimes, and landscapes, where digital innovation often functions as a disruptive force within niches, challenging existing regimes and influencing broader societal change [1].  

The integration of digital technologies into sustainable transitions is further supported by the concept of digital sustainability, which extends traditional sustainability frameworks to include the environmental and social impacts of digital systems. This approach highlights the need for a holistic assessment of digital innovation, recognizing that while digital solutions can enhance resource efficiency and enable new forms of collaboration, they also introduce challenges such as increased energy consumption and digital divides [1]. Studies have shown that digital tools such as AI, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) can significantly contribute to sustainable development by enabling real-time monitoring, optimizing resource use, and promoting transparency in supply chains [1]. However, these benefits must be balanced against the potential trade-offs, such as data privacy concerns and the carbon footprint of digital infrastructure [1].  

The relevance of digital innovation to sustainable transitions is further underscored by the emergence of digital platforms that facilitate collaborative and open innovation. These platforms enable the co-creation of solutions across diverse stakeholders, fostering a more inclusive and adaptive approach to sustainability [1]. Moreover, the application of complexity theory and network analysis has revealed that digital innovation systems are inherently dynamic, with interactions between actors and technologies leading to emergent properties that shape the trajectory of sustainability transitions [5].  

As the field of digital entrepreneurship continues to evolve, future research should focus on developing more comprehensive frameworks for assessing the sustainability impacts of digital innovations. This includes integrating multi-dimensional indicators that capture both environmental and socio-economic outcomes, as well as exploring the role of policy and governance in shaping the trajectory of digital sustainability [2]. By bridging the gap between digital innovation and sustainable transitions, researchers and practitioners can contribute to the development of more resilient and equitable systems for the future.

### 2.3 The Role of Socio-Technical Systems in Shaping Digital Entrepreneurial Activities

Socio-technical systems refer to the interplay between human and technological elements, where the design, deployment, and use of digital tools are embedded within broader social, cultural, and institutional frameworks. Digital entrepreneurs operate within these systems, where the interdependencies between technological infrastructure, human behavior, and organizational structures determine the viability, scalability, and sustainability of their ventures. This subsection explores these dynamics, emphasizing how socio-technical configurations both enable and constrain entrepreneurial activity.

At the core of socio-technical systems is the idea that digital technologies are not isolated artifacts but are deeply embedded in social practices, institutional norms, and power relations. The adoption and integration of digital tools depend on the readiness of individuals, organizations, and communities to engage with them. For instance, the success of digital platforms hinges on the alignment of technological capabilities with user expectations and cultural norms [1]. Moreover, the governance of digital systems—whether through formal institutions or informal networks—shapes the conditions under which entrepreneurship thrives. For example, regulatory environments that support data privacy and digital inclusion foster trust and enable more diverse participation in digital ecosystems [1].

The structure of socio-technical systems also influences the scalability of digital ventures. Digital entrepreneurs often face challenges in adapting their solutions to different socio-economic and cultural contexts, where the availability of digital infrastructure, the level of digital literacy, and the presence of supportive networks play pivotal roles [1]. The scalability of digital solutions, therefore, is not merely a technical issue but a socio-technical one, requiring alignment with local needs and institutional capacities. This is evident in the case of open-source software (OSS) projects, where the sustainability of initiatives depends on the interplay between technical governance, community engagement, and institutional support [5].

Moreover, the evolution of socio-technical systems is influenced by feedback loops and emergent properties. As digital entrepreneurs experiment with new business models and technologies, they contribute to the reconfiguration of the socio-technical landscape, which in turn shapes future entrepreneurial opportunities. This dynamic interplay underscores the need for adaptive and reflexive approaches to digital entrepreneurship, where actors continuously negotiate the boundaries between technological possibility and social demand [3].

In conclusion, the role of socio-technical systems in shaping digital entrepreneurial activities is multifaceted, involving complex interactions between technology, people, and institutions. Understanding these dynamics is essential for developing strategies that support sustainable digital innovation. Future research should focus on how socio-technical systems can be designed or reconfigured to better support digital entrepreneurs, particularly in contexts of inequality and resource constraints. This requires not only technical innovation but also a deeper understanding of the social and institutional dimensions of digital ecosystems.

One prominent theoretical approach is the application of sustainable business model frameworks, which emphasize value creation through environmental and social responsibility [1]. These models integrate sustainability into core business components such as value propositions, revenue streams, and customer relationships, ensuring that digital ventures contribute positively to both economic and ecological outcomes. For instance, the triple bottom line approach—encompassing people, planet, and profit—has been widely adopted to evaluate the holistic impact of digital entrepreneurship [1]. 

Sustainability metrics and indicators are also being developed to assess the environmental and social impacts of digital ventures. These metrics help entrepreneurs and stakeholders make informed decisions by providing data-driven insights into resource efficiency, waste reduction, and social equity [1]. However, the development of robust and standardized metrics remains a challenge, as the dynamic and multifaceted nature of digital systems complicates the measurement of sustainability outcomes [1].

The alignment of digital entrepreneurship with sustainability goals is not without challenges. Trade-offs between innovation, growth, and ecological impact often arise, necessitating careful balancing of competing priorities [5]. Emerging frameworks, such as the circular economy model, offer promising solutions by promoting resource efficiency and reducing waste through reuse, recycling, and regeneration [2]. These models encourage digital entrepreneurs to design products and services that minimize environmental harm while maximizing long-term value.

In practice, the integration of sustainability principles into digital entrepreneurship frameworks is being shaped by a growing emphasis on socio-technical systems and collaborative ecosystems. These systems recognize the interdependencies between technological infrastructure, human behavior, and organizational structures, highlighting the need for inclusive and participatory approaches to innovation [1]. Furthermore, the use of digital platforms and infrastructures to enable or constrain entrepreneurial activities underscores the importance of designing systems that support sustainable practices [2].

Looking ahead, the integration of sustainability into digital entrepreneurship frameworks will require continued interdisciplinary research and innovation. Future directions include the development of more comprehensive and adaptive frameworks that can accommodate the complexities of digital systems and their interactions with socio-technical environments [6].

The core of these strategies lies in embedding sustainability into the business model logic, leveraging digital technologies to optimize value creation, and fostering collaborative ecosystems that support systemic change [1].  

One prominent approach is the integration of sustainability into core business model components, such as value propositions, revenue streams, and customer relationships. Digital entrepreneurs prioritize value propositions that emphasize environmental and social outcomes, such as reduced carbon footprints, circular economy practices, and social inclusion [1]. For instance, platforms that enable resource sharing, like ride-sharing or peer-to-peer lending, exemplify how digital business models can create value by reducing waste and enhancing access to services. Moreover, revenue models are being restructured to support green innovation, such as subscription-based services that incentivize sustainable consumption and reduce product lifecycle impacts [1].  

Another critical strategy involves the use of data and analytics for sustainable decision-making. Digital entrepreneurs leverage big data and artificial intelligence to monitor and optimize resource use, predict environmental impacts, and identify opportunities for improvement. For example, predictive analytics can help companies reduce energy consumption and waste by forecasting demand and adjusting production accordingly [1]. This data-driven approach not only enhances operational efficiency but also enables transparency and accountability, crucial for building trust with stakeholders.  

Furthermore, digital entrepreneurs are increasingly focusing on stakeholder collaboration and co-creation to ensure that their strategies address the needs of diverse groups, including communities, governments, and civil society. Platforms that facilitate knowledge exchange and collective action, such as open-source initiatives and crowdsourcing, demonstrate how digital tools can enable bottom-up innovation and inclusivity [1]. These collaborative strategies enhance the scalability and sustainability of digital solutions, as they are more likely to be adopted and adapted to local contexts.  

Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including the need for robust frameworks to assess the sustainability impact of digital ventures and the trade-offs between innovation, growth, and ecological impact [5]. Future research should focus on developing comprehensive metrics and models that capture the complex interdependencies between digital innovation and sustainability outcomes. By addressing these challenges, digital entrepreneurs can continue to drive value creation that aligns with the principles of sustainable development.

### 4.4 Empirical Insights from Sustainable Digital Entrepreneurial Ventures

Empirical evidence from sustainable digital entrepreneurial ventures reveals a growing trend of integrating sustainability into business models, driven by both market demand and regulatory pressures. These ventures leverage digital technologies to create value while addressing environmental and social challenges. For instance, case studies of platforms like Nosh, an indie food delivery service, highlight the importance of human intervention in maintaining a sustainable and respectful user experience [36]. Such ventures often emphasize local contexts and community engagement, differentiating them from large-scale, transnational platforms. This approach not only fosters user trust but also enhances the resilience of the digital ecosystem. Similarly, research on the sustainability of open-source software projects underscores the critical role of institutional governance and socio-technical networks in ensuring long-term viability [37]. By analyzing longitudinal collaboration records, scholars have identified how institutional rules and norms interact with the day-to-day activities of contributors, shaping the evolution of these projects. These insights highlight the need for a dual-view analysis that combines institutional and socio-technical perspectives.

The empirical analysis of sustainable digital ventures also reveals challenges in scaling and maintaining sustainability. For example, a study on the Apache Software Foundation Incubator projects demonstrated that while certain socio-technical network trajectories correlate with project sustainability, the accuracy of predictive models remains limited [19]. This suggests that while data-driven approaches can provide valuable insights, they must be complemented by qualitative assessments and adaptive strategies. Moreover, the integration of sustainability metrics into digital business models presents both opportunities and trade-offs. While frameworks such as the triple bottom line and circular economy provide a structured approach, they often require significant adjustments to existing business practices [38].

Emerging trends in sustainable digital entrepreneurship point to the importance of stakeholder collaboration and co-creation. Platforms that facilitate resource sharing and open innovation, such as those analyzed in the context of the OpenStack ecosystem, demonstrate the potential for scalable and inclusive solutions [39]. However, these models also face challenges in balancing profitability with social and environmental goals. As the field continues to evolve, future research should focus on developing more robust evaluation frameworks and exploring the long-term socio-ecological impacts of digital innovations. By synthesizing these insights, scholars and practitioners can better navigate the complexities of sustainable digital entrepreneurship and contribute to the broader goal of systemic sustainability.

## 5 Stakeholder Interactions and Collaborative Ecosystems

### 5.1 Stakeholder Roles and Network Dynamics

The digital entrepreneurship ecosystem is characterized by a dynamic interplay among diverse stakeholders, each playing a distinct role in shaping sustainable transitions. Entrepreneurs act as initiators and coordinators of digital innovation, leveraging technological capabilities to address societal and environmental challenges [1]. Their ability to identify opportunities and mobilize resources is critical in driving the development of sustainable solutions. However, their impact is significantly influenced by the broader network in which they operate. Investors and venture capitalists play a pivotal role in funding and scaling sustainable digital ventures, often shaping the direction and trajectory of entrepreneurial activities through their financial and strategic support [40]. Their decisions are not merely driven by profit motives but increasingly influenced by the potential for long-term environmental and social impact, as evidenced by the rise of sustainable venture capital models [1].

Governments and regulatory bodies are instrumental in creating the policy environment that either facilitates or hinders digital entrepreneurship. Through regulatory frameworks, public-private partnerships, and incentive structures, they can either catalyze or constrain the growth of sustainable digital initiatives [1]. Effective governance requires a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring that digital solutions align with broader sustainability goals. Civil society and community groups, on the other hand, contribute by advocating for inclusive and equitable digital solutions, ensuring that the voices of marginalized communities are heard and integrated into the innovation process [41]. Their involvement is essential in addressing the social dimensions of sustainability and ensuring that digital solutions are contextually relevant and socially acceptable.

The interactions among these stakeholders form complex network dynamics that influence the trajectory of digital entrepreneurship. These dynamics are shaped by the flow of knowledge, resources, and influence, with each stakeholder contributing to the overall ecosystem. For instance, the integration of digital technologies in sustainable practices often requires collaboration between entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers to address technical, economic, and regulatory challenges [1]. The emergence of digital platforms as facilitators of collaboration and knowledge sharing further enhances the interconnectedness of these stakeholder networks, enabling real-time communication and decision-making [42]. However, the effectiveness of these networks is contingent upon the alignment of interests, the availability of resources, and the presence of trust and transparency among participants.

Emerging trends in stakeholder interactions highlight the need for adaptive governance frameworks that can respond to the dynamic nature of digital ecosystems and sustainability challenges [1]. These frameworks must account for the evolving roles of stakeholders, the increasing complexity of digital systems, and the need for inclusive and participatory decision-making processes. Future research should focus on developing robust methodologies for analyzing stakeholder interactions and network dynamics, with a particular emphasis on their impact on sustainable transitions. This will require interdisciplinary approaches that integrate insights from sociology, economics, and technology studies to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that drive sustainable digital entrepreneurship. By fostering a deeper understanding of these dynamics, stakeholders can better navigate the challenges and opportunities inherent in the digital entrepreneurship landscape, ultimately contributing to more resilient and equitable innovation ecosystems.

### 5.2 Cross-Sectoral Collaboration Mechanisms

Cross-sectoral collaboration mechanisms are pivotal in fostering sustainable digital innovation by integrating diverse stakeholder perspectives, resources, and capabilities. These mechanisms enable the co-creation of solutions that transcend traditional boundaries, leveraging the unique strengths of public, private, and civil society actors. Central to this process are public-private partnerships (PPPs), co-creation initiatives, and multi-stakeholder platforms, each offering distinct approaches to address the complex challenges of sustainable digital entrepreneurship [1]. 

Public-private partnerships provide a structured framework for collaboration, where government entities and private enterprises work together to align their strategic goals with broader societal objectives. This partnership model facilitates the pooling of resources, risk-sharing, and the creation of policy environments conducive to innovation [1]. However, the success of PPPs often hinges on the ability to balance competing interests and ensure transparency, which can be challenging given the differing priorities of stakeholders [43]. Despite these challenges, studies have shown that well-designed PPPs can lead to significant advancements in digital infrastructure and sustainable practices [2].

Co-creation initiatives further enhance collaborative ecosystems by involving end-users, communities, and other stakeholders in the innovation process. This participatory approach ensures that solutions are tailored to local needs and contexts, thereby increasing their relevance and impact [42]. For example, co-creation models have been successfully implemented in the development of digital tools for environmental monitoring and resource management, where input from diverse stakeholders leads to more effective and sustainable outcomes [1]. However, co-creation also necessitates a high degree of engagement and communication, which can be resource-intensive and may require the development of new facilitation tools and methodologies [41].

Multi-stakeholder platforms serve as intermediaries that connect various actors, facilitating knowledge exchange, resource sharing, and collective decision-making. These platforms are particularly effective in fostering collaboration across sectors and geographies, as they provide a neutral space for dialogue and negotiation [1]. The effectiveness of such platforms often depends on their governance structures and the extent to which they can balance the interests of different stakeholders [44]. Additionally, the use of digital technologies within these platforms enhances their capacity to manage large volumes of data and support real-time collaboration, further amplifying their impact [1].

Emerging trends in cross-sectoral collaboration emphasize the need for adaptive and flexible frameworks that can respond to the dynamic nature of digital innovation. As the landscape of digital entrepreneurship continues to evolve, the ability to form and sustain collaborative partnerships will be critical in driving sustainable transitions [1]. Future research should focus on the development of more robust evaluation metrics and the identification of best practices that can guide the implementation of these mechanisms in diverse contexts [8]. By addressing these challenges and opportunities, cross-sectoral collaboration can play a transformative role in advancing sustainable digital innovation.

### 5.3 Institutional and Governance Frameworks

Institutional and governance frameworks play a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of stakeholder interactions within digital entrepreneurship ecosystems. These frameworks encompass both formal rules, such as policies, regulations, and legal structures, as well as informal norms, cultural values, and social capital that collectively influence the sustainability and effectiveness of collaborative efforts. As digital entrepreneurship increasingly intersects with sustainability goals, the institutional and governance contexts become critical in determining how stakeholders engage, share resources, and co-create value. The interplay between formal and informal governance mechanisms significantly affects the scalability, resilience, and long-term viability of digital initiatives, particularly in complex and multi-actor environments [1; 3].

Formal institutional structures, such as regulatory bodies, public-private partnerships, and national innovation policies, provide the foundational legal and policy environment that either facilitates or constrains digital entrepreneurship. For instance, policy frameworks that promote open data, digital literacy, and access to infrastructure can enhance the inclusivity and reach of digital initiatives. Conversely, fragmented or overly restrictive regulations may hinder innovation by creating compliance burdens and discouraging cross-sector collaboration [1; 1]. Moreover, the governance of digital platforms—whether centralized or decentralized—determines the balance of power among stakeholders, influencing how resources are distributed, how decisions are made, and how accountability is ensured. Platforms that prioritize participatory governance and transparent decision-making mechanisms tend to foster more inclusive and equitable ecosystems [2].

Informal governance, on the other hand, refers to the social norms, trust relationships, and cultural practices that shape stakeholder interactions. These informal mechanisms often complement or even override formal structures, particularly in contexts where institutional capacity is limited. Trust, for example, is a crucial enabler of collaboration, as it reduces transaction costs and facilitates knowledge sharing among diverse actors. Research has shown that strong social networks and embedded institutional relationships can significantly enhance the resilience of digital ecosystems, especially in times of uncertainty or disruption [1; 1]. However, informal governance can also reinforce existing power imbalances and exclusionary practices, particularly in regions with weak institutional frameworks.

The integration of both formal and informal governance mechanisms is essential for creating adaptive and responsive ecosystems that can navigate the complexities of digital sustainability. Emerging trends suggest a growing emphasis on hybrid governance models that combine top-down regulatory frameworks with bottom-up participatory approaches. Such models not only enhance the legitimacy and effectiveness of digital initiatives but also ensure that they align with broader societal and environmental goals [3; 1]. Future research should further explore the dynamics of these hybrid frameworks, particularly in the context of global South and resource-constrained settings, where institutional capacity and informal networks often play a more pronounced role in shaping digital entrepreneurship.

### 5.4 Community Engagement and Participatory Innovation

Community engagement and participatory innovation are increasingly recognized as critical components in the development of digital solutions that support sustainable transitions. This subsection examines the role of community involvement in shaping digital entrepreneurship, emphasizing how participatory approaches can enhance the relevance, impact, and long-term viability of digital initiatives. By involving local communities, users, and end-users in the innovation process, digital entrepreneurs can create solutions that are more attuned to local needs, values, and contexts, thereby fostering greater acceptance and sustainability [2].

Participatory innovation involves the active collaboration of stakeholders throughout the design, development, and implementation of digital technologies. This approach aligns with the principles of socio-technical systems, where the interplay between technological and social factors shapes the outcomes of innovation [13]. For instance, studies on citizen science platforms highlight how co-creation between scientists and the general public can lead to more meaningful and impactful research outcomes [2]. Similarly, in the context of digital entrepreneurship, participatory methods allow for the integration of community-based knowledge and practices, ensuring that digital solutions are culturally and contextually appropriate [2].

One of the key benefits of community engagement is the enhancement of inclusivity and equity in digital innovation. By involving underrepresented groups, digital entrepreneurs can address existing power imbalances and ensure that technological solutions do not exacerbate social inequalities. This is particularly important in the context of sustainability, where the environmental and social impacts of digital technologies must be carefully considered [7]. Research on the digital divide underscores the need for strategies that promote equitable access to digital resources and opportunities, particularly in low-income and marginalized communities [3].

However, participatory innovation also presents challenges, including the need to balance the diverse interests and priorities of various stakeholders. While community involvement can lead to more holistic and sustainable solutions, it may also complicate the innovation process and slow down decision-making [2]. Moreover, the scalability of community-driven initiatives remains a significant challenge, as local solutions may not always translate effectively to broader contexts [1]. Despite these challenges, emerging trends suggest that digital platforms and collaborative tools can facilitate more effective and scalable forms of community engagement, enabling broader participation and knowledge sharing [1].

In conclusion, community engagement and participatory innovation are essential for ensuring that digital solutions contribute meaningfully to sustainable transitions. Future research should focus on developing more robust frameworks for measuring the impact of participatory approaches, as well as exploring how digital technologies can be leveraged to enhance community participation and inclusivity. By integrating community voices into the innovation process, digital entrepreneurs can create more resilient and equitable solutions that align with the goals of sustainable development.

### 5.5 Digital Platforms as Enablers of Collaboration

These platforms, ranging from open-source communities to enterprise-grade digital marketplaces, have redefined how actors engage in innovation, particularly in the context of sustainable transitions. By lowering barriers to entry, enhancing transparency, and fostering scalable solutions, digital platforms play a critical role in shaping the collaborative dynamics of digital entrepreneurship. This subsection explores the multifaceted role of digital platforms in facilitating stakeholder interactions, drawing on empirical insights and theoretical perspectives from recent scholarship.

One of the primary functions of digital platforms is their ability to connect actors across traditional boundaries. As highlighted in the work on platform-based entrepreneurship [1], platforms enable resource sharing, open innovation, and collective action, thereby promoting collaborative sustainability. This is particularly evident in the case of digital ecosystems, where platforms serve as hubs for data, tools, and expertise, allowing stakeholders to co-create solutions that address complex sustainability challenges. For instance, in the context of circular economy initiatives, platforms like IDEAL-CITIES [1] facilitate the exchange of data and resources between urban stakeholders, supporting the development of closed-loop systems that optimize resource use and reduce environmental impact.

Moreover, digital platforms are instrumental in enhancing transparency and accountability through the use of data analytics and blockchain technologies. Research on blockchain for transparency in sustainable practices [1] demonstrates how these platforms can track and verify the sustainability of supply chains, ensuring that digital entrepreneurship aligns with ethical and environmental standards. Similarly, the application of data analytics in digital ecosystems [1] underscores the potential for platforms to provide real-time insights that inform decision-making and enhance stakeholder engagement.

However, the governance of digital platforms presents both opportunities and challenges. The design of platform governance mechanisms, as explored in studies on platform ecosystems [1], plays a crucial role in determining the inclusiveness and fairness of collaborative efforts. Effective governance structures must balance the interests of diverse stakeholders, ensuring that platforms do not become exclusive or monopolistic. This is particularly important in the context of sustainable digital entrepreneurship, where equitable access to resources and knowledge is essential for long-term impact.

In conclusion, digital platforms serve as essential facilitators of collaboration in the digital entrepreneurship ecosystem, enabling stakeholder interactions that drive innovation and sustainability. Their role in connecting actors, fostering knowledge exchange, and ensuring transparency underscores their importance in shaping the future of collaborative innovation. Future research should focus on developing more inclusive and adaptive platform governance models, as well as exploring the long-term socio-ecological impacts of digital platforms in sustainable development.

## 6 Challenges and Barriers to Digital Entrepreneurship for Sustainability

In conclusion, the technological and infrastructural barriers to digital entrepreneurship for sustainability are complex and interrelated, demanding a holistic and innovative approach to overcome. By addressing these challenges, stakeholders can unlock the full potential of digital tools in driving sustainable transitions.

### 6.2 Regulatory and Policy Challenges

Digital entrepreneurship for sustainability is increasingly constrained by regulatory and policy challenges that hinder innovation and scalability. These challenges manifest in the form of inconsistent legal frameworks, complex compliance requirements, and inadequate policy support, which collectively create a fragmented environment for digital entrepreneurs seeking to implement sustainable solutions [10]. One of the primary obstacles is the absence of clear and unified regulatory standards for digital technologies, particularly in areas such as data privacy, cybersecurity, and digital taxation. This lack of clarity creates uncertainty for entrepreneurs, who must navigate a patchwork of national and regional regulations that often conflict with one another [45]. Inconsistent enforcement further exacerbates these issues, as regulatory bodies may lack the capacity or resources to monitor and enforce compliance effectively, especially in rapidly evolving digital ecosystems [46].

Another critical challenge lies in the complexity of the regulatory environment itself. Digital entrepreneurs often face a web of overlapping and conflicting policies that span multiple sectors, including technology, environment, and business. For instance, while some countries have introduced policies to support green innovation and digital inclusion, others lack the institutional capacity or political will to implement such initiatives effectively [47]. This inconsistency not only complicates the regulatory landscape but also creates barriers for cross-border digital ventures, as entrepreneurs must adapt their strategies to meet varying compliance standards in different jurisdictions [48]. Moreover, the rapid pace of technological change often outstrips the ability of policymakers to keep up, resulting in regulatory gaps that leave emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain in a legal gray area [49].

Policy frameworks that fail to account for the unique characteristics of digital entrepreneurship further compound these challenges. Traditional regulatory approaches, which were designed for conventional industries, often fail to address the dynamic and networked nature of digital innovation. This misalignment can stifle the development of sustainable digital solutions, as entrepreneurs may find themselves constrained by outdated or overly rigid regulatory structures [50]. Additionally, the lack of support for digital inclusion and equitable access to digital resources exacerbates the digital divide, limiting the reach and impact of sustainable digital ventures [20].

To address these challenges, there is a pressing need for more agile and adaptive regulatory frameworks that can keep pace with technological innovation while promoting sustainability. Policymakers must also prioritize the development of coordinated international standards and mechanisms for cross-border compliance, ensuring that digital entrepreneurs can operate effectively in a globalized environment [45]. Ultimately, the successful integration of digital entrepreneurship into sustainable transitions will depend on the ability of regulatory and policy systems to evolve in tandem with technological and societal changes.

### 6.3 Financial and Resource Constraints

Digital entrepreneurship for sustainability faces significant financial and resource constraints that impede the growth and scalability of sustainable digital ventures. These constraints stem from a combination of limited access to capital, high initial investment requirements, and the need for sustainable business models that balance innovation with long-term viability. The challenges are compounded by the fact that many digital entrepreneurs operate in resource-constrained environments, particularly in developing regions, where access to funding and infrastructure is limited [1]. This creates a complex ecosystem in which financial and resource barriers act as major deterrents to the adoption and scaling of sustainable digital solutions.

Access to capital remains one of the most critical challenges for digital entrepreneurs aiming to implement sustainable technologies. Traditional funding mechanisms, such as venture capital and bank loans, are often hesitant to invest in early-stage ventures that prioritize sustainability over immediate profitability [1]. This is exacerbated by the fact that sustainable digital initiatives frequently require significant upfront investments in research, development, and infrastructure, which can be prohibitive for resource-constrained entrepreneurs [1]. Moreover, the uncertainty surrounding the return on investment for sustainable technologies further deters potential investors, creating a feedback loop that limits the availability of financial resources for digital entrepreneurs [5].

The high cost of innovation is another major obstacle.

These costs include not only the procurement of hardware and software but also the ongoing maintenance and updates necessary to ensure the longevity and effectiveness of digital solutions. Furthermore, the need for continuous innovation to keep pace with rapid technological changes adds to the financial burden on digital entrepreneurs [43].

Sustainable business models are essential for long-term development, yet many digital entrepreneurs struggle to design and implement such models. The integration of sustainability principles into business models requires a deep understanding of both the environmental and social impacts of digital solutions, as well as the ability to balance these with economic viability [4]. This is a complex task, as it involves navigating trade-offs between innovation, growth, and ecological impact [1]. Emerging frameworks, such as the triple bottom line approach and the circular economy model, offer promising directions, but their practical implementation remains a challenge for many digital entrepreneurs [2].

In conclusion, the financial and resource constraints faced by digital entrepreneurs in the context of sustainability are multifaceted and deeply interrelated. Addressing these challenges requires a combination of innovative financing mechanisms, supportive policy environments, and the development of robust, sustainable business models. Future research should focus on identifying and scaling successful financing strategies and exploring the role of institutional support in fostering sustainable digital entrepreneurship. By doing so, it may be possible to overcome these barriers and enable the widespread adoption of sustainable digital solutions.

### 6.4 Market Dynamics and Competitive Pressures

The subsection on market dynamics and competitive pressures highlights the complex challenges digital entrepreneurs face in achieving sustainability within a rapidly evolving and highly competitive landscape. Market saturation, driven by the proliferation of digital solutions, creates an environment where it becomes increasingly difficult for smaller, sustainability-focused ventures to differentiate themselves and gain traction [1]. This is exacerbated by the dominance of large tech firms, which often have the resources to scale quickly, leverage network effects, and control key digital infrastructures. As a result, smaller digital entrepreneurs are frequently marginalized, struggling to compete on equal footing in a market dominated by industry giants [1].

Consumer behavior further complicates the landscape, as market demands often prioritize convenience and cost over sustainability. While there is growing awareness of environmental and social issues, the inertia of consumer habits, coupled with the lack of accessible, sustainable alternatives, continues to favor traditional, less sustainable business models [1]. This dynamic places additional pressure on digital entrepreneurs to not only innovate but also educate and transform consumer expectations, a task that requires significant investment in marketing, public relations, and stakeholder engagement [1].

Moreover, the rapid pace of technological obsolescence forces digital entrepreneurs to continuously innovate, which can strain limited resources and divert attention from long-term sustainability goals [1]. The pressure to scale quickly and achieve profitability can lead to short-term compromises that undermine the very principles of sustainable development that digital entrepreneurship seeks to advance [1]. This tension between growth and sustainability is particularly acute in the context of digital ventures, where the pursuit of market dominance can clash with the need for ethical and environmental responsibility.

Emerging trends suggest that the market is beginning to recognize the value of sustainability, with some investors and consumers showing a preference for ventures that align with environmental and social goals [1]. However, this shift is still nascent, and the lack of standardized metrics and frameworks for assessing the sustainability impact of digital ventures remains a critical barrier [1]. As the field of digital entrepreneurship for sustainability evolves, there is a pressing need for more robust analytical tools and policy interventions to level the playing field and support the long-term viability of sustainable digital ventures [1].

In conclusion, market dynamics and competitive pressures present significant challenges for digital entrepreneurs focused on sustainability. Addressing these barriers requires a multifaceted approach that includes innovation, education, policy reform, and the development of new metrics to support sustainable digital business models. Future research should explore how these dynamics can be leveraged to create more inclusive and resilient digital ecosystems.

The lack of participatory approaches can lead to a disconnect between the technology and the local context, reducing the likelihood of successful adoption [53]. For example, digital platforms designed without considering local languages, customs, or social structures may not resonate with users, leading to low adoption rates and limited impact.

Culturally appropriate digital interventions are essential to overcome these barriers. Solutions must be tailored to reflect the values, beliefs, and practices of the communities they are intended to support. This requires a deep understanding of the social and cultural context, which can be achieved through participatory design and community-based research [54]. For instance, digital tools that incorporate local knowledge and practices are more likely to be accepted and used effectively [55].

Furthermore, social inequality and digital divides pose significant challenges. Marginalized communities often lack the resources and infrastructure necessary to access and benefit from digital technologies. This digital divide can perpetuate existing inequalities, as those with limited access to digital tools may be left behind in the transition to sustainable digital solutions [56]. Addressing these disparities requires targeted policies and investments to ensure equitable access to digital resources.

In conclusion, social and cultural barriers present complex challenges that require multifaceted solutions. By fostering community engagement, promoting digital literacy, and designing culturally appropriate interventions, digital entrepreneurs can overcome these barriers and enhance the sustainability and impact of their initiatives. Future research should focus on developing scalable and inclusive strategies that address the unique social and cultural contexts of different communities.

The intersection of digital entrepreneurship and sustainability introduces a range of ethical and societal concerns that demand careful scrutiny. As digital technologies become increasingly embedded in sustainable innovation, issues such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for exacerbating social inequalities have emerged as critical challenges. These concerns highlight the need for a balanced approach that ensures the ethical development and deployment of digital solutions without compromising their sustainability goals.

One of the most pressing ethical concerns is data privacy. Digital entrepreneurs often rely on vast amounts of user data to drive innovation and improve services, yet this data collection can infringe on individual privacy rights. The use of personal data for algorithmic decision-making, as discussed in [32], raises questions about transparency, consent, and the potential misuse of sensitive information. Furthermore, the environmental impact of data centers and the energy consumption associated with data processing, as highlighted in [57], adds another layer of complexity to the ethical landscape.

Algorithmic bias is another significant challenge. Machine learning models, which are integral to many digital entrepreneurial ventures, can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities. Studies have shown that biased training data can lead to discriminatory outcomes, as discussed in [58]. This issue is particularly relevant in the context of sustainability, where fairness and inclusivity must be prioritized to ensure that digital solutions benefit all stakeholders.

The potential for digital technologies to exacerbate existing inequalities cannot be overlooked. While digital entrepreneurship offers opportunities for innovation and growth, it also risks deepening the digital divide. Marginalized communities may lack the resources or access needed to benefit from these advancements, as noted in [59]. This disparity can hinder the equitable distribution of sustainability benefits and undermine the inclusive development of digital solutions.

In addressing these ethical and societal concerns, it is essential to adopt a multi-faceted approach. This includes the development of robust ethical frameworks, the implementation of transparent and accountable governance mechanisms, and the promotion of inclusive and participatory design processes. As explored in [60], a value-based assessment framework can help ensure that ethical considerations are integrated into the design and deployment of digital technologies.

Future research should focus on developing more comprehensive tools and methodologies for assessing the ethical and societal impacts of digital entrepreneurship. This includes the creation of standardized metrics for evaluating the fairness, transparency, and inclusivity of digital solutions. Additionally, there is a need for interdisciplinary collaboration that brings together insights from ethics, social sciences, and technology to address the complex challenges of sustainable digital innovation. By addressing these ethical and societal concerns, digital entrepreneurs can contribute to a more equitable and sustainable future.

Furthermore, IoT-based predictive maintenance systems have been found to reduce material waste and energy consumption by enabling timely interventions [1]. These findings underscore the potential of IoT in supporting sustainable practices through real-time monitoring and adaptive management.

Data analytics has emerged as a critical tool for sustainable entrepreneurship, enabling informed decision-making and the identification of sustainability performance gaps. Empirical assessments have demonstrated that data-driven approaches can enhance the efficiency of resource use and improve the sustainability of business models [5]. Additionally, the integration of data analytics with AI and IoT has been shown to enable predictive and prescriptive strategies for sustainable innovation, allowing organizations to anticipate and mitigate environmental and social impacts [2].

Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the adoption and scalability of digital tools for sustainable innovation. Technical barriers such as interoperability and energy consumption of digital systems have been identified as significant obstacles [1]. Economic challenges, including the high initial costs of digital infrastructure and limited access to funding, further hinder the scalability of sustainable digital solutions [2]. Moreover, policy and regulatory frameworks vary widely across regions, creating inconsistencies that complicate the implementation of digital sustainability initiatives [6].

Emerging trends suggest a growing emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches that integrate digital technologies with sustainability principles. Studies have highlighted the importance of collaborative ecosystems and stakeholder engagement in the successful implementation of digital sustainability solutions [13]. Future research should focus on developing comprehensive frameworks for assessing the sustainability impact of digital entrepreneurial ventures and on addressing the long-term socio-ecological implications of digital technologies [2]. By synthesizing empirical evidence and addressing existing gaps, future studies can further advance the understanding of how digital tools contribute to sustainable innovation.

### 7.3 Comparative Case Studies Across Industries and Geographies

Digital entrepreneurship in the context of sustainable transitions exhibits significant variation across industries and geographies, shaped by distinct regulatory, cultural, and infrastructural contexts. Comparative case studies reveal how these contextual factors influence the design, adoption, and scalability of digital ventures, offering insights into the interplay between innovation and sustainability. For instance, the energy sector in Europe has seen the rise of digital platforms that facilitate decentralized renewable energy trading, leveraging blockchain technology to ensure transparency and trust [1]. In contrast, in the Global South, digital initiatives often face infrastructural constraints, such as limited internet access and inadequate power supply, which necessitate context-specific solutions that prioritize affordability and accessibility [1]. These differences underscore the need for adaptive strategies that align with local conditions while adhering to global sustainability standards.

In agriculture, digital entrepreneurship has taken different trajectories. In developed economies, startups like those leveraging IoT for precision farming have demonstrated significant improvements in resource efficiency and yield [6]. However, in regions with limited technological infrastructure, such as parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, mobile-based solutions have emerged as a viable alternative, using SMS and feature phones to disseminate agricultural advice and market prices [1]. Such cases illustrate how digital tools can be tailored to meet the unique needs of diverse markets, emphasizing the importance of co-creation with local stakeholders. Furthermore, the role of public-private partnerships in fostering innovation is evident in both settings, though the nature of collaboration varies. In the Global North, these partnerships often focus on R&D and scaling, while in the Global South, they frequently involve capacity building and technology transfer [5].

The healthcare sector provides another compelling example of the impact of geographies on digital entrepreneurship. In the United States, digital health platforms have leveraged AI and data analytics to improve patient outcomes and operational efficiency [1]. Conversely, in countries with underdeveloped healthcare systems, such as India and Nigeria, digital solutions often prioritize accessibility and affordability, focusing on telemedicine and mobile health applications [1]. These variations highlight the importance of aligning digital strategies with local healthcare needs and infrastructure, while also addressing ethical and regulatory concerns such as data privacy and algorithmic bias [1].

Emerging trends suggest that future digital entrepreneurship in sustainable transitions will increasingly rely on multi-stakeholder collaboration and context-aware innovation. The integration of socio-technical systems and the adoption of adaptive governance frameworks will be crucial in navigating the complexities of digital sustainability. As these case studies demonstrate, the success of digital ventures is deeply intertwined with their ability to respond to local conditions while contributing to broader sustainability goals. Future research should continue to explore the interplay between digital innovation and context-specific factors, providing a deeper understanding of how digital entrepreneurship can drive sustainable transitions globally.

### 7.4 Lessons from Digital Strategy Implementation in Sustainable Transitions

The implementation of digital strategies in sustainable transitions presents a complex interplay of technological, social, and institutional factors that significantly influence the success or failure of such initiatives. Through a synthesis of empirical studies and case analyses, this subsection outlines key lessons that highlight successful practices, common pitfalls, and strategic insights that emerge from these implementations.

One of the central insights is the importance of aligning digital strategies with the broader sustainability goals of an organization. For instance, successful digital entrepreneurship in the context of sustainable transitions often involves the integration of digital tools and platforms with environmental and social metrics, ensuring that technological interventions contribute directly to sustainability outcomes [1]. This integration requires not only technical proficiency but also a deep understanding of the socio-technical dynamics that shape the adoption and use of digital technologies.

Another critical lesson is the recognition of the role of stakeholder engagement and collaboration. The successful implementation of digital strategies is often contingent on the involvement of diverse stakeholders, including communities, policymakers, and industry partners. For example, studies have shown that when digital initiatives are co-designed with local communities, they are more likely to address real needs and gain sustained support [1]. This underscores the importance of participatory approaches that prioritize inclusivity and equity in the design and deployment of digital solutions.

However, despite these successes, several common pitfalls persist. One major challenge is the over-reliance on technological solutions without adequate consideration of the social and institutional contexts in which they operate. This can lead to solutions that are technically sound but socially irrelevant or unsustainable in the long term [5]. Additionally, the lack of robust evaluation frameworks for assessing the sustainability impact of digital strategies remains a significant barrier. As noted in recent research, there is a need for more comprehensive and standardized metrics that capture both the environmental and social dimensions of digital innovation [1].

Emerging trends in digital strategy implementation also highlight the need for adaptive and flexible approaches. The rapid evolution of digital technologies necessitates strategies that can evolve in response to changing conditions and emerging challenges. This requires not only technical agility but also a commitment to continuous learning and improvement [6]. Moreover, the increasing focus on ethical and governance considerations in digital innovation points to the need for a more holistic view of digital strategy that balances innovation with responsibility and accountability [2].

In conclusion, the lessons from digital strategy implementation in sustainable transitions emphasize the importance of alignment with sustainability goals, stakeholder engagement, and adaptive strategies. Future research should continue to explore these dimensions, focusing on the development of more robust evaluation frameworks and the integration of ethical and governance considerations into digital strategy design. These insights are crucial for advancing the field of digital entrepreneurship in innovation systems for sustainable transitions.

## 8 Potential Gaps and Future Research Directions

### 8.1 Interdisciplinary Integration Gaps

The integration of digital entrepreneurship with sustainability frameworks remains a critical gap in current academic discourse, reflecting a broader challenge in interdisciplinary research. While digital technologies are increasingly recognized as enablers of sustainable innovation, the alignment of entrepreneurial activities with broader sustainability goals is often fragmented, lacking a cohesive theoretical and practical foundation [1]. This subsection examines the current limitations in interdisciplinary integration and underscores the urgency of bridging environmental, social, and technological domains to foster more holistic approaches to sustainable transitions.

A key issue lies in the siloed nature of research, where digital entrepreneurship is frequently analyzed through the lens of technological innovation, while sustainability considerations are often treated as secondary or external factors. This separation hinders the development of integrated frameworks that can effectively capture the complex interdependencies between digital innovation and sustainable development [1]. For instance, while many studies focus on the technical capabilities of digital tools, such as artificial intelligence or the Internet of Things, few explore their socio-ecological implications or how they can be harnessed to advance sustainability agendas [1]. This gap is particularly evident in the absence of common metrics and evaluation frameworks that can assess the sustainability impact of digital ventures across multiple dimensions [1].

Moreover, the interdisciplinary nature of sustainability challenges demands a more collaborative approach, integrating insights from environmental science, economics, social sciences, and policy studies. However, the current research landscape often lacks the structural and methodological tools necessary to support such integration. For example, the use of bibliometric analysis and scientometric reviews, while valuable for mapping knowledge domains, rarely incorporates a multi-disciplinary perspective that accounts for the dynamic interplay between technological innovation and social-ecological systems [1]. This limitation is compounded by the over-reliance on Western-centric models, which may not adequately reflect the diverse socio-cultural and economic contexts in which digital entrepreneurship operates [5].

Another critical aspect is the underrepresentation of non-technical dimensions in digital entrepreneurship research. Ethical, cultural, and policy-related issues are often sidelined, despite their significant influence on the adoption and effectiveness of digital solutions. Studies on sustainability in software engineering, for example, highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of how digital innovations interact with social structures and institutional frameworks [2]. Similarly, the role of governance and policy in shaping the trajectory of digital entrepreneurship remains underexplored, particularly in the context of low-income and developing regions [1].

To address these gaps, future research must prioritize interdisciplinary collaboration, fostering dialogue between scholars and practitioners from diverse fields. This includes the development of more comprehensive assessment frameworks, the integration of multi-disciplinary data sources, and the consideration of contextual factors that influence the success and sustainability of digital ventures. By bridging these gaps, the academic community can better support the emergence of digital entrepreneurship as a transformative force in achieving sustainable transitions.

### 8.2 Geographical and Contextual Bias in Research

The current body of research on digital entrepreneurship in innovation systems for sustainable transitions exhibits a significant geographical and contextual bias, with an overwhelming focus on developed economies and Western-centric frameworks. This imbalance limits the applicability of findings and recommendations in low-income and developing regions, where unique socio-economic, cultural, and institutional contexts shape the dynamics of digital entrepreneurship. As highlighted in several studies, the existing literature often overlooks the specific challenges and opportunities present in the Global South, where digital technologies are not only tools for innovation but also instruments of inclusion, empowerment, and sustainable development [61]. This gap is particularly acute in rural and underdeveloped areas, where empirical studies on digital entrepreneurship remain scarce and underrepresented [61]. 

The over-reliance on Western-centric models, which are often derived from highly developed digital ecosystems, fails to account for the diverse and often non-linear pathways of digital development in low-income regions. These models tend to assume a uniform trajectory of technological adoption, neglecting the complex interplay between local knowledge systems, traditional practices, and emerging digital platforms [62]. Such an approach not only risks misrepresentation of the digital entrepreneurship landscape but also undermines the potential for context-specific innovations that could better address local sustainability challenges.

Moreover, the lack of region-specific research hinders the development of effective policies and strategies that are attuned to the particularities of different socio-economic environments. For example, in many developing economies, digital entrepreneurship is deeply embedded in informal sectors and community-based initiatives, which are often excluded from mainstream academic discourse [61]. This exclusion results in a fragmented understanding of how digital technologies can be harnessed to foster sustainable transitions in contexts characterized by limited infrastructure, resource constraints, and cultural diversity.

To address these issues, future research should prioritize localized studies that explore the unique socio-economic and cultural contexts of digital entrepreneurship in developing regions. This includes examining the role of local knowledge, institutional frameworks, and community engagement in shaping digital innovation [63]. Furthermore, there is a need to develop region-specific frameworks that incorporate the insights of local stakeholders and reflect the complexities of digital ecosystems in low-income settings. By shifting the focus from a one-size-fits-all approach to a more nuanced, context-sensitive analysis, researchers can contribute to a more equitable and inclusive understanding of digital entrepreneurship in innovation systems for sustainable transitions. Such an approach not only enhances the relevance of academic findings but also supports the design of policies and interventions that are better aligned with the needs of diverse communities.

### 8.3 Sustainability Assessment Frameworks

The assessment of sustainability in digital entrepreneurial ventures remains underdeveloped, with significant gaps in comprehensive frameworks that can effectively evaluate both environmental and social impacts. Current methodologies often lack the necessary granularity to capture the multifaceted nature of sustainability, particularly in the context of rapidly evolving digital technologies and their integration into innovation systems. This subsection addresses these gaps, emphasizing the urgent need for robust, dynamic, and context-sensitive assessment tools that can support the sustainable development of digital entrepreneurship.

Existing approaches to sustainability assessment vary widely, ranging from environmental impact assessments (EIAs) to social return on investment (SROI) frameworks. However, these methods often operate in isolation, failing to account for the interconnectedness of environmental, social, and economic dimensions of sustainability. For instance, while some studies [1] have focused on the environmental implications of digital technologies, others [1] have emphasized the social dimensions of digital innovation. This fragmentation highlights the need for integrated frameworks that can holistically evaluate the sustainability performance of digital ventures.

One promising approach is the development of sustainability metrics that can be embedded within digital business models. Such metrics should capture not only direct environmental impacts, such as energy consumption and carbon footprints, but also indirect effects, including changes in consumer behavior and societal well-being. Research [1] has shown that integrating sustainability metrics into business models can enhance transparency and accountability, thereby fostering trust among stakeholders. However, the lack of standardized metrics remains a significant barrier to widespread adoption [1].

Another critical area is the assessment of digital technologies' long-term socio-ecological impacts. While some studies [1] have explored the potential of digital tools to reduce environmental footprints, there is a need for more longitudinal studies that track the cumulative effects of digitalization over time. Additionally, the unintended consequences of digital technologies, such as increased e-waste and energy consumption, require more attention [5].

Future research should focus on developing adaptive and scalable assessment frameworks that can evolve with the digital landscape. This includes leveraging advanced analytical techniques, such as machine learning and data analytics, to enhance the accuracy and relevance of sustainability assessments [2]. Furthermore, there is a need for interdisciplinary collaboration to address the complex challenges posed by digital entrepreneurship in the context of sustainable transitions [1].

In conclusion, the development of comprehensive sustainability assessment frameworks for digital entrepreneurial ventures is essential to ensure that innovation aligns with sustainability goals. By addressing current gaps and leveraging emerging methodologies, researchers and practitioners can create more resilient and socially responsible digital ecosystems.

### 8.4 Long-term Socio-Ecological Impacts of Digital Technologies

The long-term socio-ecological impacts of digital technologies within innovation systems remain underexplored, despite their profound implications for sustainability transitions. While much research focuses on immediate benefits, such as efficiency gains or reduced carbon footprints, the systemic, intergenerational, and often unintended consequences of digitalization are frequently overlooked. This subsection highlights the urgent need for a more comprehensive and critical examination of these long-term effects, calling for research that extends beyond short-term gains and delves into the broader socio-ecological transformations brought about by digital technologies.

Digital technologies, while enabling innovation, also introduce complex feedback loops that influence social equity, environmental sustainability, and institutional dynamics. For instance, the proliferation of algorithmic systems and automated decision-making tools raises questions about their long-term societal implications, particularly in terms of reinforcing structural inequalities and altering human-machine relationships [25]. Similarly, the energy-intensive nature of data centers and the environmental costs of e-waste underscore the need for a more holistic evaluation of digital technologies beyond their immediate functional advantages [19]. These challenges call for a socio-technical lens that integrates ecological, social, and technological dimensions in assessing the long-term sustainability of digital systems.

Current research on digital entrepreneurship often lacks a systemic perspective, focusing on isolated technological outcomes rather than the broader socio-ecological networks in which they are embedded. The multi-level perspective on sustainability transitions, for example, emphasizes the interplay between niche innovations, regime structures, and landscape dynamics [64], yet few studies investigate how digital technologies interact with these levels over time. Moreover, the concept of digital sustainability, as proposed in the literature, remains underdeveloped, with limited frameworks for evaluating the long-term environmental and social impacts of digital entrepreneurial initiatives [65].

Emerging research has begun to address these gaps by adopting a more integrative approach. For instance, studies on the socio-technical interplay of Industry 4.0 have highlighted the need to understand how automation and digitalization affect not only productivity but also worker agency, labor conditions, and social structures [66]. Similarly, the concept of Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) has been proposed as a framework for analyzing the complex interactions between digital, social, and physical components in sustainable systems [67]. These approaches suggest that future research should prioritize the development of dynamic, adaptive, and inclusive frameworks capable of capturing the evolving nature of digital systems and their socio-ecological effects.

In conclusion, the long-term socio-ecological impacts of digital technologies demand greater scholarly attention. Future research should move beyond conventional metrics of success and adopt a more systemic, interdisciplinary, and forward-looking approach to understand the broader implications of digital innovation. By doing so, researchers can contribute to the development of more equitable, resilient, and sustainable digital ecosystems.

### 8.5 Non-Technical Dimensions of Digital Entrepreneurship

The non-technical dimensions of digital entrepreneurship remain significantly underexplored in the current literature, despite their critical role in shaping the trajectory and impact of digital innovations. While much of the existing research focuses on technological capabilities, business models, and scalability, the human, social, and institutional aspects of digital entrepreneurship are often sidelined. This gap is particularly evident in the fields of ethics, culture, and policy, which are essential to understanding the broader implications of digital solutions in sustainable transitions. For instance, the ethical implications of artificial intelligence and data governance, as highlighted in [68], underscore the need for frameworks that go beyond technical considerations to address societal values and human-centric outcomes. Similarly, [38] emphasizes that sustainability requirements cannot be fully understood without considering the socio-institutional and cultural contexts in which digital solutions are deployed.  

Cultural dimensions also play a pivotal role in shaping how digital entrepreneurship is perceived, adopted, and sustained. [56] argues that the digital divide is not merely a technical or economic issue but is deeply intertwined with social and cultural inequities. In low-income and developing regions, digital entrepreneurship often faces barriers rooted in traditional practices, lack of digital literacy, and resistance to change, as noted in [69]. These cultural and social factors must be integrated into research and policy frameworks to ensure that digital solutions are not only technically sound but also socially inclusive and culturally appropriate.  

Policy and regulatory environments further shape the non-technical landscape of digital entrepreneurship. [45] highlights the ambivalent role of digital technologies, where while they can contribute to sustainability, their environmental costs—such as energy consumption and e-waste—require regulatory intervention. However, [51] stresses that policy alone is insufficient; it must be complemented by ethical and design-oriented approaches to ensure that digital innovation aligns with sustainability goals.  

To address these gaps, future research should prioritize interdisciplinary approaches that bridge technical and non-technical dimensions. This includes developing methodologies that incorporate stakeholder perspectives, cultural contexts, and ethical frameworks into digital entrepreneurship studies. By doing so, researchers can contribute to a more holistic understanding of how digital innovation interacts with societal values, governance structures, and cultural norms in the pursuit of sustainable transitions.

### 8.6 Comparative and Longitudinal Research Needs

The need for comparative and longitudinal studies in digital entrepreneurship for sustainable transitions is increasingly evident as the field grapples with the dynamic and context-dependent nature of innovation. While existing research has made significant strides in understanding the technical and strategic dimensions of digital entrepreneurial activities, there is a critical gap in systematically tracking how these activities evolve over time and differ across geographies, sectors, and institutional settings. Comparative studies can help identify patterns of success and failure, while longitudinal analyses can reveal the long-term impacts of digital strategies on sustainability outcomes. Such research is essential for developing more robust theoretical frameworks and practical recommendations that are grounded in empirical evidence [1; 2].

Comparative studies, for instance, can shed light on how digital entrepreneurship in developed versus developing economies differs in terms of resource availability, regulatory environments, and stakeholder engagement. Research on digital platforms in the Global South [1] highlights the importance of localized solutions that account for unique socio-economic and cultural contexts. Similarly, cross-sectoral comparisons—such as between the energy, agriculture, and urban development sectors—can uncover how digital tools are adapted and scaled in different institutional settings. These insights are crucial for designing policies and interventions that are both effective and equitable [2; 2].

Longitudinal research, on the other hand, enables the tracking of digital entrepreneurial trajectories from inception to long-term sustainability. By examining the evolution of digital ventures over time, researchers can better understand the factors that contribute to their resilience and adaptability in the face of changing technological, economic, and environmental conditions. For example, studies on the life cycle of AI-based systems [6; 14] have demonstrated how the energy and carbon footprints of digital technologies can shift over time, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring and optimization. This type of research is particularly important in the context of sustainable transitions, where the long-term implications of digital innovation must be carefully considered [2; 5].

Furthermore, the integration of comparative and longitudinal approaches can provide a more holistic view of digital entrepreneurship by bridging the gap between micro-level innovation and macro-level systemic change. By analyzing how digital strategies interact with broader sustainability goals, researchers can identify opportunities for scaling and replicating successful models while mitigating potential negative consequences. Such efforts are vital for advancing the field and ensuring that digital entrepreneurship contributes meaningfully to the transition toward a more sustainable future [1; 9].
