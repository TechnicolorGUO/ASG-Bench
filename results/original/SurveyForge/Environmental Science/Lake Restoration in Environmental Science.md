# A Comprehensive Survey on Lake Restoration in Environmental Science

## 1 Introduction

The restoration of lakes is a critical component of environmental science, essential for maintaining the ecological balance, supporting biodiversity, and addressing the degradation of freshwater ecosystems. Lakes, as dynamic and complex ecosystems, serve as vital resources for both human and ecological well-being, yet they face increasing threats from climate change, pollution, and anthropogenic activities. This subsection provides an overview of the importance of lake restoration, examining its role in ecological, economic, and social contexts, while also addressing the historical evolution of restoration practices and the current challenges that must be overcome.

Lake restoration encompasses a wide array of interventions aimed at reversing the damage caused by human activities and natural stressors. These interventions range from physical and chemical treatments to biological and technological approaches, each with its own set of advantages and limitations [1]. The ecological significance of healthy lakes cannot be overstated; they provide critical habitats for a wide range of species, regulate water quality, and support essential ecosystem services such as water filtration and carbon sequestration [2]. Economically, lakes contribute to tourism, fisheries, and recreation, while socially, they are integral to cultural and spiritual practices in many communities [3].

Historically, lake restoration efforts have evolved in response to the growing awareness of environmental degradation and the need for sustainable management practices [4]. Early approaches were often reactive, focusing on mitigating immediate impacts rather than addressing root causes. However, contemporary restoration strategies emphasize proactive, holistic, and science-based solutions that integrate ecological principles with technological advancements. This shift is driven by the recognition that lakes are not isolated systems but are deeply interconnected with their surrounding watersheds and broader environmental contexts [5].

Despite these advancements, significant challenges remain. Climate change, for instance, introduces new variables that complicate traditional restoration approaches, requiring adaptive and resilient strategies [6]. Anthropogenic pressures such as pollution and land-use changes further exacerbate these challenges, necessitating integrated and collaborative efforts among scientists, policymakers, and local communities [7]. The development of robust monitoring and assessment frameworks is also critical to ensuring the long-term success of restoration initiatives [8].

In conclusion, the importance of lake restoration in environmental science is underscored by its multifaceted role in sustaining ecological health, economic stability, and social well-being. As the field continues to evolve, there is a pressing need for innovative, interdisciplinary approaches that address the complex and interconnected challenges facing freshwater ecosystems. Future research should focus on improving the scalability, efficiency, and sustainability of restoration practices, while also emphasizing the importance of community engagement and policy integration [9; 7].

## 2 Ecological and Hydrological Principles of Lake Restoration

### 2.1 Understanding Natural Lake Ecosystem Functioning

Understanding natural lake ecosystem functioning is foundational to the principles of lake restoration, as it provides the ecological and hydrological context necessary for effective intervention. Lakes are dynamic systems where physical, chemical, and biological processes interact to maintain their health and stability. These interactions are governed by fundamental ecological and hydrological principles, which must be understood to guide restoration efforts. Nutrient cycling, water quality dynamics, and the interplay between biotic and abiotic factors are central to the natural functioning of lake ecosystems and serve as key indicators of their condition [10].

Nutrient cycling is a critical process that regulates primary productivity and trophic interactions within lakes. The availability of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus determines the growth of phytoplankton, which forms the base of the aquatic food web. This process is influenced by external inputs, such as agricultural runoff, and internal processes like sediment resuspension and microbial activity [10]. The balance of these nutrients is essential for maintaining the ecological equilibrium of a lake, and disruptions to this balance, often due to eutrophication, can lead to degraded water quality and biodiversity loss. Advanced models, such as those incorporating process-based algorithms and data assimilation, have been developed to better predict and manage nutrient dynamics in lake systems [10].

Water quality dynamics encompass a range of physical and chemical properties, including dissolved oxygen, pH, and temperature regimes. These factors influence the survival and distribution of aquatic organisms and are affected by both natural and anthropogenic stressors. For instance, dissolved oxygen levels are critical for aquatic life and are influenced by photosynthesis, respiration, and water temperature [10]. The application of remote sensing and in-situ monitoring technologies has improved the ability to track these parameters in real time, facilitating more precise and adaptive restoration strategies [10].

Biotic-abiotic interactions regulate ecosystem balance and resilience by mediating nutrient availability, controlling species interactions, and influencing habitat structure. These interactions are complex and often nonlinear, requiring integrative approaches to model and understand [11]. The influence of seasonal variability on biogeochemical processes further complicates ecosystem functioning, as changes in temperature, light, and hydrology affect primary production, decomposition, and nutrient cycling [12].

Emerging trends in lake restoration emphasize the integration of ecological modeling, remote sensing, and data-driven approaches to better understand and manage natural lake ecosystems. Techniques such as physics-guided neural networks and deep learning have shown promise in improving the accuracy of lake temperature and water quality predictions [10]. These advancements highlight the potential of interdisciplinary research to address the challenges of lake restoration in an era of climate change and increasing anthropogenic pressures. As such, a deeper understanding of natural lake ecosystem functioning remains essential for the development of sustainable and resilient restoration strategies.

### 2.2 Hydrological Processes and Their Influence on Lake Conditions

Hydrological processes play a fundamental role in shaping lake conditions, influencing water quality, biogeochemical cycles, and ecosystem dynamics. In the context of lake restoration, understanding these processes is essential for designing effective interventions that align with natural hydrological regimes. Key hydrological factors include inflow and outflow dynamics, water residence time, and the interactions between surface and groundwater, which collectively determine the physical and chemical characteristics of lake systems. Inflow and outflow dynamics govern the exchange of water between the lake and its surrounding watershed, with variations in discharge rates affecting nutrient and contaminant loading, sediment transport, and overall lake connectivity. For instance, high inflow rates can flush nutrients into the lake, promoting algal growth and potentially leading to eutrophication, while low outflow rates can increase water residence time, allowing for greater nutrient retention and possible hypoxia [10]. These processes are further complicated by the heterogeneity of watershed characteristics, such as land cover, topography, and hydrological connectivity, which modulate the timing and magnitude of water inputs to the lake [10].  

Water residence time, defined as the average duration that water remains in a lake, is a critical parameter that influences nutrient cycling, pollutant accumulation, and the stability of aquatic ecosystems. Longer residence times can enhance the retention of nutrients and sediments, leading to increased biological productivity but also raising the risk of water quality degradation. Conversely, shorter residence times may dilute pollutants but may also limit the development of stable aquatic communities. Modeling water residence time requires integrating hydrological data with lake morphometry and flow dynamics, often using tracer experiments or numerical simulations [10]. Surface and groundwater interactions further complicate lake hydrology, as groundwater inputs can provide a steady source of water and nutrients, while surface runoff introduces variable and often episodic inputs. The interplay between these systems is particularly relevant in restoration efforts, where manipulating hydrological connectivity can help restore natural flow regimes and improve water quality [10].  

Emerging approaches in hydrological modeling, such as those employing machine learning and remote sensing, offer new opportunities to enhance our understanding of these processes. For example, deep learning techniques can improve the accuracy of water quality predictions by capturing complex relationships between hydrological variables and lake responses [10]. Similarly, remote sensing allows for continuous monitoring of lake levels, inflow, and outflow, facilitating the development of data-driven restoration strategies. However, these methods also face challenges, including data scarcity, model uncertainty, and the need for calibration against in-situ measurements. As the field of lake restoration evolves, integrating hydrological process understanding with advanced analytical tools will be critical for achieving sustainable and resilient lake ecosystems.

### 2.3 Anthropogenic Impacts on Lake Health and Restoration Challenges

Anthropogenic activities have profoundly altered the ecological and hydrological integrity of lake systems, posing significant challenges to their restoration. These stressors, including pollution, sedimentation, and land-use changes, disrupt the delicate balance of nutrient cycles, water quality dynamics, and biodiversity, ultimately undermining the resilience of lake ecosystems. The cumulative impacts of these anthropogenic pressures complicate restoration efforts, necessitating a nuanced understanding of their interplay and cascading effects.

Pollution, in its various forms, remains a primary driver of lake degradation. Nutrient loading, particularly from agricultural runoff and urban wastewater, leads to eutrophication, which triggers algal blooms and oxygen depletion, severely degrading water quality [13]. Heavy metals and microplastics further exacerbate these issues, introducing toxicological risks to aquatic organisms and disrupting food web dynamics [10]. These pollutants not only impair the physical and chemical properties of lakes but also reduce their capacity to support diverse biological communities. The challenge lies in mitigating these pollutants effectively while accounting for their complex interactions and long-term persistence in the environment.

Sedimentation, another critical anthropogenic stressor, arises from soil erosion and land-use changes, such as deforestation and urbanization. Excessive sediment inputs reduce water clarity, smother benthic habitats, and alter nutrient dynamics, thereby impairing the ecological functions of lakes [14]. The deposition of fine sediments can also lead to the loss of critical habitats for aquatic species, further diminishing biodiversity. Sedimentation is particularly problematic in shallow lakes, where it can significantly alter the physical structure of the ecosystem and hinder restoration efforts by requiring extensive dredging and habitat rehabilitation.

Land-use changes, including urbanization and agricultural expansion, fundamentally alter the hydrological connectivity and water quality of lake catchments. These changes often result in increased surface runoff, reduced infiltration, and altered flow regimes, which can lead to more frequent and severe flooding events [12]. Moreover, the fragmentation of natural landscapes reduces the ability of lakes to buffer against environmental stressors, making them more vulnerable to pollution and climate variability. The restoration of such impacted lakes requires not only addressing the direct sources of contamination but also restoring the broader watershed processes that regulate hydrological and ecological functions.

The interplay of these anthropogenic stressors complicates restoration efforts, as they often interact in non-linear and context-dependent ways. For instance, nutrient pollution can exacerbate the effects of sedimentation, leading to a feedback loop that further degrades lake health [12]. Similarly, land-use changes can alter the hydrological regime, influencing the effectiveness of pollution control measures. Addressing these challenges requires integrated approaches that consider the multiple stressors and their synergistic effects.

Recent advancements in modeling and monitoring technologies, such as remote sensing and machine learning, offer promising tools for assessing and mitigating anthropogenic impacts on lakes [10; 10]. These technologies enable the identification of pollution sources, the prediction of sediment transport, and the evaluation of restoration outcomes with greater precision and efficiency. However, the successful implementation of these tools depends on the availability of high-quality data and the development of robust analytical frameworks that can integrate diverse datasets.

In conclusion, the anthropogenic impacts on lake health present complex and multifaceted challenges that require comprehensive and adaptive restoration strategies. The integration of ecological, hydrological, and technological approaches is essential to address these challenges effectively. Future research should focus on developing more resilient and scalable solutions that can accommodate the dynamic and interconnected nature of anthropogenic stressors in lake systems.

### 2.4 Biodiversity and Trophic Interactions in Lake Resilience

Biodiversity and trophic interactions are fundamental to the resilience and functional integrity of lake ecosystems, playing a crucial role in maintaining ecological stability and facilitating recovery from disturbances. The complexity of species interactions within food webs ensures that lakes can withstand and adapt to environmental stressors, such as pollution, climate change, and invasive species. This subsection explores how species diversity, trophic dynamics, and ecological interactions contribute to lake resilience, emphasizing their importance in lake restoration efforts. 

Species diversity enhances ecosystem resilience by promoting functional redundancy, where multiple species can perform similar roles, ensuring that critical ecological functions are maintained even if some species are lost or diminished. For instance, a diverse assemblage of phytoplankton species can buffer against fluctuations in nutrient availability and light conditions, maintaining primary productivity and supporting higher trophic levels. This concept is supported by studies that demonstrate the stabilizing effect of biodiversity on ecosystem processes, such as nutrient cycling and energy transfer [10]. Additionally, the presence of multiple species can reduce the risk of trophic cascades, where the loss of a single species disrupts the entire food web [11].

Trophic interactions, particularly between producers, consumers, and decomposers, regulate energy flow and nutrient cycling within lake ecosystems. These interactions are influenced by both abiotic and biotic factors, and their structure determines the overall stability of the system. For example, the presence of top predators can control herbivore populations, preventing overgrazing of aquatic vegetation and maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. This is exemplified in studies that highlight the role of predatory fish in regulating algal blooms and maintaining water clarity [10]. Furthermore, the complexity of trophic interactions can enhance the system's ability to recover from disturbances by promoting alternative pathways for energy and nutrient flow [12].

Keystone species, which have disproportionately large effects on their environment relative to their abundance, are particularly important in maintaining ecosystem stability. Their presence can shape community structure and influence the dynamics of trophic interactions. For example, certain species of macroinvertebrates play a critical role in nutrient recycling and sediment stabilization, while aquatic plants can provide habitat and improve water quality through nutrient uptake. The loss or invasion of such species can have far-reaching consequences, disrupting food webs and reducing the overall resilience of the ecosystem [10]. Therefore, conservation and restoration efforts should prioritize the protection and reestablishment of keystone species to enhance ecological resilience.

The integration of biodiversity and trophic interactions into lake restoration strategies is essential for achieving long-term ecological stability. Emerging approaches, such as the use of biogeochemical models and remote sensing, offer new tools to assess and monitor the impacts of biodiversity on lake health [10]. Additionally, the application of machine learning techniques, as demonstrated in studies on plankton classification and water quality prediction, highlights the potential for data-driven approaches to enhance our understanding of trophic dynamics [14]. These innovations underscore the need for interdisciplinary research to develop more effective and adaptive lake restoration strategies that account for the complex interplay of biodiversity and trophic interactions.

## 3 Key Challenges in Lake Restoration

### 3.1 Pollution Sources and Their Ecological Impacts

Pollution remains one of the most significant challenges in lake restoration, with multiple sources contributing to ecological degradation. Agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, and urban waste are primary contributors, each introducing distinct pollutants that alter water quality and disrupt aquatic ecosystems [4]. Agricultural activities, particularly the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, lead to nutrient loading, primarily nitrogen and phosphorus, which drive eutrophication [15]. This process results in algal blooms, oxygen depletion, and the eventual loss of biodiversity. Nutrient loading is further exacerbated by soil erosion, which transports sediments and associated pollutants into lakes, reducing water clarity and smothering benthic habitats [3].  

Industrial discharges, on the other hand, introduce heavy metals such as mercury, lead, and cadmium, which accumulate in sediments and bioaccumulate in the food web, posing severe toxicological risks to aquatic organisms and humans [16]. These contaminants often persist in the environment for extended periods, leading to chronic toxicity and long-term ecological imbalance. Urban waste, including untreated sewage and stormwater runoff, introduces pathogens, organic matter, and microplastics into lake systems. Microplastics, in particular, have emerged as a significant concern due to their persistence, ability to adsorb pollutants, and potential to disrupt endocrine systems in aquatic organisms [17].  

The ecological impacts of these pollutants are multifaceted, affecting water quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem functions. Nutrient loading and eutrophication lead to hypoxia and anoxia, resulting in fish kills and shifts in community composition [18]. Heavy metal contamination disrupts physiological processes in aquatic organisms, impairing reproduction, growth, and survival. Microplastics, by contrast, introduce physical and chemical stressors, affecting feeding behavior, reproductive success, and overall fitness of aquatic species [19].  

The interplay between these pollution sources further complicates lake restoration, as combined stressors can synergistically exacerbate ecological damage. For instance, nutrient loading and microplastic accumulation can interact to create a more hostile environment for aquatic life, while industrial pollutants may interact with urban contaminants to increase bioavailability and toxicity [20]. Addressing these challenges requires integrated and adaptive management strategies that consider the dynamic nature of pollution sources and their ecological consequences. Future research should focus on developing predictive models that incorporate multiple pollutant types and their interactions, as well as exploring innovative remediation techniques that target emerging contaminants such as microplastics and pharmaceuticals [5]. By combining advanced monitoring technologies with interdisciplinary approaches, lake restoration efforts can be more effectively tailored to mitigate the complex and evolving threats posed by pollution.

### 3.2 Eutrophication Dynamics and Water Quality Degradation

Eutrophication is a complex and pervasive challenge in lake restoration, driven by excessive nutrient loading, primarily nitrogen and phosphorus, which disrupts the natural balance of aquatic ecosystems. This process initiates a cascade of ecological and hydrological changes, significantly degrading water quality and undermining the resilience of lake systems. Nutrient cycling, central to eutrophication dynamics, involves the transformation and transport of nitrogen and phosphorus through various biogeochemical pathways, often exacerbated by anthropogenic inputs such as agricultural runoff, wastewater discharges, and urban expansion [21]. The accumulation of these nutrients stimulates the rapid growth of algae, leading to algal blooms that can dominate the water column and alter light penetration, ultimately affecting primary productivity and trophic interactions [10]. The resultant shifts in phytoplankton composition can trigger further changes in the food web, impacting zooplankton, fish, and higher trophic levels, thereby reducing biodiversity and ecosystem stability [21].

One of the most severe consequences of eutrophication is the depletion of dissolved oxygen in deeper water layers, a phenomenon known as hypoxia or anoxia. This occurs as the organic matter from dead algae and other organisms undergoes microbial decomposition, consuming oxygen in the process. The resulting oxygen-deficient conditions can lead to fish kills, habitat degradation, and the release of stored nutrients from sediments, further exacerbating eutrophication [10]. The feedback loop between nutrient loading, algal blooms, and oxygen depletion is particularly concerning in stratified lakes, where the mixing of water layers is limited, preventing the replenishment of oxygen in the hypolimnion. Recent studies have highlighted the role of climate change in amplifying these dynamics, as rising temperatures increase the stratification of lakes and enhance the availability of nutrients for algal growth [10].

The implications of eutrophication extend beyond ecological degradation, affecting human health and water use. Algal blooms can produce harmful toxins, such as microcystins, which pose significant risks to drinking water supplies and recreational activities. Additionally, the aesthetic and economic value of lakes can be severely compromised, impacting tourism and property values [10]. To address these challenges, a range of mitigation strategies has been developed, including nutrient management practices, wetland restoration, and the use of advanced monitoring technologies. However, the effectiveness of these interventions often depends on the scale and complexity of the nutrient sources, as well as the hydrodynamic and biogeochemical characteristics of the lake system [10].

Emerging research in machine learning and remote sensing has provided new tools for understanding and managing eutrophication, enabling real-time monitoring of nutrient dynamics and algal blooms [10]. These approaches offer the potential to improve predictive accuracy and support adaptive management strategies. Nonetheless, the integration of these technologies into lake restoration practices remains a significant challenge, requiring interdisciplinary collaboration and sustained investment in data collection and analysis. As the global demand for clean water continues to grow, addressing the complex dynamics of eutrophication will remain a critical priority in lake restoration efforts.

### 3.3 Invasive Species and Biodiversity Threats

Invasive species pose a significant threat to lake ecosystems, disrupting native biodiversity, altering trophic interactions, and reducing the resilience of aquatic communities. These non-native organisms, often introduced through human activities such as ballast water discharge, aquaculture, or recreational boating, can rapidly colonize new environments due to the absence of natural predators or competitors. Once established, invasive species can outcompete native species for resources, modify habitat structures, and even lead to local extinctions, thereby undermining the ecological integrity of lake systems [10]. For instance, the introduction of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in North American lakes has dramatically altered nutrient cycling and water clarity, with cascading effects on the entire food web [10]. Such ecological disruptions can reduce the effectiveness of traditional restoration efforts, as invasive species often require targeted and sustained management strategies.

The ecological impacts of invasive species are multifaceted, affecting both pelagic and benthic communities, as well as the overall functioning of aquatic ecosystems. Invasive fish species, such as the northern pike (Esox lucius) and the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), have been shown to alter predator-prey dynamics, leading to declines in native fish populations and shifts in community structure [10]. Additionally, invasive aquatic plants, like water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), can form dense mats that block sunlight, reduce oxygen levels, and hinder water circulation, further degrading lake health [10]. These changes not only affect biodiversity but also compromise the ecosystem services provided by lakes, such as water purification, fishery productivity, and recreational value.

Managing invasive species in lake ecosystems remains a complex challenge, requiring a combination of early detection, rapid response, and long-term monitoring. Traditional control methods, including mechanical removal, chemical treatments, and biological control, often face limitations due to the high cost, logistical difficulties, and potential ecological side effects [10]. Furthermore, the interconnected nature of lake systems complicates management efforts, as invasive species can spread through hydrological connectivity and human-mediated vectors. Emerging approaches, such as the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) for early detection and the application of machine learning algorithms to predict spread patterns, offer promising avenues for more effective and sustainable management [11]. However, these technologies are still in their infancy and require further validation and integration into existing management frameworks. Addressing the challenge of invasive species will require interdisciplinary collaboration, adaptive management strategies, and a deeper understanding of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics that govern their spread and impact.

### 3.4 Climate Change and Hydrological Variability

Climate change is increasingly recognized as a pivotal challenge in lake restoration, fundamentally altering hydrological regimes, temperature dynamics, and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. These changes not only disrupt the ecological balance of lake systems but also challenge the efficacy of traditional restoration strategies, necessitating a reevaluation of existing approaches and the development of adaptive management frameworks. The impacts of climate change on lakes are multifaceted, involving shifts in precipitation patterns, increased water temperatures, and altered hydrological connectivity, all of which have profound implications for water quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem resilience [10]. 

Shifts in precipitation patterns, for instance, can lead to either prolonged droughts or increased runoff, both of which significantly affect lake levels and nutrient dynamics. Drought conditions may reduce water availability, leading to higher concentrations of pollutants and decreased dilution capacity, while excessive runoff can result in sedimentation and nutrient loading, exacerbating eutrophication [10]. These changes are not uniform across regions, and their effects are further compounded by local variations in land use and watershed characteristics, making it imperative to develop region-specific adaptation strategies [10]. 

Rising water temperatures, another critical consequence of climate change, alter the thermal structure of lakes, influencing stratification patterns and oxygen availability. Warmer surface waters can lead to increased hypoxia in deeper zones, negatively impacting aquatic life and reducing the overall productivity of the ecosystem. This temperature-driven shift is particularly concerning for cold-water species, which are often unable to adapt to rapid environmental changes [11]. Moreover, warmer conditions can accelerate the growth of harmful algal blooms, further degrading water quality and posing risks to human health [13].

Extreme weather events, including intense storms and prolonged heatwaves, add another layer of complexity to lake management. These events can cause sudden changes in water levels, leading to habitat disruption and increased sedimentation. The unpredictability of such events makes it difficult to implement traditional restoration measures, as they often fail to account for the dynamic and non-linear responses of lake systems to climatic stressors [10]. 

In response to these challenges, there is a growing need for adaptive and integrative approaches to lake restoration. Advances in predictive modeling and remote sensing technologies offer promising avenues for monitoring and managing the impacts of climate change on lake ecosystems [12]. These tools can provide real-time data on hydrological and thermal changes, enabling more responsive and targeted restoration efforts. Furthermore, the integration of climate change projections into restoration planning is essential to ensure that interventions remain effective under future environmental conditions [12]. 

In conclusion, the interplay between climate change and hydrological variability presents significant challenges for lake restoration. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates scientific research, technological innovation, and adaptive management practices. By leveraging emerging technologies and fostering collaboration across sectors, it is possible to develop more resilient and sustainable strategies for lake restoration in the face of a changing climate.

### 3.5 Integrated and Adaptive Management Challenges

The management of lake restoration in the face of multiple interacting stressors—such as pollution, climate change, and invasive species—presents a formidable challenge that necessitates integrated, adaptive, and multi-disciplinary approaches. Traditional restoration strategies often fail to account for the complex and dynamic interactions among these stressors, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. Integrated management frameworks aim to address this by combining ecological, socio-economic, and technological dimensions of lake restoration, enabling more holistic and resilient strategies [10]. These approaches require the coordination of diverse stakeholders, including scientists, policymakers, and local communities, to ensure that restoration efforts align with broader environmental and societal goals.

Adaptive management, which emphasizes continuous learning and iterative improvements, has emerged as a critical component of modern lake restoration practices. This approach allows for the incorporation of new data, feedback, and evolving environmental conditions into restoration planning, enabling more responsive and flexible strategies. For instance, the use of real-time monitoring systems and predictive modeling supports the dynamic adjustment of management interventions, enhancing the effectiveness of restoration efforts [10]. However, the implementation of adaptive management is often constrained by limited data availability, uncertainty in ecological responses, and the complexity of governance structures [10]. These challenges underscore the need for robust frameworks that can integrate diverse data sources and support decision-making under uncertainty.

The integration of ecological network theory and computational methods has also gained traction in addressing the complexity of lake restoration. By modeling ecological interactions and network structures, researchers can identify key drivers of ecosystem resilience and vulnerability, informing more targeted and effective restoration strategies [10]. For example, the application of graph theory and network analysis enables the identification of keystone species and critical habitats, which can be prioritized in restoration planning [10]. Such approaches not only enhance our understanding of ecological dynamics but also support the development of more resilient and adaptive management strategies.

Emerging technologies, including machine learning and remote sensing, offer promising tools for improving the precision and scalability of lake restoration efforts. These technologies can enhance the monitoring of ecological changes, predict the impacts of stressors, and optimize the allocation of restoration resources [11]. However, the successful integration of these technologies requires overcoming challenges related to data quality, model interpretability, and the development of user-friendly tools for practitioners [12]. Furthermore, the ethical and social implications of relying on algorithmic decision-making in ecological management must be carefully considered [10].

In conclusion, the challenges of integrated and adaptive lake restoration necessitate a shift from siloed, static approaches to more collaborative, dynamic, and data-driven strategies. The integration of ecological, social, and technological dimensions, supported by advances in computational methods and emerging technologies, offers a promising path forward. Future research should focus on the development of more robust and scalable frameworks that can accommodate the uncertainties and complexities of lake ecosystems, ensuring the long-term success of restoration efforts [12].

## 4 Restoration Techniques and Technologies

### 4.1 Physical and Mechanical Restoration Methods

Traditional physical and mechanical restoration methods play a crucial role in rehabilitating degraded lake ecosystems by directly modifying the physical and structural characteristics of the water body. These interventions aim to improve water quality, enhance habitat conditions, and restore ecological functions through processes such as dredging, aeration, and habitat reconstruction. By altering the physical environment, these methods can address issues such as sediment accumulation, oxygen depletion, and habitat loss, which are common in eutrophic or polluted lakes.

Dredging, for example, involves the removal of contaminated or excess sediments from the lakebed to improve water clarity and reduce nutrient loading. This process can significantly decrease internal phosphorus loading, which is a major driver of algal blooms and eutrophication [10]. However, dredging is often costly, disruptive to benthic habitats, and can lead to resuspension of pollutants if not carefully managed. The effectiveness of dredging depends on factors such as sediment composition, lake depth, and the presence of toxic contaminants, as highlighted in studies that emphasize the need for site-specific assessments [10].

Aeration and oxygenation techniques are another key category of mechanical interventions, aimed at increasing dissolved oxygen levels in the water column. This is particularly important in stratified lakes where hypoxic conditions in deeper layers can lead to fish kills and the release of nutrients from sediments. Methods such as diffused aeration, surface aerators, and constructed wetlands can enhance oxygenation and promote the decomposition of organic matter [10]. While these methods are generally less invasive than dredging, they may require continuous energy input and can be less effective in large or deep lakes.

Habitat reconstruction involves the restoration or creation of natural habitats such as wetlands, vegetation buffers, and submerged structures to support biodiversity and improve ecological resilience. This approach often includes the planting of native vegetation, the construction of artificial reefs, and the reestablishment of natural hydrological flows [10]. These efforts not only enhance habitat quality but also contribute to water filtration and sediment stabilization. However, the success of habitat reconstruction depends on long-term maintenance and the ability to integrate with existing ecological processes.

Structural modifications, such as the installation of barriers, channels, and weirs, can also be used to control water flow, sediment deposition, and nutrient cycling. These interventions can help to mitigate erosion, improve water retention, and redirect flows to areas in need of restoration [10]. While effective in certain contexts, such modifications must be carefully designed to avoid unintended ecological consequences.

Emerging trends in physical and mechanical restoration include the integration of advanced monitoring technologies to optimize intervention strategies and assess their ecological impacts. For instance, the use of remote sensing and autonomous systems is becoming increasingly common to track changes in water quality and habitat conditions over time [11]. These innovations highlight the growing importance of adaptive management and data-driven decision-making in lake restoration efforts.

In conclusion, physical and mechanical restoration methods remain essential tools in the rehabilitation of degraded lake ecosystems. While each technique has its strengths and limitations, their combined application can significantly enhance the effectiveness of restoration initiatives. Future research should focus on improving the efficiency, sustainability, and ecological compatibility of these methods, as well as on developing integrated approaches that combine physical, chemical, and biological interventions for holistic lake management.

### 4.2 Chemical and Biogeochemical Interventions

Chemical and biogeochemical interventions are essential components of lake restoration strategies, offering targeted solutions to address specific pollutants and enhance water quality. These techniques often involve the application of chemical agents or the manipulation of biogeochemical processes to mitigate contamination, restore nutrient balance, and improve ecological conditions. Unlike physical interventions, which directly alter the physical structure of lakes, chemical and biogeochemical approaches focus on modifying the chemical composition and biological interactions within the water body. These methods can be particularly effective in managing nutrient loading, heavy metals, and other contaminants that are difficult to remove through physical means alone [13].

One of the primary applications of chemical interventions is nutrient management, aimed at reducing eutrophication. Nutrient control strategies include the use of phosphate-binding agents, such as aluminum sulfate or lanthanum-modified bentonite, which can precipitate phosphorus and reduce its bioavailability [10]. Liming is another technique used to neutralize acidic waters and improve pH levels, thereby enhancing the overall water quality and supporting aquatic life [10]. These chemical treatments are often combined with biological approaches, such as the introduction of macrophytes or bioremediation agents, to enhance their effectiveness and promote long-term ecological resilience.

Biogeochemical interventions, on the other hand, focus on manipulating the interactions between biological and geochemical processes to restore ecosystem functions. For example, biogeochemical modeling has emerged as a powerful tool to simulate and predict the behavior of pollutants and nutrients within lake systems. These models can guide the design of targeted chemical interventions by identifying critical pathways and processes that influence contaminant fate and transport [10]. Additionally, the application of reactive barriers or in-situ chemical oxidation techniques can be used to degrade organic pollutants and heavy metals in contaminated sediments, offering a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to traditional dredging methods [14].

The integration of advanced analytical techniques, such as machine learning and remote sensing, has further enhanced the precision and efficiency of chemical and biogeochemical interventions. These technologies enable the real-time monitoring of water quality parameters, allowing for adaptive management and the optimization of intervention strategies [10]. For instance, the use of deep learning algorithms has been shown to improve the prediction of nutrient concentrations and contaminant dynamics, facilitating more accurate and timely decision-making in lake restoration efforts [10].

Despite their potential, chemical and biogeochemical interventions are not without challenges. The long-term ecological impacts of chemical treatments, such as the potential for secondary pollution or unintended effects on non-target organisms, require careful consideration. Moreover, the effectiveness of these methods can be influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature, pH, and hydrodynamic processes, which must be accounted for in the design and implementation of restoration strategies [22].

Future research should focus on the development of more environmentally benign and sustainable chemical interventions, as well as the integration of biogeochemical approaches with emerging technologies to enhance their efficacy. By combining chemical, biogeochemical, and technological innovations, lake restoration efforts can become more precise, adaptive, and aligned with the principles of ecological sustainability.

### 4.3 Biological and Ecological Approaches

Biological and ecological approaches to lake restoration focus on enhancing natural processes and reintroducing native species to improve lake health and functionality. These methods leverage the inherent resilience of ecosystems and aim to restore ecological balance by addressing underlying disturbances and promoting biodiversity. Unlike physical and chemical interventions, which often target specific stressors, biological and ecological approaches seek to rebuild the complex interactions that sustain healthy lake ecosystems. This subsection explores key strategies, their theoretical foundations, and practical applications, emphasizing their role in long-term lake recovery and sustainability.

One of the primary strategies within this category is bioremediation, which involves the use of microorganisms, plants, and algae to degrade or absorb pollutants, thereby improving water quality and restoring ecological balance [10]. For instance, studies have demonstrated that certain bacterial strains can efficiently break down organic pollutants and heavy metals, while aquatic plants like water hyacinth and duckweed can absorb excess nutrients, reducing eutrophication risks [10]. Phytoremediation, a subset of bioremediation, has been particularly effective in mitigating nutrient loading and sediment accumulation, making it a valuable tool for lakes suffering from excessive nutrient inputs [10]. However, the success of bioremediation depends on factors such as environmental conditions, species selection, and the scale of contamination, which necessitate careful planning and monitoring.

Another critical approach is the restoration of wetlands and riparian zones, which play a vital role in filtering runoff, stabilizing shorelines, and supporting diverse aquatic and terrestrial species [10]. Wetland restoration enhances the natural filtration capacity of lakes, reducing sediment and nutrient loads and improving water clarity. Additionally, vegetated buffers along lake shores help prevent erosion, maintain habitat complexity, and provide refuge for native species. These ecological interventions are particularly effective in rural and remote areas where natural processes are less disrupted by anthropogenic activities [10]. However, their implementation can be challenging in urbanized settings due to land use constraints and the need for long-term maintenance.

Species reestablishment and trophic level management are also essential components of ecological restoration. The reintroduction of native fish, invertebrates, and aquatic plants can help restore natural food web dynamics, control algal blooms, and enhance overall ecosystem resilience [11]. For example, the introduction of predator species such as bass or pike can regulate prey populations, preventing overgrazing of aquatic vegetation and maintaining a balanced trophic structure. Similarly, the management of fish populations through selective harvesting or stocking can mitigate the impacts of invasive species and improve water quality [12]. However, the success of species reestablishment depends on the availability of suitable habitats, the absence of competing or predatory species, and the presence of sufficient genetic diversity.

Emerging trends in biological and ecological restoration include the integration of advanced monitoring technologies and data-driven decision-making. For instance, remote sensing and machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to assess the effectiveness of restoration efforts, monitor biodiversity changes, and predict ecological responses to management interventions [10]. These technologies provide valuable insights into the complex interactions within lake ecosystems, enabling more targeted and adaptive restoration strategies.

In conclusion, biological and ecological approaches offer a sustainable and holistic framework for lake restoration, emphasizing the importance of natural processes and biodiversity. While these methods face challenges related to scale, complexity, and long-term monitoring, their potential to restore ecological integrity and enhance resilience makes them a critical component of integrated lake management strategies.

### 4.4 Advanced Monitoring and Integration Technologies

Advanced monitoring and integration technologies have revolutionized the field of lake restoration by enabling precise, efficient, and adaptive management of aquatic ecosystems. These technologies integrate data collection, analysis, and decision-making processes, offering a holistic approach to monitoring restoration outcomes and informing adaptive management strategies. Remote sensing, artificial intelligence (AI), and real-time monitoring systems have emerged as pivotal tools, enhancing the capacity to track ecological changes, predict restoration outcomes, and optimize intervention strategies [10; 11; 10]. 

Remote sensing technologies, including satellite imagery and aerial photography, provide high-resolution spatial data that enable large-scale assessments of lake conditions. These data are crucial for monitoring changes in water quality, land use, and vegetation cover, which are essential indicators of ecosystem health [10]. The integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with remote sensing data allows for spatially explicit analysis, facilitating the identification of restoration hotspots and the evaluation of intervention efficacy [11]. For instance, studies have demonstrated that multispectral and hyperspectral satellite data can be used to detect changes in chlorophyll-a concentrations, a key indicator of eutrophication, and to assess the effectiveness of bioremediation efforts [10].

Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms have further enhanced the analytical capabilities of lake restoration initiatives. These technologies can process vast volumes of data from multiple sources, including in-situ sensors, remote sensing platforms, and historical records, to identify patterns and predict ecological responses to restoration interventions [10]. For example, deep learning models have been used to classify lake types, detect algal blooms, and predict water quality parameters with high accuracy [10; 11]. AI-driven models such as random forests and neural networks have shown significant improvements in predicting lake temperature dynamics, which are critical for understanding the impacts of climate change on aquatic ecosystems [23]. 

Real-time monitoring systems, including sensor networks and autonomous platforms, offer continuous data collection, enabling adaptive management and early detection of ecological changes. These systems allow for the deployment of sensors that measure parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH at high temporal frequencies, providing insights into short-term fluctuations that may affect lake health [10]. Drones and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have also been employed to collect data in hard-to-reach areas, enhancing the spatial and temporal resolution of monitoring efforts [11]. 

The integration of these advanced technologies into restoration planning is facilitated by decision-support systems and modeling frameworks that synthesize data from multiple sources. These systems enable the development of scenario-based predictions, helping stakeholders to evaluate the potential impacts of different restoration strategies [10]. For instance, models that combine climate projections with land use scenarios can be used to assess the long-term sustainability of restoration efforts under varying environmental conditions [23]. 

Future directions in this field include the development of more integrated and scalable monitoring systems, the refinement of AI algorithms for ecological prediction, and the expansion of real-time data integration into operational restoration practices. As the complexity of lake restoration challenges increases, the role of advanced monitoring and integration technologies will become even more critical in ensuring the effectiveness and sustainability of restoration efforts.

## 5 Case Studies and Practical Applications

### 5.1 Urban Lake Restoration Case Studies

Urban lake restoration presents unique challenges due to the complex interplay between ecological systems and urban infrastructure. These environments are often characterized by high levels of pollution, limited space, and competing land-use demands, necessitating innovative and integrated restoration strategies. This subsection explores several case studies that highlight the diverse approaches taken to restore urban lakes, emphasizing the integration of ecological restoration with urban planning, the role of community engagement, and the application of advanced technologies. 

One notable example is the restoration of the Cheonggyecheon Stream in Seoul, South Korea. Once a natural stream, it was buried under a highway and concrete structures, leading to severe ecological degradation. The restoration project, which involved the removal of the highway and the reintroduction of the stream, employed a combination of physical and ecological restoration techniques [16]. The project not only improved water quality but also revitalized the surrounding urban area, demonstrating the potential of integrating ecological restoration with urban development. The success of Cheonggyecheon was partly attributed to strong community support and participation, highlighting the importance of stakeholder involvement in urban restoration initiatives.

Another case study is the restoration of the Bronx River in New York City, a project that has been ongoing for several decades. The Bronx River, once heavily polluted, has seen significant improvements through a combination of pollution control measures, habitat restoration, and community-based initiatives. The project utilized a multi-disciplinary approach, incorporating green infrastructure, such as rain gardens and bioswales, to manage stormwater runoff and reduce pollution [24]. The involvement of local communities in monitoring and maintaining the river has been crucial to the project's long-term success.

In addition to these examples, the restoration of urban lakes in cities such as London, Berlin, and Singapore has also demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating ecological principles with urban planning. Techniques such as the use of wetland buffers, constructed wetlands, and ecological engineering have been employed to improve water quality and enhance biodiversity [5]. These projects often involve the use of advanced monitoring systems, including remote sensing and real-time data collection, to assess the effectiveness of restoration efforts and guide future interventions.

The case studies presented here underscore the importance of a holistic approach to urban lake restoration, involving not only technical and ecological considerations but also social and political dimensions. As urban areas continue to expand, the need for sustainable and resilient lake restoration strategies becomes increasingly urgent. Future research should focus on developing adaptive management frameworks that can accommodate the dynamic and complex nature of urban ecosystems, ensuring that restoration efforts are both effective and equitable [25].

### 5.2 Rural and Remote Lake Restoration Case Studies

Rural and remote lake restoration projects offer unique insights into the interplay between ecological sensitivity, local community involvement, and the application of traditional knowledge in environmental management. Unlike urban areas, where restoration is often constrained by infrastructure and human activity, rural and remote lakes typically face fewer direct anthropogenic pressures, presenting both opportunities and challenges for restoration. These ecosystems are often more ecologically sensitive due to their isolation and limited human interference, making them critical for studying natural processes and developing sustainable restoration strategies. This subsection examines several case studies that highlight the effectiveness of community-based approaches, integration of traditional ecological knowledge, and adaptive management in rural and remote lake restoration.

One such case is the restoration of Lake Greifensee in Switzerland, where local communities and researchers collaborated to monitor and manage the lake's ecosystem. The use of advanced imaging technologies and deep learning models allowed for accurate identification of zooplankton and phytoplankton, contributing to the understanding of the lake's ecological dynamics [26]. The project demonstrated how technology can be integrated with local ecological knowledge to enhance monitoring and restoration efforts in remote regions. Furthermore, the success of this initiative underscores the importance of involving local stakeholders in decision-making processes, ensuring that restoration strategies align with community needs and ecological goals.

In another example, the use of MODULAR software to analyze the modular structure of ecological networks has provided valuable insights into the resilience of rural and remote lake ecosystems [27]. By identifying key modules within the ecosystem, researchers can better understand how different species interact and how disturbances might propagate through the network. This approach is particularly useful in remote areas where direct observation is difficult, allowing for more targeted and effective restoration strategies.

The role of traditional knowledge in rural and remote lake restoration cannot be overstated. Many indigenous and local communities have developed sophisticated methods for managing their natural resources over generations. These practices often emphasize long-term sustainability and ecological balance, aligning closely with modern restoration principles. For instance, the application of agent-based modeling (ABM) to simulate the effects of social and ecological interactions has shown how traditional practices can be integrated into contemporary restoration frameworks [28]. This integration not only enhances the effectiveness of restoration efforts but also fosters a sense of ownership and stewardship among local communities.

Emerging technologies, such as remote sensing and AI-driven monitoring systems, are increasingly being used to support restoration efforts in rural and remote areas. The use of AI in predicting water quality parameters and detecting contaminants has shown promising results, particularly in regions with limited access to in-situ monitoring infrastructure [29]. These technologies enable more frequent and accurate assessments of lake health, facilitating timely interventions and adaptive management.

Despite the successes, challenges remain in rural and remote lake restoration, including limited funding, lack of technical expertise, and the need for long-term monitoring. However, the integration of local knowledge, advanced technologies, and adaptive management strategies offers a promising pathway forward. Future research should focus on scaling these approaches to other regions and evaluating their long-term effectiveness in maintaining ecological integrity and supporting biodiversity in rural and remote lake ecosystems.

### 5.3 Comparative Evaluation of Restoration Techniques Across Regions

The comparative evaluation of lake restoration techniques across regions reveals significant variations in effectiveness, influenced by geographic, climatic, and ecological conditions. This subsection examines how different restoration approaches perform in temperate, tropical, arid, and humid climates, offering an analytical framework to understand the interplay between local conditions and restoration success. Restoration strategies are inherently context-dependent, with physical, chemical, and biological methods often yielding distinct outcomes based on regional hydrological and ecological characteristics [10].

In temperate regions, such as the Great Lakes in North America, physical and chemical interventions, including aeration and nutrient management, have shown sustained success in improving water quality and reducing eutrophication [10]. These techniques are particularly effective in regions with well-established infrastructure and reliable data on water quality parameters. However, in tropical climates, where high temperatures and intense rainfall patterns enhance nutrient cycling and algal blooms, biological approaches like wetland restoration and bioremediation have proven more effective. For example, in Southeast Asia, the use of constructed wetlands has significantly improved water clarity and biodiversity in degraded lakes [10]. These methods leverage natural ecological processes, which are often more resilient to the dynamic environmental conditions prevalent in tropical regions.

In arid and semi-arid regions, such as the Lake Chad Basin in Africa, water scarcity and high evaporation rates pose unique challenges for restoration. Here, techniques focused on water conservation, such as the construction of detention basins and the use of drought-resistant vegetation, have been critical. The application of remote sensing and GIS technologies has also been instrumental in monitoring water levels and guiding restoration efforts in these data-scarce environments [10]. The integration of these technologies allows for more precise and adaptive management of water resources, which is essential in regions where water availability is highly variable.

Humid regions, such as those in the Amazon Basin, benefit from restoration techniques that emphasize biodiversity and ecosystem resilience. In these areas, the restoration of riparian zones and the reintroduction of native species have been effective in enhancing lake health and supporting aquatic life. For instance, studies in the Amazon have demonstrated that the restoration of native vegetation along lake shores significantly reduces erosion and improves water quality [10]. The effectiveness of these techniques is often linked to the presence of diverse and well-functioning ecosystems, which provide natural buffers against environmental stressors.

Emerging trends in lake restoration highlight the potential of integrating advanced technologies, such as AI and remote sensing, to enhance the precision and scalability of restoration efforts. These tools enable real-time monitoring and adaptive management, which are particularly valuable in regions with complex and dynamic hydrological systems. However, the successful implementation of these technologies requires robust data infrastructure and interdisciplinary collaboration, which can be a challenge in resource-limited regions. As the field of lake restoration continues to evolve, a balanced approach that combines traditional and innovative techniques will be essential for achieving sustainable outcomes across diverse geographic and climatic regions.

### 5.4 Lessons from Restoration Failures and Partial Successes

The subsection on restoration failures and partial successes in lake management reveals critical insights into the limitations and complexities of restoration efforts. These case studies highlight the importance of long-term monitoring, adaptive management, and the integration of ecological, social, and technological factors. While many projects achieve measurable improvements, others face setbacks due to inadequate planning, insufficient resources, or the inability to account for dynamic environmental conditions.

One notable example of restoration failure is the case of Lake Erie, where significant efforts to reduce nutrient loading and mitigate algal blooms have only partially succeeded. Despite the implementation of best management practices (BMPs) and the reduction of phosphorus inputs, eutrophication remains a persistent issue due to the complex interplay of agricultural runoff, climate variability, and hydrological dynamics [23]. This case underscores the importance of not only reducing external nutrient sources but also enhancing the lake’s intrinsic resilience through habitat restoration and water quality monitoring.

Another example is the restoration of Lake Victoria, where the introduction of non-native species, such as the Nile perch, disrupted the lake’s ecological balance, leading to the collapse of native fish populations [21]. Although subsequent efforts have focused on restoring biodiversity and controlling invasive species, the recovery has been slow and uneven. This highlights the need for integrated, ecosystem-based approaches that consider the long-term impacts of species introductions and the importance of stakeholder engagement in restoration planning.

In contrast, the partial success of the restoration of the Great Lakes in North America demonstrates the potential of adaptive management strategies. While significant progress has been made in reducing industrial pollutants and improving water quality, challenges such as climate change, habitat fragmentation, and the persistence of legacy contaminants continue to hinder full recovery [12]. The use of real-time monitoring systems, coupled with predictive modeling, has enabled more responsive and data-driven restoration decisions, illustrating the value of integrating advanced technologies into restoration practices.

The failure of the restoration of Lake Chad, which has shrunk dramatically due to a combination of climate change and overuse of water resources, emphasizes the critical role of watershed-scale management. Despite regional and international efforts to restore the lake, the lack of coordinated policies and the absence of effective water governance have limited the success of restoration initiatives [30]. This case underscores the need for cross-sectoral collaboration and the integration of restoration efforts into broader environmental and socio-economic planning frameworks.

These cases collectively reveal that successful lake restoration requires more than just technical interventions. It demands a deep understanding of the ecological, social, and political contexts in which restoration occurs. Long-term monitoring and adaptive management are essential to track progress, identify emerging challenges, and adjust strategies as needed. Additionally, the integration of interdisciplinary approaches, including remote sensing, machine learning, and community-based monitoring, can enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of restoration efforts. Future research should focus on developing more resilient and scalable restoration frameworks that can withstand the pressures of climate change and human activities.

Remote sensing, for instance, has become a cornerstone in identifying pollution sources, tracking water quality dynamics, and assessing the effectiveness of restoration measures. High-resolution satellite imagery and aerial drones equipped with multispectral and hyperspectral sensors enable the continuous monitoring of lake conditions, providing data that can be used to inform adaptive management strategies [10]. By integrating these data with geographic information systems (GIS), ecologists can generate spatially explicit maps of lake health, facilitating targeted restoration actions [10]. AI, particularly deep learning and machine learning algorithms, has also transformed the field by enabling automated image classification, species identification, and pattern recognition in ecological data. For example, deep learning models have been successfully applied to classify zooplankton and phytoplankton in lake ecosystems, significantly improving the efficiency of biodiversity monitoring [10]. Moreover, AI-driven predictive models can forecast water temperature, nutrient dynamics, and algal bloom occurrences, allowing for early intervention and adaptive management [10]. Autonomous systems, such as underwater robots and drones, are further enhancing the feasibility of in situ monitoring and remediation. These systems can navigate complex lake environments, collect real-time data, and even perform targeted interventions such as nutrient removal or sediment stabilization [11]. The integration of AI with autonomous systems, for instance, allows for the development of adaptive control strategies that respond dynamically to changing environmental conditions [12]. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in terms of data integration, model generalizability, and the scalability of technology-driven solutions. The high computational demands of AI and the need for extensive, high-quality training data pose practical limitations, particularly in data-scarce regions. Furthermore, the ethical and ecological implications of deploying autonomous systems in natural environments require careful consideration [10]. As the field progresses, future directions will likely involve the development of more robust, interpretable AI models, the integration of multi-sensor data platforms, and the exploration of hybrid approaches that combine technological innovations with traditional ecological knowledge. These advancements hold the potential to significantly enhance the resilience and sustainability of lake ecosystems in the face of ongoing environmental challenges [12].

## 6 Policy, Governance, and Stakeholder Engagement

### 6.1 National and International Policy Frameworks

The subsection on national and international policy frameworks in lake restoration highlights the critical role of legal and regulatory instruments in guiding sustainable management and restoration of freshwater ecosystems. At the international level, key agreements such as the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, the United Nations Watercourses Convention, and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) provide a foundational framework for transboundary cooperation and ecosystem-based management [4]. These agreements establish principles for the conservation and sustainable use of aquatic resources, emphasizing the need for integrated water resource management and the protection of biodiversity. For instance, the Ramsar Convention recognizes wetlands as vital ecosystems that support ecological processes and provide essential services, including water filtration and habitat for diverse species [24]. The CBD further promotes the development of national biodiversity strategies and action plans, which often incorporate lake restoration as a key component of conservation efforts [31]. 

At the national level, policies and regulations vary widely, reflecting the diverse ecological, economic, and social contexts of different countries. Many nations have enacted water quality standards, environmental impact assessment protocols, and land-use planning policies that influence lake restoration initiatives. For example, the European Union’s Water Framework Directive (WFD) establishes a comprehensive approach to the protection and improvement of water bodies, requiring member states to achieve "good ecological status" in all water bodies, including lakes [9]. In the United States, the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) provide a legal foundation for regulating pollutants and ensuring the protection of water resources. These laws have been instrumental in driving lake restoration efforts, particularly through programs such as the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which focuses on reducing pollution, restoring habitats, and improving water quality in the Great Lakes Basin [32]. 

Transboundary water management frameworks, such as the Danube River Basin Management Plan and the Nile Basin Initiative, further illustrate the importance of international cooperation in addressing shared environmental challenges. These frameworks often involve multiple stakeholders, including governments, non-governmental organizations, and local communities, and emphasize the need for adaptive management and stakeholder engagement [3]. However, the implementation of these policies is frequently hindered by institutional fragmentation, lack of coordination, and insufficient funding [33].

These structures are essential for the planning, implementation, and long-term monitoring of restoration initiatives, ensuring that ecological, economic, and social dimensions are adequately addressed. Effective governance models are crucial in coordinating these diverse stakeholders, mitigating conflicts, and aligning restoration goals with broader environmental and developmental objectives. The institutional landscape varies significantly across regions, influenced by factors such as legal frameworks, funding mechanisms, and the level of stakeholder participation.

At the core of these governance models are governmental agencies responsible for setting regulatory standards, enforcing environmental laws, and allocating resources for restoration. In many countries, these responsibilities are distributed across multiple agencies, leading to potential fragmentation and inefficiencies. For instance, the European Union's Water Framework Directive [36] provides a comprehensive framework for water management, but its implementation often requires coordination between national, regional, and local authorities. This complexity is further compounded by the need for cross-border cooperation in transboundary lake systems, where multiple jurisdictions must align their policies and management practices [36].

Non-governmental organizations and research institutions play a pivotal role in supporting lake restoration through scientific research, public awareness campaigns, and community engagement. These entities often act as intermediaries between policymakers and local stakeholders, facilitating the exchange of knowledge and resources. For example, the integration of citizen science initiatives and community-based monitoring programs has been shown to enhance the effectiveness of restoration projects by leveraging local ecological knowledge and fostering a sense of ownership among residents [36]. However, the sustainability of these efforts depends on consistent funding and institutional support, which are often limited.

Decentralized governance models, such as watershed councils and local water resource management authorities, have emerged as promising alternatives to centralized approaches. These models emphasize participatory decision-making and adaptive management, enabling more responsive and context-specific restoration strategies. However, their success hinges on the capacity of local institutions to manage complex ecological and socio-economic dynamics, which can be challenging in resource-constrained settings [36].

The development of innovative governance frameworks, including the use of digital tools and data-driven decision-making, represents a growing trend in lake restoration. Technologies such as remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), and machine learning are increasingly being integrated into monitoring and management practices, enabling more precise and timely interventions [36]. These advancements not only improve the efficiency of restoration projects but also enhance transparency and accountability, fostering greater public trust and stakeholder collaboration.

Despite these developments, significant challenges remain in achieving coordinated and effective lake restoration. Institutional fragmentation, limited resources, and the dynamic nature of ecological systems continue to pose barriers. Future research and policy efforts should focus on strengthening institutional capacities, promoting cross-sectoral collaboration, and leveraging emerging technologies to enhance the resilience and sustainability of lake ecosystems. By addressing these challenges, governance models can play a pivotal role in ensuring the long-term success of lake restoration initiatives.

This subsection explores the critical role that local communities, indigenous groups, and other stakeholders play in the lake restoration process, emphasizing the importance of inclusive and participatory approaches. By involving these groups, restoration initiatives can benefit from localized knowledge, cultural insights, and social acceptance, which are essential for long-term success.

Community-based organizations and citizen science initiatives have emerged as powerful tools for fostering stakeholder engagement. These initiatives enable local residents to contribute to data collection, monitoring, and decision-making processes, thereby enhancing the relevance and effectiveness of restoration strategies [10]. For instance, studies have shown that the use of local knowledge can significantly improve the accuracy of ecological assessments and the appropriateness of restoration measures [10]. Furthermore, participatory decision-making processes have been found to increase the likelihood of project success by ensuring that the needs and perspectives of all stakeholders are considered [10].

Communication strategies and public awareness campaigns are also vital components of stakeholder engagement. Effective communication can build trust, resolve conflicts, and foster collaboration among diverse stakeholders. Research has demonstrated that transparent and consistent communication can lead to higher levels of community support and participation in restoration projects [10]. In addition, the use of digital platforms and social media has expanded the reach of these campaigns, enabling broader engagement and real-time feedback [10].

Partnerships between government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local communities have proven to be highly effective in achieving restoration goals. These partnerships leverage the strengths of each party, combining technical expertise, resources, and local knowledge [11]. For example, collaborative efforts have led to the development of community-led restoration projects that are more responsive to local conditions and more likely to be sustained over time [12].

Despite the benefits of stakeholder engagement, several challenges remain. These include issues of power dynamics, resource allocation, and the need for continuous capacity building. Addressing these challenges requires a commitment to equity, transparency, and adaptive management. Emerging trends in stakeholder engagement, such as the use of digital tools and data-driven approaches, offer promising avenues for overcoming these challenges and enhancing the inclusiveness of restoration initiatives [10].

In conclusion, the active involvement of stakeholders and the community is essential for the success of lake restoration projects. By adopting inclusive and participatory approaches, restoration efforts can achieve greater ecological, social, and economic outcomes. Future research should continue to explore innovative strategies for stakeholder engagement and the integration of diverse perspectives in the restoration process.

### 6.4 Challenges in Multi-Sectoral Coordination

The coordination of lake restoration efforts across multiple sectors, jurisdictions, and stakeholders is a complex challenge that significantly influences the success and sustainability of restoration initiatives. This subsection explores the systemic barriers to multi-sectoral coordination and examines potential solutions, emphasizing the need for integrated, adaptive, and inclusive governance frameworks. The complexity arises from the divergent interests, regulatory frameworks, and operational capacities of the involved actors, including governmental agencies, private industries, local communities, and non-governmental organizations [10]. These actors often operate under different mandates, which can lead to conflicting priorities and inefficiencies in decision-making and implementation.

One of the primary challenges in multi-sectoral coordination is the lack of a unified governance structure that can harmonize the diverse interests and responsibilities of the stakeholders. For example, agricultural sectors may prioritize economic growth and food production, while environmental agencies focus on conservation and ecological integrity. This divergence can result in policy fragmentation and hinder the development of holistic restoration strategies [10]. Moreover, the legal and administrative hurdles associated with cross-jurisdictional projects, such as conflicting regulations and inconsistent enforcement mechanisms, further complicate coordination efforts [10]. 

The integration of scientific and technical knowledge with policy and stakeholder input is another critical challenge. Effective lake restoration requires the synthesis of ecological data, socio-economic analyses, and community-based insights, yet these elements are often siloed within different institutions and disciplines. This fragmentation can lead to suboptimal decision-making and a lack of adaptive management strategies that respond to dynamic environmental conditions [10]. To address this, innovative approaches such as adaptive governance and integrated water resource management have been proposed to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and foster collaboration among stakeholders [10].

Technological advancements, such as remote sensing, GIS, and AI-driven monitoring systems, offer promising tools for improving coordination by providing real-time data and enabling participatory decision-making [11]. However, the effective utilization of these technologies requires not only technical capacity but also institutional and policy support to ensure equitable access and data sharing. Additionally, the engagement of local communities and indigenous groups is essential for the long-term sustainability of restoration projects, as their traditional knowledge and practices can complement scientific approaches [12].

In conclusion, the challenges of multi-sectoral coordination in lake restoration necessitate a paradigm shift towards more inclusive, adaptive, and integrated governance models. Future research and practice should focus on developing frameworks that enhance stakeholder collaboration, ensure the alignment of interests, and leverage technological innovations to support evidence-based decision-making. By addressing these challenges, the prospects for successful and sustainable lake restoration can be significantly improved [10; 12].

### 6.5 Emerging Trends and Future Directions

One of the most significant emerging trends is the incorporation of digital technologies into policy-making and governance. The use of artificial intelligence (AI), remote sensing, and big data analytics is transforming how ecological data is collected, analyzed, and utilized in decision-making processes. For instance, AI-driven monitoring systems enable real-time assessment of lake health, while satellite imagery and GIS tools allow for the identification of pollution sources and restoration targets [10]. These advancements not only improve the precision of policy interventions but also enhance transparency and accountability in governance. The application of machine learning to ecological network analysis [10] further underscores the potential of data-driven approaches in predicting species interactions and informing restoration strategies.

Another critical trend is the move toward more inclusive and participatory governance models. Traditional top-down approaches are increasingly being replaced by bottom-up strategies that prioritize stakeholder engagement, community involvement, and local knowledge. This shift aligns with the concept of "citizen-centric governance," where policies are co-created with affected communities, ensuring that restoration efforts reflect local needs and values [10]. The role of social media in understanding public perceptions of cultural ecosystem services [10] illustrates how digital platforms can facilitate dialogue and enhance the responsiveness of governance structures.

Equity and justice are also becoming central to lake restoration policies. There is a growing recognition that environmental degradation disproportionately affects marginalized communities, and that restoration efforts must address these inequities. This is reflected in the increasing use of payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes and green bonds to finance sustainable restoration [11]. These mechanisms not only provide financial incentives for conservation but also promote social inclusion by involving local stakeholders in decision-making processes.

Looking ahead, the future of lake restoration governance will likely be shaped by the continued convergence of ecological science, technology, and social innovation. The integration of multiscale socio-ecological networks [12] and the development of adaptive management frameworks [10] offer promising pathways for enhancing the resilience and sustainability of lake ecosystems. As the field progresses, the challenge will be to balance technological advancements with ethical considerations, ensuring that policy innovations are both effective and equitable. The successful implementation of these emerging trends will depend on fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, strengthening institutional capacity, and maintaining a long-term commitment to sustainable lake management.

## 7 Monitoring, Assessment, and Evaluation

### 7.1 Ecological and Hydrological Indicators for Lake Health

Ecological and hydrological indicators are essential for evaluating the health of restored lakes, providing a quantitative basis for assessing restoration effectiveness and long-term sustainability. These indicators encompass a range of biological, chemical, and physical parameters that reflect the functional integrity and resilience of aquatic ecosystems. They are critical for monitoring the success of restoration interventions and guiding adaptive management strategies. Ecological indicators often focus on biotic components, such as species diversity, trophic interactions, and community composition, while hydrological indicators emphasize physical and chemical processes, such as water flow, temperature, and nutrient cycling. The integration of these indicators allows for a holistic understanding of lake dynamics, enabling researchers and managers to identify trends, detect anomalies, and make informed decisions [23].

Key ecological indicators include chlorophyll-a concentrations, which serve as a proxy for primary productivity and algal biomass, and dissolved oxygen levels, which reflect the metabolic activity and overall water quality of a lake [10]. Species diversity indices, such as the Shannon-Wiener index or Simpson's diversity index, are also widely used to assess the health of aquatic communities and the effectiveness of restoration efforts in promoting biodiversity [10]. Additionally, functional indicators, such as the presence of key species or the occurrence of specific ecological interactions, can provide insights into the ecological processes that underpin lake resilience. These indicators are often used in conjunction with biogeochemical metrics, such as nutrient concentrations (e.g., total phosphorus and total nitrogen) and water clarity, to evaluate the overall ecological status of a lake [10].

Hydrological indicators, on the other hand, provide insights into the physical and chemical stability of lake systems. Metrics such as water level fluctuations, inflow and outflow rates, and sedimentation patterns are essential for understanding the hydrological regime and its influence on lake health [10]. For instance, water residence time, which is calculated as the volume of water in a lake divided by its outflow rate, is a critical factor in determining the retention and dilution of nutrients and pollutants [10]. Additionally, temperature profiles, which can be measured using in-situ sensors or remote sensing technologies, are important for assessing the thermal structure of lakes and its impact on aquatic life [11].

The development and application of these indicators have evolved significantly with the integration of advanced technologies, such as remote sensing, GIS, and machine learning [12]. These tools enable the continuous and real-time monitoring of lake systems, facilitating the detection of subtle changes in ecological and hydrological conditions. However, the interpretation of monitoring data remains a challenge, requiring robust analytical frameworks and adaptive management approaches [10]. Future research should focus on improving the standardization of indicator protocols, enhancing the integration of multi-scale data, and developing predictive models that can better anticipate the long-term impacts of restoration efforts. By advancing the use of ecological and hydrological indicators, researchers can more effectively evaluate the success of lake restoration and ensure the sustainability of freshwater ecosystems [12].

Among the most widely used approaches are satellite-based remote sensing, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and in-situ sensor networks, each contributing unique advantages in data collection and analysis [14; 37].

Satellite remote sensing, particularly through platforms like Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, provides a cost-effective means of monitoring large-scale lake conditions over extended periods. For instance, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have been utilized to detect lake ice cover and monitor changes in water surface characteristics, offering insights into seasonal and long-term variations [22]. Similarly, Sentinel-2's multispectral imagery has been leveraged to estimate chlorophyll-a concentrations, an essential indicator of eutrophication and algal blooms [10]. The integration of satellite data with machine learning algorithms further enhances the accuracy and efficiency of these assessments, as demonstrated in studies that have used deep learning models to predict water quality parameters such as temperature, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen [10; 10].

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) complement satellite-based monitoring by providing high-frequency, high-resolution data at the local scale. Equipped with multispectral and hyperspectral sensors, UAVs can capture detailed information about water clarity, vegetation health, and sediment resuspension, which are critical for evaluating the effectiveness of restoration interventions [37]. These platforms are particularly useful in monitoring dynamic processes such as algal blooms and shoreline erosion, where rapid changes require frequent data collection [21].

In-situ sensor networks, including automated water quality monitoring stations, offer continuous, real-time data that are essential for detecting short-term fluctuations and responding to emerging issues. These systems typically employ sensors for measuring parameters such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity, and can be integrated with wireless communication technologies to enable remote data access and analysis [10]. The combination of in-situ data with remote sensing and machine learning models enhances the ability to predict and manage lake conditions, supporting adaptive management strategies [10].

Despite the advancements in remote sensing and data acquisition technologies, challenges remain in data integration, calibration, and interpretation. For example, the accuracy of satellite-derived products can be affected by atmospheric interference, cloud cover, and sensor limitations, necessitating the use of ground-truthing and data fusion techniques [10]. Moreover, the interpretation of complex datasets often requires advanced analytical tools, such as statistical modeling and machine learning, to extract meaningful insights [10].

Looking ahead, the integration of emerging technologies, such as autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, holds great promise for further enhancing the capabilities of remote sensing and data acquisition in lake monitoring. These innovations are expected to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of data, enabling more precise and timely assessments of lake health and restoration outcomes [10; 10]. As the field continues to evolve, the development of standardized protocols and interdisciplinary collaboration will be essential to maximize the utility of these technologies in lake restoration efforts.

### 7.3 Long-Term Monitoring and Adaptive Management

Long-term monitoring and adaptive management are essential components of effective lake restoration, ensuring that restoration efforts remain responsive to dynamic environmental conditions and evolving ecological outcomes. Unlike short-term assessments, long-term monitoring provides the necessary data to detect gradual changes in lake ecosystems, validate the success of restoration interventions, and identify emerging challenges. This approach allows for the iterative refinement of management strategies, aligning them with the complex, often nonlinear dynamics of aquatic systems [38]. The integration of long-term monitoring and adaptive management not only enhances the resilience of restored lakes but also improves the overall effectiveness of restoration programs in the face of climate change, land-use shifts, and other stressors.

The implementation of long-term monitoring requires a robust framework of ecological and hydrological indicators, tailored to the specific characteristics of the lake and its watershed. Indicators such as chlorophyll-a concentrations, dissolved oxygen levels, and species diversity provide critical insights into biological health, while hydrological metrics like water level fluctuations and inflow-outflow rates assess physical and chemical stability [24]. These indicators must be standardized and consistently measured over time to ensure comparability and reliability, facilitating the identification of trends and the evaluation of restoration success. Remote sensing, in-situ sensors, and advanced data acquisition technologies have revolutionized the capacity for continuous and real-time monitoring, allowing for high-resolution spatial and temporal data collection [39]. For instance, the use of satellite imagery and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enables the tracking of changes in lake surface area, vegetation cover, and water quality, while in-situ sensor networks provide high-frequency measurements of key water quality parameters. The integration of these technologies enhances the accuracy and comprehensiveness of monitoring efforts, supporting more informed and timely management decisions.

Adaptive management frameworks, grounded in long-term monitoring, are designed to incorporate feedback and new data into restoration planning and implementation. This iterative process allows for the continuous improvement of restoration strategies, ensuring that they remain aligned with ecological goals and environmental changes. Techniques such as time-series analysis and trend modeling are essential in identifying patterns and predicting future conditions, enabling proactive decision-making [40]. For example, machine learning algorithms, as demonstrated in the work of [41], have been successfully applied to model lake temperature and water quality dynamics, providing valuable insights for adaptive management. However, the successful application of adaptive management requires not only technological advancements but also interdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder engagement, ensuring that management strategies are both scientifically sound and socially acceptable.

Emerging trends in lake restoration emphasize the importance of integrating big data, advanced analytics, and predictive modeling into long-term monitoring and adaptive management. The application of deep learning techniques, as highlighted in [42], offers new opportunities for improving the accuracy and efficiency of lake monitoring and management. Furthermore, the use of transfer learning, as demonstrated in [43], allows for the extrapolation of models to unmonitored lakes, enhancing the scalability of restoration efforts. As the field continues to evolve, the development of more sophisticated monitoring and adaptive management systems will be crucial in addressing the complex challenges of lake restoration in a rapidly changing world.

### 7.4 Data Interpretation and Decision Support

Data interpretation and decision support are critical components of lake restoration, bridging the gap between raw monitoring data and actionable insights for ecological management. Effective interpretation requires not only advanced analytical techniques but also a systematic integration of monitoring results into restoration planning, ensuring that decisions are informed, adaptive, and scientifically grounded. This process is inherently complex due to the multifaceted nature of lake ecosystems and the variability of environmental data across spatial and temporal scales. Recent advancements in machine learning, statistical modeling, and data fusion have provided powerful tools to address these challenges, enabling more precise and dynamic decision-making frameworks [10].

One of the primary challenges in data interpretation is the need to extract meaningful patterns from large, heterogeneous datasets that often include both observational and model-derived information. Techniques such as machine learning and statistical modeling have been increasingly employed to analyze these datasets, offering improved accuracy and predictive capability. For instance, deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable performance in identifying and classifying ecological features from remote sensing data, supporting real-time monitoring and long-term trend analysis [10; 10]. These methods not only enhance the resolution and reliability of monitoring results but also facilitate the detection of subtle changes in lake health that may be missed by traditional approaches.

Decision support in lake restoration involves translating monitoring outcomes into strategic actions that align with restoration objectives. This requires the development of robust frameworks that integrate monitoring data with ecological models, stakeholder input, and policy considerations. Adaptive management has emerged as a key strategy, allowing for iterative adjustments based on new data and changing conditions. The integration of real-time monitoring systems with predictive models, such as those based on artificial intelligence and remote sensing, has further enhanced the responsiveness of restoration efforts [10].

Despite these advances, several challenges remain. The inherent uncertainty in environmental data, coupled with the complexity of ecological systems, necessitates the development of methods that can quantify and manage variability effectively. Techniques such as uncertainty quantification and error analysis are essential for ensuring the reliability of monitoring results and supporting transparent, evidence-based decisions [37; 44]. Furthermore, the integration of monitoring data into decision-making processes requires not only technical sophistication but also strong collaboration across disciplines, including ecologists, data scientists, and policymakers.

Looking ahead, the future of data interpretation and decision support in lake restoration will likely involve the continued development of hybrid models that combine empirical data with mechanistic understanding. Advances in data fusion, interpretability, and real-time analytics will be crucial in enhancing the practical applicability of monitoring systems. Additionally, the adoption of more inclusive and participatory approaches will ensure that decisions reflect both scientific rigor and local knowledge, ultimately contributing to more sustainable and equitable restoration outcomes [10; 10; 10].

## 8 Conclusion

Lake restoration is a complex and multifaceted endeavor that requires a deep understanding of ecological, hydrological, and socio-economic dynamics. This subsection synthesizes the key findings, challenges, and opportunities in lake restoration research and practice, emphasizing the urgent need for interdisciplinary collaboration, innovative technologies, and sustainable governance frameworks to enhance the effectiveness of restoration efforts in the face of global environmental change. 

A central finding of this survey is the critical role of ecological and hydrological principles in shaping lake restoration outcomes. The natural functioning of lake ecosystems, characterized by nutrient cycles, water quality dynamics, and biotic-abiotic interactions, is essential for achieving ecological recovery and stability [45]. However, anthropogenic activities such as pollution, sedimentation, and land-use changes have significantly disrupted these processes, compounding the challenges of lake restoration [45]. In this context, the integration of ecological and hydrological data through advanced monitoring technologies, such as remote sensing and GIS, has proven invaluable in assessing lake conditions and guiding restoration strategies [46]. For example, the application of high-resolution satellite imagery and in-situ sensors has enabled the continuous tracking of water quality parameters and habitat changes, supporting data-driven decision-making [46].

Despite these advances, the restoration of degraded lakes remains a formidable challenge. Eutrophication, driven by nutrient loading, continues to be a major threat to lake ecosystems, leading to algal blooms, oxygen depletion, and biodiversity loss [46]. Similarly, the management of invasive species poses significant difficulties, as these organisms can alter native food webs and reduce the resilience of lake ecosystems [46]. In response, a growing body of research has explored the use of biological and ecological approaches, such as bioremediation, wetland restoration, and species reintroduction, to enhance natural processes and promote ecological recovery [46]. For instance, the application of transfer learning and ensemble models has shown promising results in the identification of lake zooplankton, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ecological monitoring [26].

Moreover, the role of emerging technologies, such as AI and machine learning, in lake restoration has gained increasing attention. These tools have demonstrated the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of restoration planning, enabling predictive modeling of water temperature, pollutant dispersion, and ecological responses [5]. Additionally, the integration of AI with remote sensing and IoT-based monitoring systems has opened new possibilities for real-time data collection and adaptive management [46]. However, the effective deployment of these technologies requires robust data infrastructures and interdisciplinary collaboration, as highlighted by the development of data lakes and lakehouses, which support the storage, processing, and analysis of large-scale environmental data [47].

Looking ahead, future research should focus on developing more integrated and adaptive restoration frameworks that account for the complex interactions between ecological, social, and technological factors. The establishment of open science platforms and reproducible research practices is also essential for ensuring the transparency and reliability of restoration outcomes [4]. Furthermore, the incorporation of community-based approaches and participatory decision-making processes is critical for enhancing the sustainability and acceptance of restoration initiatives [48]. As global environmental challenges continue to evolve, the need for innovative, inclusive, and science-based lake restoration strategies has never been more pressing.
