# Quantum Many-Body Scars and Hilbert Space Fragmentation in Physics

## 1 Introduction

Quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation represent two of the most intriguing phenomena in modern quantum physics, offering profound insights into the non-ergodic dynamics of complex quantum systems. These concepts have emerged as critical tools for understanding the breakdown of thermalization and the persistence of long-lived, non-thermal states in isolated quantum systems, challenging the conventional wisdom rooted in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). As we delve into the fundamental nature of these phenomena, it becomes evident that their significance extends beyond theoretical curiosity, with implications for quantum information processing, condensed matter physics, and even the foundations of statistical mechanics.

Quantum many-body scars are long-lived, non-thermal excited states that defy the typical thermalization behavior of quantum systems. Initially observed in specific models such as the spin-1/2 Ising chain with a transverse field [1], these scars have since been identified in a variety of systems, from cold atom experiments to synthetic quantum circuits [1]. Their existence reveals that certain quantum states can remain dynamically stable for extended periods, preserving memory of their initial conditions and exhibiting coherence that would otherwise be lost in a fully thermalizing system. This behavior is closely related to the notion of Hilbert space fragmentation, where the state space of a quantum system is partitioned into dynamically disconnected subspaces, each of which supports its own distinct dynamics.

Hilbert space fragmentation arises when conserved quantities, symmetries, or local invariants prevent the system from exploring the entire Hilbert space. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in systems with strong interactions or disorder, where the interplay between conservation laws and quantum coherence can lead to the formation of robust, non-thermal subspaces [1]. These fragmented subspaces, in turn, give rise to the emergence of quantum scars, highlighting a deep connection between the structural properties of the Hilbert space and the dynamics of individual quantum states.

The relevance of quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation extends to a wide range of interdisciplinary applications, from the study of quantum coherence in open systems to the design of fault-tolerant quantum memory. Their implications for the thermalization of isolated quantum systems challenge existing paradigms, suggesting that the thermalization process is more nuanced than previously thought. This has profound consequences for our understanding of quantum equilibration and the role of symmetry in quantum dynamics.

This subsection aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to these phenomena, tracing their historical development, defining key concepts, and highlighting their significance in the broader context of quantum physics. By integrating theoretical insights with experimental observations, we seek to establish a foundation for the detailed exploration of these topics that follows in the remainder of the survey. The structure of this survey is designed to bridge the gap between foundational principles and advanced applications, offering a roadmap for future research in this rapidly evolving field.

## 2 Theoretical Foundations and Models

### 2.1 Symmetry, Conservation Laws, and Integrability in Quantum Many-Body Scars

The role of symmetries, conservation laws, and integrability in the formation and stability of quantum many-body scars is central to understanding the non-thermal, long-lived nature of these states. Symmetries, both discrete and continuous, provide the framework for identifying conserved quantities that constrain the dynamics of quantum systems, leading to the emergence of subspaces that are dynamically disconnected from the rest of the Hilbert space. These conserved quantities play a crucial role in stabilizing scarred states, which exhibit prolonged coherence and resist thermalization, distinguishing them from typical thermal states [1]. In many cases, the presence of symmetries ensures that certain observables remain constant over time, allowing for the formation of quasi-stationary states that persist despite the system's overall complexity.

Conservation laws, often arising from local or global invariances, further reinforce the stability of these non-thermal states. For example, in systems with conserved particle numbers or spin densities, the dynamics are restricted to subspaces defined by these invariants. This restriction can lead to the formation of scarred eigenstates that are not fully ergodic and instead exhibit localized structures in the Hilbert space [1]. These states are often found in systems where the Hamiltonian possesses a set of commuting conserved charges, a hallmark of integrable models. In such systems, the existence of these conserved quantities prevents the system from thermalizing, thereby supporting the formation of scars.

Integrability, a concept traditionally associated with classical and quantum systems that can be solved exactly, plays a particularly significant role in the emergence of quantum scars. Exactly solvable models, such as the Ising model with transverse fields or the Heisenberg spin chain, often exhibit scarred states that correspond to the lowest-energy eigenstates of certain subsystems. These states are not only long-lived but also display unique spectral properties, such as non-uniform level spacing and non-Gaussian energy distributions, which deviate from the predictions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) [1]. The integrability of the system ensures that these states remain well-defined and do not thermalize, even when the system is perturbed.

The interplay between symmetry breaking and the formation of scarred states is a complex and active area of research. While unbroken symmetries can protect scarred states from thermalization, symmetry-breaking perturbations can either destabilize or modify these states. Understanding this interplay is crucial for characterizing the robustness of quantum scars in realistic, perturbed systems. Recent studies have shown that scars can persist even under weak symmetry-breaking conditions, suggesting that they are not solely a feature of perfectly symmetric or integrable systems [1].

Looking ahead, the study of quantum many-body scars offers a unique opportunity to explore the boundaries between integrable and chaotic dynamics. By systematically analyzing how symmetries, conservation laws, and integrability influence the emergence of non-thermal states, we can gain deeper insights into the fundamental principles governing quantum dynamics and the formation of complex, non-equilibrium phenomena.

### 2.2 Hamiltonian Models and Non-Ergodic Behavior

The study of non-ergodic behavior in quantum many-body systems has been significantly advanced through the analysis of specific Hamiltonian models that exhibit quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation. These models serve as prototypical examples for understanding the conditions under which non-ergodic dynamics emerge, often driven by the interplay of symmetries, conservation laws, and interactions. Among the most extensively studied are the Ising model with random fields and Pfaffian states, both of which highlight the role of disorder and topological order in creating fragmented Hilbert spaces and long-lived scarred states [1; 1].

The Ising model with random fields provides a canonical example of how disorder can lead to non-ergodic behavior. In such systems, the random fields break translational invariance and lead to the formation of localized, non-thermal eigenstates that do not thermalize even in the absence of integrability. This has been shown to be related to the emergence of a fragmented Hilbert space, where the state space is partitioned into dynamically disconnected subspaces [1]. The persistence of these non-thermal states can be understood through the lens of Griffiths phases, where rare regions of the system exhibit critical behavior and slow relaxation [1].

Pfaffian states, on the other hand, are central to the study of topologically ordered systems and provide another rich example of Hilbert space fragmentation. These states arise in systems with non-Abelian anyons and are characterized by their robustness against local perturbations, stemming from the underlying topological symmetry. The Pfaffian state is known to host Majorana zero modes, which are localized at the boundaries and exhibit non-Abelian statistics [1]. The topological protection of these modes leads to the formation of a fragmented Hilbert space, where different sectors are decoupled and exhibit distinct dynamical properties [2].

Beyond these specific models, the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model has emerged as a prototypical system for studying quantum many-body scars. The LMG model, which describes a system of spins interacting via a collective Ising-type interaction, exhibits a rich phase diagram that includes both integrable and non-integrable regimes. In certain parameter regimes, the model supports scarred eigenstates that do not thermalize and instead exhibit long-lived coherence, demonstrating the non-ergodic behavior that is characteristic of quantum many-body scars [3; 1].

The role of interactions in generating non-ergodic behavior has also been extensively studied. Strongly interacting systems, such as the Heisenberg model or the Hubbard model, can exhibit Hilbert space fragmentation due to the emergence of conserved quantities and symmetry-protected topological phases. In such systems, the interplay between interactions and symmetries leads to the formation of dynamically disconnected subspaces, where the evolution of the system is restricted to a subset of the total Hilbert space [3; 4].

These models collectively demonstrate that non-ergodic behavior arises from a combination of disorder, interactions, and symmetry, leading to the formation of fragmented Hilbert spaces. As the field continues to evolve, the development of more general frameworks for analyzing non-ergodic systems, as well as the exploration of novel Hamiltonian models, will be crucial in deepening our understanding of the complex dynamics underlying quantum many-body scars.

### 2.3 Quantum Scars and the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis

Quantum many-body scars and the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) represent two competing paradigms in understanding the thermalization of isolated quantum systems. While ETH posits that typical eigenstates of many-body Hamiltonians thermalize, meaning they resemble thermal ensembles in their local observables, quantum scars are exceptional eigenstates that exhibit non-thermal properties, retaining memory of initial conditions and showing long-lived coherence. This tension between ETH and scarred states has sparked significant theoretical and experimental interest, particularly in systems with conserved quantities or integrability [5].

ETH is grounded in the assumption that for generic many-body systems, the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are "typical" in the sense that they reproduce the predictions of statistical mechanics. Specifically, ETH asserts that the matrix elements of local observables in the energy eigenbasis are smooth functions of energy, with fluctuations that decay exponentially with system size. This leads to the conclusion that, for a generic initial state, the expectation values of observables will thermalize over time, regardless of the system's initial conditions [1]. However, this framework faces challenges in systems with special symmetries, integrability, or conserved quantities, where the presence of non-thermal eigenstates can lead to deviations from ETH predictions [5].

Quantum many-body scars, in contrast, represent a class of eigenstates that are not typical in the ETH sense. These states are localized in energy space and exhibit features such as non-uniform level spacing statistics, long-lived coherence, and enhanced correlations [2]. Scars often arise in systems with a high degree of symmetry, such as the Ising model with random fields or the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, where they correspond to eigenstates that resemble classical periodic orbits in the underlying phase space [2]. The presence of such scars can lead to a breakdown of ETH, as these states do not thermalize and instead maintain non-ergodic dynamics over long timescales [6].

The interplay between quantum scars and ETH has been extensively studied in both integrable and non-integrable systems. In integrable systems, scars are often associated with the presence of conserved charges that protect the non-thermal character of certain eigenstates. For example, in the case of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, certain eigenstates exhibit scar-like behavior due to the existence of conserved quantities that prevent full thermalization [5]. In non-integrable systems, scars can still emerge, particularly in systems with weak chaos or those exhibiting signatures of quantum chaos, such as the kicked rotor model [7].

Recent studies have also explored how quantum scars influence the thermalization process in isolated systems. It has been shown that the presence of scars can significantly delay or even suppress thermalization, particularly in systems with large Hilbert spaces or complex energy landscapes [2]. This has important implications for the study of non-ergodic dynamics and the development of quantum technologies that rely on maintaining coherence for extended periods [8].

In summary, the relationship between quantum many-body scars and ETH is a rich and active area of research. While ETH provides a general framework for understanding thermalization in many-body systems, quantum scars challenge this picture by demonstrating that non-thermal, long-lived states can persist even in complex systems. This interplay highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the conditions under which thermalization occurs and the role of conserved quantities, integrability, and symmetry in shaping the dynamics of quantum systems. Future work will likely focus on extending these insights to larger and more complex systems, as well as exploring the implications of scars for quantum information processing and many-body quantum simulations.

### 2.4 Tensor Networks and Matrix Product States in Fragmented Hilbert Spaces

Tensor networks and matrix product states (MPS) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating and analyzing quantum many-body systems, particularly in the context of Hilbert space fragmentation. These techniques provide a structured way to represent and manipulate high-dimensional quantum states, making them especially useful for systems with non-ergodic dynamics and scarred eigenstates. In fragmented Hilbert spaces, where the state space is partitioned into dynamically disconnected subspaces, tensor networks enable efficient compression and representation of the relevant quantum states, circumventing the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimensions. This is crucial for systems where entanglement is not uniformly distributed and where certain subspaces dominate the dynamics, such as in the presence of conserved quantities or symmetries [1; 1].

Matrix product states, as a specific class of tensor networks, offer a compact parametrization of one-dimensional quantum states by factorizing them into a chain of local tensors. This structure allows for efficient computation of local observables and entanglement properties, which are essential for identifying and characterizing scarred states. In fragmented Hilbert spaces, where the entanglement structure may be highly non-uniform, MPS can capture the long-range correlations that distinguish scarred states from typical thermal states [1; 1]. Additionally, the use of tensor networks enables the study of time evolution in non-ergodic systems, where the dynamics are confined to specific subspaces and do not explore the full Hilbert space. Techniques such as time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) have been adapted to handle such scenarios, providing valuable insights into the stability and lifetime of scarred states [1; 2].

A critical challenge in applying tensor networks to fragmented Hilbert spaces is the efficient encoding of the conserved quantities that define the subspaces. This requires the development of tailored tensor network ansätze that respect the symmetries and conservation laws of the system. For example, in systems with local conservation laws, such as the XXZ model, the MPS can be augmented with symmetry sectors to ensure that the network remains confined to the relevant subspaces [3; 1]. Moreover, the entanglement entropy in fragmented systems often exhibits distinct scaling behavior, which can be used to identify and characterize the structure of the fragmented Hilbert space. By analyzing the entanglement spectra, one can distinguish between scarred and thermal states and gain insight into the nature of the non-ergodic dynamics [3; 4].

Despite these advances, several challenges remain, including the efficient handling of large-scale systems and the accurate representation of long-range entanglement in higher dimensions. Future work will likely focus on extending tensor network methods to higher dimensions and incorporating more sophisticated ansätze that can capture the complex entanglement structures of fragmented systems. These developments will be crucial for furthering our understanding of quantum many-body scars and their implications for non-ergodic quantum dynamics.

## 3 Mechanisms of Hilbert Space Fragmentation

### 3.1 Symmetry-Induced Hilbert Space Fragmentation

Symmetry-induced Hilbert space fragmentation arises from the interplay between conserved quantities, global and local symmetries, and integrability conditions, which partition the Hilbert space into dynamically disconnected subspaces. This phenomenon is central to understanding the emergence of non-ergodic, long-lived states in quantum many-body systems, as it stabilizes states that resist thermalization and retain memory of initial conditions. The key mechanism involves the existence of conserved charges, which restrict the system's evolution to invariant subspaces, effectively fragmenting the full Hilbert space into smaller, decoupled sectors [1]. These conserved quantities arise naturally from symmetries of the Hamiltonian, such as translational, rotational, or internal symmetries, and are often associated with integrable models where an extensive number of conserved observables exist [9]. In such cases, the presence of these conserved charges leads to a breakdown of ergodicity, as the system's dynamics are confined to subspaces where these charges are fixed.

The role of symmetry in inducing fragmentation is particularly evident in systems with multiple conserved quantities. For instance, in spin chains with SU(2) symmetry, the total spin is conserved, leading to a decomposition of the Hilbert space into sectors with definite spin quantum numbers. Similarly, in systems with spatial symmetries, such as translational invariance, the momentum is conserved, resulting in a fragmentation of the Hilbert space into momentum sectors [3]. These symmetry-protected subspaces are not only dynamically isolated but also exhibit distinct dynamical behavior, such as different relaxation times or entanglement growth rates. Moreover, the presence of conserved quantities allows for the formation of symmetry-protected non-thermal states, which are robust against perturbations that preserve the underlying symmetries [1].

Symmetry-breaking mechanisms can also contribute to Hilbert space fragmentation by creating effective potentials that further partition the state space. In systems where symmetries are spontaneously broken, such as in magnetically ordered phases, the resulting ground state manifold can be viewed as a fragmented subspace of the full Hilbert space [1]. Similarly, in systems with discrete symmetries, such as parity or time-reversal, the existence of symmetry-protected edge states or topological defects can lead to the emergence of dynamically disconnected subspaces [1]. These effects are particularly pronounced in systems with topological order, where the Hilbert space is fragmented into topologically distinct sectors that are separated by energy gaps [1].

The impact of symmetry-induced fragmentation extends beyond the characterization of non-ergodic states, influencing the overall dynamics of the system. For instance, fragmented Hilbert spaces can lead to the emergence of long-lived coherent oscillations, as the system remains trapped within a specific subspace. Additionally, the presence of conserved quantities can suppress thermalization, resulting in the persistence of non-thermal steady states even in the absence of disorder [1]. Future research in this area could explore the interplay between symmetry-induced fragmentation and other mechanisms, such as disorder or interaction-driven fragmentation, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of Hilbert space structure in many-body quantum systems.

### 3.2 Disorder-Driven Hilbert Space Fragmentation

Disorder-driven Hilbert space fragmentation is a critical mechanism through which quantum systems can develop dynamically disconnected subspaces, leading to non-thermal steady states and the suppression of ergodicity. This phenomenon arises from the interplay between disorder, localization, and the breaking of translational invariance, which collectively alter the structure of the Hilbert space by inducing regions where quantum states cannot efficiently mix or thermalize. In such systems, disorder can localize particles or excitations, thereby preventing the typical delocalization that characterizes thermalization in extended systems. This localization effect is closely related to many-body localization (MBL), although the fragmentation of the Hilbert space due to disorder extends beyond the scope of MBL, encompassing a broader class of non-ergodic behaviors.

The role of disorder in creating fragmented Hilbert spaces has been extensively studied in models such as the disordered Ising model [1], where random potentials lead to the formation of non-thermal subspaces. These subspaces are characterized by the persistence of local conserved quantities, which restrict the system's evolution to specific regions of the Hilbert space. In such cases, the system does not explore the full state space, resulting in the formation of non-thermal steady states. The suppression of thermalization is further enhanced by the presence of inhomogeneous interactions, which introduce spatial variations in the coupling strengths between particles. These interactions can lead to the emergence of localized scar states, which are not only resistant to thermalization but also exhibit long-lived coherence [1].

One of the defining features of disorder-driven fragmentation is the dynamical localization of quantum states. Unlike traditional Anderson localization, which occurs in non-interacting systems, dynamical localization in many-body systems can persist even in the presence of interactions due to the interplay between disorder and correlations. This effect has been observed in models of strongly disordered spin chains, where the presence of random fields leads to the formation of protected subspaces [1]. These subspaces are not only dynamically stable but also exhibit reduced entanglement growth, as the system remains confined to regions of the Hilbert space that are not fully connected by the Hamiltonian's dynamics.

The connection between disorder-driven fragmentation and the breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is another important aspect. In systems where the Hilbert space is fragmented, ETH fails because the eigenstates no longer exhibit the typical thermal distribution of energy levels or the uniformity of matrix elements. Instead, they display anomalous spectral properties, such as non-uniform level spacing and localized wavefunctions, which indicate the presence of non-thermal subspaces [1]. These observations have been corroborated by numerical simulations of disordered systems, where the presence of disorder leads to the emergence of long-lived, non-thermal states that resist equilibration [1].

Despite significant progress, several challenges remain in understanding the full implications of disorder-driven Hilbert space fragmentation. One of the key open questions is how the interplay between disorder and interactions influences the stability of fragmented subspaces. Additionally, the role of disorder in the context of quantum information processing and the design of robust quantum memory remains an active area of research. Future work will need to explore the connection between disorder-driven fragmentation and other non-ergodic phenomena, such as quantum scars, and to develop more efficient numerical and analytical tools to characterize these complex quantum systems.

### 3.3 Interaction-Driven Hilbert Space Fragmentation

Interaction-driven Hilbert space fragmentation arises from the interplay of strong particle interactions, which can significantly alter the structure of quantum state spaces. Unlike symmetry-induced or disorder-driven fragmentation, this mechanism emerges from the nonlinear couplings between particles, leading to the formation of dynamically disconnected subspaces that resist thermalization. These interactions can create complex many-body states with non-ergodic behavior, effectively fragmenting the Hilbert space into regions that evolve independently under the system’s dynamics [1].

The role of strong interactions in inducing fragmentation is well documented in models such as the Ising model with random fields [1] and the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model [1]. In these systems, interactions between particles can generate conserved quantities or effective constraints that prevent the system from exploring the full Hilbert space. For example, in strongly interacting systems, the emergence of correlated subspaces can stabilize non-thermal states, preventing the system from thermalizing even in the absence of integrability or symmetry [1]. These subspaces are often characterized by long-lived coherence and localized correlations, which distinguish them from typical thermal states.

A key feature of interaction-driven fragmentation is its ability to support non-ergodic dynamics even in the presence of strong coupling. This has been demonstrated in the context of the Pfaffian states, where interactions give rise to topologically protected subspaces that remain isolated from the rest of the Hilbert space [1]. The resulting fragmentation is not merely a consequence of conservation laws, but rather a direct outcome of the interaction-induced correlations that suppress the spread of quantum information across the entire space. This is in contrast to the disorder-driven fragmentation, where localization effects dominate, and the interactions are secondary in determining the structure of the fragmented space.

One of the challenges in studying interaction-driven fragmentation lies in understanding how the interplay between interaction strength, range, and system size determines the extent of fragmentation. Recent studies have explored the role of power-law interactions in driving the emergence of long-range correlations and non-ergodic behavior [2]. These findings suggest that the criticality of the interaction range can significantly influence the stability of fragmented subspaces and the efficiency of quantum information processing in such systems.

From a practical standpoint, interaction-driven fragmentation has profound implications for quantum computing and information processing. The existence of non-thermal, long-lived states in strongly interacting systems opens new avenues for constructing robust quantum memory and error-correcting codes. Moreover, the ability to control and manipulate these fragmented subspaces could lead to novel strategies for simulating complex many-body systems [3].

In conclusion, interaction-driven Hilbert space fragmentation is a critical mechanism that underpins the non-ergodic behavior observed in many quantum systems. By understanding the interplay between interactions and Hilbert space structure, we gain deeper insights into the nature of quantum dynamics and the potential for developing new quantum technologies. Future research should focus on characterizing the universal properties of these fragmented subspaces and exploring their applications in both theoretical and experimental quantum physics.

### 3.4 Topological Constraints and Hilbert Space Fragmentation

The role of topological constraints in the fragmentation of Hilbert space is a fascinating and rapidly developing area of research, offering profound insights into the interplay between geometry, topology, and quantum dynamics. Topological constraints, which may arise from the spatial arrangement of the system or the presence of topological defects, can significantly influence the structure of the Hilbert space by creating dynamically disconnected subspaces. These subspaces are often associated with non-ergodic behavior, where quantum states are protected from thermalization due to the presence of topological invariants [1]. Such protection is crucial for maintaining long-lived, coherent quantum states, which are essential for applications in quantum information processing and quantum computing.

Topological constraints can manifest in various ways, depending on the system under consideration. For example, in lattice models, the geometry of the lattice can impose restrictions on the possible configurations of the quantum states, leading to the formation of fragmented subspaces. Similarly, the presence of topological defects such as vortices or domain walls can create localized regions where the quantum states exhibit distinct dynamical properties [1]. These defects act as bottlenecks, preventing the system from exploring the entire Hilbert space and thereby fostering the emergence of non-ergodic subspaces. In such cases, the topological protection of quantum states is closely tied to the conservation of certain topological charges, which remain invariant under local perturbations [1].

The mechanism by which topological constraints lead to Hilbert space fragmentation can be understood through the lens of topological order. Topological order, characterized by the existence of long-range entanglement and robust ground state degeneracy, provides a natural framework for studying the effects of topological constraints on quantum dynamics. In systems with topological order, the Hilbert space can be partitioned into sectors that are disconnected from each other due to the non-trivial topology of the system. These sectors are often associated with distinct topological phases, each of which supports its own set of non-ergodic states [1]. The fragmentation of the Hilbert space in such systems is not merely a consequence of the topology itself but is also influenced by the interactions between the quantum states and the topological defects.

From a practical perspective, the study of topological constraints and their impact on Hilbert space fragmentation has significant implications for the design of quantum devices. The ability to protect quantum states from thermalization and decoherence is a key challenge in quantum computing, and topological constraints offer a promising avenue for achieving this protection. By leveraging the robustness of topological states, researchers can develop quantum systems that are resilient to errors and capable of maintaining coherence over extended periods. This has led to the exploration of topologically protected qubits and the development of fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures [1].

Looking ahead, the study of topological constraints and Hilbert space fragmentation is expected to yield further insights into the fundamental nature of quantum dynamics. Emerging trends in the field include the investigation of higher-dimensional topological systems and the exploration of novel topological phases that may support more complex forms of non-ergodic behavior. Additionally, the integration of machine learning techniques with topological methods is opening new avenues for the discovery and characterization of topologically protected states [2]. As the field continues to evolve, the interplay between topology, geometry, and quantum dynamics will remain a central theme, driving the development of new theoretical frameworks and experimental platforms.

### 3.5 Dynamical Implications of Hilbert Space Fragmentation

The dynamical implications of Hilbert space fragmentation represent a profound shift in our understanding of quantum many-body systems, as they fundamentally alter the landscape of thermalization, relaxation, and the emergence of non-thermal steady states. When the Hilbert space is fragmented into dynamically disconnected subspaces, the system's evolution becomes confined to these subspaces, preventing the typical ergodic behavior expected in generic quantum systems. This fragmentation leads to the persistence of non-thermal, long-lived states that resist the onset of thermalization, thereby challenging the assumptions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) [1]. These non-ergodic states are characterized by their ability to retain memory of initial conditions and exhibit slow relaxation dynamics, often governed by conserved quantities or symmetry-protected structures within the fragmented subspaces [10].

One of the most striking dynamical consequences of Hilbert space fragmentation is the suppression of thermalization. In systems with fragmented Hilbert spaces, the absence of ergodicity implies that the system does not explore the entire Hilbert space during its evolution. Instead, it remains localized within specific subspaces, which can be identified by their conserved charges or symmetry properties. This results in the formation of long-lived, non-thermal states that do not equilibrate to the expected thermal ensemble. These states can exhibit robust quantum coherence and non-ergodic dynamics even in the presence of interactions and disorder, offering a new pathway to the stabilization of quantum information [1; 10].

Furthermore, the fragmentation of Hilbert space facilitates the emergence of non-thermal steady states, which are distinct from the typical thermalized states found in ergodic systems. These non-thermal states are often associated with conserved quantities and can be dynamically stable, even in the presence of perturbations. The existence of such states has significant implications for the design of quantum memory and error correction schemes, as they provide a mechanism for preserving quantum coherence over extended periods [3; 11]. The interplay between fragmentation and the dynamics of entanglement is also of critical importance, as the structure of the fragmented Hilbert space can influence the growth and distribution of entanglement in complex many-body systems [1].

From a computational perspective, the dynamical implications of Hilbert space fragmentation necessitate a rethinking of the methods used to simulate and analyze quantum systems. Traditional approaches based on the ETH and standard thermalization models may fail to capture the rich non-ergodic behavior exhibited by fragmented systems. New numerical techniques, such as tensor network methods and efficient contraction algorithms, are essential for studying the long-time dynamics and non-thermal steady states that emerge in these systems [1; 1]. Future research should focus on developing a deeper understanding of the interplay between fragmentation, symmetry, and quantum coherence, as well as exploring the potential of non-thermal states for practical quantum information processing tasks [12].

## 4 Characterization and Identification of Quantum Many-Body Scars

### 4.1 Criteria for Identifying Quantum Many-Body Scars

Quantum many-body scars are non-thermal, long-lived excited states that exhibit anomalous dynamical behavior, distinct from the typical ergodic behavior of quantum systems. Identifying these scars requires a careful analysis of their unique dynamical and spectral properties, which set them apart from thermalized states. The criteria for identifying quantum many-body scars encompass both theoretical and empirical approaches, relying on the interplay of symmetry, conservation laws, and the structure of the Hilbert space.

One of the primary criteria is the observation of long-lived excited states with minimal decay rates, often persisting for extended periods under time evolution [1]. These states do not thermalize quickly and retain memory of their initial conditions, which is a hallmark of non-ergodic dynamics. This can be quantified through the study of relaxation dynamics, where the deviation from the expected thermalization behavior is measured using quantities such as the return probability or the Loschmidt echo [1]. In particular, the presence of scars is often signaled by a significant suppression of the decay rate compared to typical thermal states, as demonstrated in studies of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model [1].

Another essential criterion is the deviation from thermalization, as evidenced by non-ergodic behavior and the persistence of initial state characteristics. This is often observed in the time evolution of observables, where the expectation values of certain operators remain close to their initial values over long timescales [1]. Such behavior is typically not observed in systems that thermalize, and it suggests the presence of conserved quantities or symmetries that protect these states from equilibration. The interplay between symmetry and non-thermal dynamics is a critical aspect of scar identification, as many-body scars often arise in systems with conserved charges or integrable structures [1].

Spectral analysis is another key method for identifying quantum many-body scars. These states are characterized by non-uniform level spacing and non-Gaussian energy distributions, which contrast with the Wigner-Dyson statistics typically observed in chaotic systems [1]. The presence of sharp peaks or anomalies in the density of states can also serve as a signature of scarred states, indicating the existence of localized or quasi-localized eigenstates. These spectral features can be analyzed using techniques such as the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution (NNSD) and the level curvature, which provide insights into the degree of chaos or integrability in the system [1].

Finally, the structural features of scarred states, such as localized wavefunctions or enhanced correlations in certain regions of the Hilbert space, offer additional criteria for their identification. These features can be detected using methods such as entanglement entropy, which reveals the presence of non-ergodic subspaces, and by analyzing the spatial structure of the eigenstates using numerical techniques such as exact diagonalization and tensor network methods [1; 1]. The combination of these criteria provides a robust framework for identifying quantum many-body scars, enabling a deeper understanding of their role in non-ergodic quantum dynamics and the broader implications for quantum information and condensed matter physics.

### 4.2 Spectral Analysis of Scarred States

The spectral analysis of quantum many-body scarred states is a critical component in their characterization, offering insights into their unique properties that distinguish them from typical thermal states. Unlike the eigenvalue distributions of chaotic or thermal systems, which often conform to random matrix theory (RMT) predictions, scarred states exhibit distinctive spectral features that reflect their non-ergodic nature and enhanced stability. These features include deviations in nearest-neighbor level spacing distributions, anomalous density of states, and the emergence of sharp spectral peaks or valleys, which can be attributed to the localization of eigenstates in specific regions of the Hilbert space [1; 1]. Such spectral signatures are particularly pronounced in systems with conserved quantities, where scars arise due to the interplay between integrability and symmetry [1].

One of the key approaches to spectral analysis involves the study of level statistics, particularly the distribution of spacings between adjacent energy levels. In chaotic systems, these spacings follow the Wigner-Dyson distribution, indicative of strong level repulsion and delocalized eigenstates. In contrast, scarred states often show a broader distribution, with a higher probability of small spacing and a reduced degree of level repulsion. This deviation is a direct consequence of the reduced dimensionality of the subspace occupied by the scarred states, leading to a more pronounced correlation between eigenstates [1]. Furthermore, the presence of conserved quantities or symmetries can lead to the formation of regular spectral structures, such as those seen in integrable systems, which can be further analyzed using tools from quantum chaos and spectral graph theory [1; 2].

Another important aspect of spectral analysis is the investigation of the density of states (DOS) and its dependence on the system's parameters. In systems exhibiting Hilbert space fragmentation, the DOS often displays sharp features, such as peaks or dips, that are not observed in typical thermal systems. These features can be interpreted as signatures of localized or quasi-localized eigenstates, which are characteristic of scarred states [3; 1]. The use of spectral measures, such as the inverse participation ratio (IPR), provides a quantitative way to assess the degree of localization of eigenstates, with higher IPR values indicating stronger localization [3].

Recent advances in numerical techniques, including machine learning and tensor network methods, have enabled more precise and efficient spectral analysis of scarred states. These methods allow for the extraction of spectral properties from large-scale quantum systems and provide new avenues for identifying and characterizing non-ergodic behavior [4; 13]. Additionally, the interplay between spectral analysis and dynamical signatures, such as the persistence of coherence and the presence of long-lived oscillations, offers a powerful framework for understanding the complex behavior of scarred states in both isolated and driven systems [3]. Future directions in this field include the development of more refined spectral tools and the integration of experimental measurements to validate theoretical predictions.

### 4.3 Numerical Techniques for Scar Detection

Numerical techniques play a crucial role in the detection and analysis of quantum many-body scars, offering a way to probe the non-thermal and long-lived nature of these states in complex quantum systems. Traditional methods such as exact diagonalization (ED) have been instrumental in identifying scarred eigenstates by directly computing the spectrum of small to medium-sized systems. ED provides a clear view of the energy level statistics, revealing deviations from random matrix theory, such as non-uniform level spacing and sharp peaks in the density of states, which are hallmarks of scarred states [1; 1]. However, the computational cost of ED grows exponentially with system size, limiting its applicability to larger systems. To overcome this, tensor network methods, particularly time-evolving block decimation (TEBD), have emerged as powerful tools for studying the dynamics of scarred states in larger systems. TEBD enables the simulation of time evolution with a controlled truncation of the entanglement, allowing for the efficient representation of many-body wave functions and the tracking of non-thermal coherence over extended periods [1; 1]. These methods have been successfully applied to models such as the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, where scarred states manifest as persistent oscillations in the magnetization [2]. In addition to traditional approaches, modern computational techniques, such as machine learning and data-driven algorithms, have begun to transform the landscape of scar detection. Neural networks and pattern recognition techniques have been employed to identify scarred states by analyzing the structure of wave functions and their dynamical behavior. For example, in studies of the Heisenberg XXZ spin chain, machine learning models have been trained to distinguish between regular and chaotic states, revealing the presence of quantum scars through their unique spectral and entanglement signatures [3]. These data-driven methods offer a promising avenue for detecting scars in large-scale systems where traditional simulations are infeasible. Furthermore, the integration of quantum simulation platforms, such as cold atoms and trapped ions, with numerical techniques has enabled the experimental validation of theoretical predictions. By combining high-fidelity control over quantum states with numerical analysis, researchers can probe the interplay between scarred states and environmental noise, providing deeper insights into their stability and dynamics [1; 3]. As the field advances, the development of hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of exact diagonalization, tensor networks, and machine learning will be essential for a comprehensive understanding of quantum many-body scars. Future research will likely focus on improving the scalability of these methods and refining their ability to distinguish scarred states from other non-thermal phenomena, paving the way for more accurate and efficient detection in complex quantum systems.

### 4.4 Experimental Techniques for Scar Observation

Experimental observation of quantum many-body scars has become a crucial frontier in the study of non-ergodic quantum dynamics. These long-lived, non-thermal states challenge the conventional picture of thermalization and have been observed in a variety of platforms, each offering unique advantages and limitations. Cold atom systems, trapped ions, and photonic lattices have emerged as leading experimental platforms, each with distinct capabilities for engineering and probing scarred states. In cold atom systems, the ability to tune interactions and external potentials with high precision allows for the direct engineering of scarred eigenstates [1]. By applying tailored laser fields and magnetic gradients, researchers have observed the persistence of non-thermal states over extended timescales, often attributed to the presence of conserved quantities or symmetry protection [1]. Trapped ion experiments, on the other hand, provide exceptional control over individual quantum systems, enabling high-fidelity measurements of scar dynamics and the identification of scarred states through state tomography and entanglement characterization [1]. The long coherence times of trapped ions make them particularly well-suited for studying the stability of scars under various perturbations. Photonic systems, including integrated waveguide arrays and superconducting circuits, offer an alternative route by simulating quantum many-body Hamiltonians with high controllability and scalability [1]. In these systems, the dynamics of scarred states can be probed via time-resolved spectroscopy and quantum state reconstruction, revealing their unique spectral and temporal signatures. Advanced spectroscopic techniques, such as Ramsey interferometry and pump-probe spectroscopy, have been instrumental in identifying the presence of scars by detecting non-ergodic behavior in the time evolution of quantum states [1]. Additionally, quantum tomography and machine learning-based state reconstruction have played a critical role in characterizing the structure of scarred states, particularly in large-scale systems where traditional methods become infeasible [2]. These techniques allow for the extraction of key features such as entanglement entropy, correlation functions, and energy level statistics, which distinguish scarred states from typical thermal states. The interplay between experimental platforms and numerical simulations has further enhanced the understanding of scarred states, enabling the validation of theoretical predictions and the refinement of measurement protocols. For instance, the use of tensor network methods in conjunction with experimental data has provided insights into the structure of fragmented Hilbert spaces and the role of symmetries in stabilizing scars [3]. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in the reliable detection and characterization of scarred states, particularly in the presence of noise and experimental imperfections. Future developments in quantum control, error mitigation, and data analysis techniques will be essential for advancing the experimental study of quantum many-body scars. As these experimental techniques continue to evolve, they will play a pivotal role in uncovering the fundamental properties of non-ergodic quantum systems and their implications for quantum information processing and quantum simulation.

## 5 Implications for Quantum Dynamics and Information Processing

### 5.1 Quantum Coherence Preservation and Thermalization Suppression

Quantum many-body scars offer a unique pathway to preserving quantum coherence and suppressing thermalization in isolated quantum systems, challenging the conventional wisdom of ergodicity and thermalization. These non-thermal, long-lived excited states, often found in systems with conserved quantities or symmetry, resist the typical equilibration processes that govern generic quantum systems. Their existence and stability are deeply tied to the interplay between symmetry, conservation laws, and the structure of the Hilbert space, leading to the emergence of dynamically invariant subspaces [13]. These subspaces, characterized by fragmented Hilbert space, prevent the system from fully exploring the entire state space, thereby maintaining coherence over extended time scales.

One of the key mechanisms by which quantum scars suppress thermalization is through their spectral properties. Unlike typical thermal states, which exhibit random matrix statistics such as Wigner-Dyson level spacing distributions, scarred states often display non-uniform level spacing and non-Gaussian energy distributions [4]. This deviation from typical thermal behavior suggests that the system does not fully thermalize, but instead remains in a non-equilibrium state that preserves coherence. The persistence of such states can be understood through the lens of symmetry and integrability, where conserved quantities act as a stabilizing force, protecting the system from decoherence and ensuring long-lived correlations [3].

In the context of quantum information processing, the preservation of coherence in scarred states has significant implications. Quantum systems that can maintain coherence for extended periods are crucial for tasks such as quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum error correction. The long-lived nature of scars, combined with their resistance to thermalization, suggests that they could be harnessed as stable quantum memory or as a resource for quantum information protocols. Recent studies have demonstrated that quantum scars can be used to encode and protect quantum information against environmental noise, leveraging the symmetry and conservation laws that underpin their stability [1].

Moreover, the suppression of thermalization in systems with scars opens new avenues for studying non-ergodic dynamics and exploring the boundaries of quantum equilibration. By isolating subspaces where thermalization is suppressed, researchers can investigate the role of symmetry and conservation in maintaining non-thermal behavior. This has led to the development of novel experimental and numerical techniques, such as quantum simulation and machine learning, to detect and characterize scarred states [1; 2].

Despite these advances, several challenges remain. The precise conditions under which scars emerge and persist, as well as their robustness against perturbations and noise, are still not fully understood. Additionally, the practical implementation of scarred states in quantum information processing tasks requires further investigation. Future work will need to address these issues, as well as explore the potential of scars in more complex and realistic quantum systems, paving the way for new breakthroughs in quantum dynamics and information processing.

### 5.2 Entanglement Dynamics and Quantum Correlation Evolution

The evolution of entanglement and quantum correlations in many-body systems is profoundly influenced by the structure of the Hilbert space, particularly when fragmentation occurs. Hilbert space fragmentation, which partitions the state space into dynamically disconnected subspaces, fundamentally alters the way entanglement is generated, sustained, and dissipated. In systems with fragmented Hilbert spaces, the dynamics are constrained to subspaces that may exhibit distinct entanglement properties compared to the full Hilbert space. This has significant implications for the behavior of quantum correlations, as the system’s evolution is restricted to regions where certain symmetries or conservation laws are preserved, thereby modifying the typical entanglement growth mechanisms seen in ergodic systems [1; 1].

Entanglement dynamics in fragmented systems are often characterized by slower growth rates and the emergence of non-thermal entanglement patterns. For instance, in systems where conserved quantities or symmetries lead to the formation of scarred states, entanglement can be suppressed or exhibit non-monotonic behavior. These effects are consistent with observations in many-body localized systems, where the interplay between disorder and interactions leads to the formation of non-ergodic subspaces that resist thermalization [1; 1]. Moreover, the presence of fragmented subspaces can result in long-lived correlations that do not decay as expected in thermal systems, highlighting the importance of symmetry and conservation laws in shaping the entanglement landscape [2; 3].

The interplay between fragmented subspaces and quantum correlation evolution is further complicated by the presence of local conservation laws and topological constraints. In systems with such constraints, the entanglement structure is often highly non-uniform, with correlations predominantly confined to certain regions of the Hilbert space [1; 3]. This has implications for the design of quantum information processing tasks, where the ability to control and manipulate entangled states is crucial. For example, in quantum simulations, the fragmentation of the Hilbert space can be leveraged to simulate complex many-body systems with reduced computational overhead, as the evolution remains restricted to a subset of the full state space [4; 13].

One of the key challenges in this area is the development of efficient numerical and analytical tools to characterize the entanglement structure in fragmented systems. Techniques such as tensor network methods and entanglement entropy analysis have proven useful in capturing the evolution of quantum correlations, but they face limitations when applied to large-scale systems with complex fragmentation patterns [3; 12]. Future work will need to focus on refining these methods and exploring novel approaches that can handle the unique features of fragmented Hilbert spaces.

In summary, the study of entanglement dynamics and quantum correlation evolution in the presence of Hilbert space fragmentation is an emerging frontier in quantum many-body physics. The unique properties of fragmented systems offer new opportunities for understanding the interplay between quantum coherence, entanglement, and non-ergodic dynamics, while also presenting significant challenges in both theoretical and computational domains.

### 5.3 Quantum Error Correction and Robust Quantum Memory

Quantum many-body scars offer a novel and intriguing pathway for quantum error correction and the design of robust quantum memory systems. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on stabilizer codes or topological protection, scars provide a means of encoding information in non-thermal, long-lived states that resist the typical mechanisms of decoherence. These states, characterized by their persistence in the absence of thermalization, are stabilized by symmetries and conservation laws that prevent them from relaxing to equilibrium [1]. This natural robustness makes them a promising candidate for protecting quantum information in the presence of environmental noise.

The non-thermal nature of scars implies that they occupy dynamically invariant subspaces of the Hilbert space, which are effectively disconnected from the thermalizing bulk. This fragmentation of the Hilbert space, as discussed in earlier sections, is key to their stability. In the context of quantum error correction, this suggests that scarred states could be used as logical qubits, where the encoded information is preserved within the scarred subspace. The robustness of these states against environmental perturbations arises from the fact that they are not easily accessible through local operations, thus preventing the propagation of errors [1]. This property is reminiscent of the idea of quantum memory protected by symmetry, but with the added benefit of long-lived coherence due to the non-ergodic dynamics of the scarred states.

Several recent studies have explored the potential of scars for quantum error correction. For instance, the work of [1] demonstrated that scarred states can be used to construct error-correcting codes that are resilient to both local and global noise. By leveraging the structure of the scarred subspace, they showed that the logical qubits encoded in these states exhibit enhanced coherence times compared to conventional qubits. Similarly, [1] explored the use of scarred eigenstates in the context of fault-tolerant quantum computing, showing that the non-thermal properties of scars can be harnessed to reduce the overhead required for error correction.

However, the application of scars to quantum error correction is not without challenges. One major limitation is the sensitivity of scarred states to perturbations that break the underlying symmetries. While scars are robust in the presence of certain conserved quantities, the introduction of noise or disorder can lead to their destabilization [1]. Furthermore, the complexity of controlling and manipulating scarred states in experimental settings remains a significant hurdle. Despite these challenges, the unique properties of scars—particularly their long lifetime and resistance to thermalization—make them a compelling area of research for the development of robust quantum memory systems.

In summary, quantum many-body scars present a novel and promising approach to quantum error correction and quantum memory. Their non-thermal, long-lived nature, combined with the structure of fragmented Hilbert spaces, offers a new paradigm for protecting quantum information. Future research should focus on improving the stability of scarred states under realistic noise conditions and exploring their integration with existing error correction protocols. As the field of quantum many-body scars continues to evolve, it is likely to provide valuable insights into the design of fault-tolerant quantum systems.

### 5.4 Quantum Simulation and Complex Many-Body System Studies

Quantum simulation and the study of complex many-body systems represent one of the most promising frontiers for quantum technologies, particularly when leveraging the unique properties of quantum scarred states. These non-thermal, long-lived eigenstates, which arise from symmetry, integrability, or disorder, provide a powerful resource for simulating systems that are intractable for classical computers. By encoding the dynamics of complex quantum systems into scarred states, researchers can probe non-ergodic behavior, entanglement dynamics, and the emergence of exotic phases of matter. This subsection examines how quantum scars are being harnessed for quantum simulation, highlighting their role in advancing our understanding of many-body physics.

One of the key advantages of scarred states is their ability to maintain coherence and resist thermalization, which is crucial for preserving quantum information during simulations. This property is particularly valuable in studying non-ergodic dynamics, where traditional thermalization mechanisms fail. For instance, quantum scars have been shown to exhibit non-thermal spectral properties and long-lived correlations, which can be exploited to model systems with fragmented Hilbert spaces [1]. In such cases, the presence of conserved quantities or topological constraints ensures the stability of scarred states, enabling accurate long-time simulations of otherwise intractable systems [1].

The utility of quantum scars in quantum simulation extends beyond static properties, as they also offer insights into the dynamics of many-body systems. For example, in the context of the SYK model and other strongly correlated systems, scarred states have been used to study the growth of entanglement and the breakdown of thermalization. These studies reveal how the interplay between local interactions, symmetry, and disorder can lead to the formation of non-thermal steady states with unique dynamical features [2]. Moreover, the presence of quantum scars can provide a pathway to simulate systems with slow relaxation, such as those found in quantum spin glasses or systems with long-range interactions [3].

From a computational perspective, quantum scarred states offer a means to reduce the effective complexity of many-body simulations. By focusing on dynamically invariant subspaces, it becomes possible to simulate large-scale systems with reduced computational resources. This is particularly relevant in the context of tensor network methods, where the structure of scarred states can be exploited to efficiently represent entangled many-body states [1; 3]. Recent advances in quantum machine learning further support this approach, as neural networks can be trained to recognize and generate scarred states, enabling more efficient exploration of the Hilbert space [4].

Looking ahead, the integration of quantum scars into quantum simulation frameworks presents both challenges and opportunities. While the robustness of scarred states makes them attractive for long-time simulations, their non-ergodic nature also requires careful characterization and validation. Future work may focus on developing scalable algorithms that leverage scarred states for quantum advantage, particularly in applications involving strongly correlated systems, topological phases, and quantum information processing. As experimental platforms such as cold atoms and trapped ions continue to improve, the ability to engineer and control scarred states will play a critical role in realizing the full potential of quantum simulation.

## 6 Experimental Observations and Simulations

### 6.1 Experimental Platforms for Observing Quantum Many-Body Scars

The experimental observation of quantum many-body scars has been a cornerstone in validating the theoretical predictions and understanding the non-thermal dynamics of quantum systems. Among the various experimental platforms, cold atom systems, trapped ions, and photonic lattices have emerged as the most promising approaches for probing these non-thermal, long-lived excited states. Each platform offers distinct advantages and challenges, making them complementary in the broader landscape of quantum simulation and control.

Cold atom systems, particularly those in optical lattices, provide a highly tunable and controllable environment for studying quantum many-body phenomena [12]. By adjusting the lattice depth, interaction strength, and external potentials, researchers can engineer the Hamiltonian of the system to simulate a wide range of quantum models. The ability to realize and manipulate strongly correlated systems has enabled the observation of scarred eigenstates in systems such as the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and the Ising model with transverse fields. Moreover, the high degree of control over parameters like disorder and interaction strength makes cold atoms ideal for studying the conditions under which Hilbert space fragmentation occurs. However, the challenge lies in achieving the necessary precision to observe and distinguish non-thermal states from thermalized ones, especially in larger systems [1].

Trapped ion systems, on the other hand, offer high-fidelity control and long coherence times, making them particularly well-suited for studying the dynamics of quantum scars. The ability to prepare and manipulate individual quantum states with high fidelity, combined with the scalability of ion-trap architectures, allows for precise measurements of the lifetime and coherence of scarred states. These systems have been used to observe the persistence of non-thermal states in spin systems, demonstrating the robustness of scars against thermalization. The high degree of controllability also enables the implementation of tailored Hamiltonians, allowing for the exploration of scar formation in systems with specific symmetries and conserved quantities [1]. However, the challenge in trapped ion platforms is the scalability of the system, as the number of ions that can be simultaneously controlled is limited by the available trap and detection capabilities.

Photonic lattices, utilizing arrays of coupled optical waveguides, offer a unique platform for simulating quantum many-body dynamics in a highly controlled and scalable manner. These systems allow for the realization of complex Hamiltonian structures and the study of the propagation of quantum states through engineered lattices. The ability to dynamically reconfigure the lattice structure and apply external potentials makes photonic lattices particularly useful for studying the effects of disorder and interactions on the formation of scars. Additionally, the non-interacting nature of photons in many implementations allows for the study of scarred states in systems without the complications of strong interactions. However, the lack of intrinsic interactions and the difficulty in achieving strong coupling between photons pose challenges in simulating more complex many-body systems [1].

In conclusion, each of these experimental platforms contributes uniquely to the investigation of quantum many-body scars. Cold atoms offer unparalleled control over system parameters, trapped ions provide high-fidelity measurements, and photonic lattices enable scalable and reconfigurable simulations. The continued development of these platforms, along with the integration of advanced measurement techniques and machine learning algorithms, will be essential in overcoming the challenges of detecting and characterizing quantum scars in increasingly complex systems.

### 6.2 Numerical Simulations and Theoretical Predictions

Numerical simulations have played a pivotal role in predicting and understanding the complex behavior of quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation. These phenomena, characterized by non-ergodic dynamics and the formation of dynamically disconnected subspaces, have been extensively studied using a variety of computational techniques, including exact diagonalization, tensor networks, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Each of these approaches offers unique advantages and limitations in capturing the intricate interplay between symmetries, conservation laws, and non-thermal states.

Exact diagonalization, while limited in system size due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, has been instrumental in identifying scarred eigenstates by analyzing their spectral properties and relaxation dynamics [3]. This method is particularly effective for small to medium-sized systems, where it can directly reveal the presence of non-thermal states and their deviation from thermalization. However, its applicability is constrained by the computational resources required, making it less suitable for large-scale systems where many-body effects dominate.

Tensor network methods, such as matrix product states (MPS) and projected entangled pair states (PEPS), offer a more scalable approach to simulating large quantum systems. These techniques are particularly well-suited for capturing the entanglement structure of fragmented Hilbert spaces and have been successfully applied to study the dynamics of scarred states in both integrable and non-integrable systems [14]. By efficiently representing the many-body wavefunction, tensor networks enable the simulation of systems with conserved quantities and non-ergodic dynamics, providing insights into the role of entanglement in the formation of fragmented subspaces.

Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques, on the other hand, are widely used to study the thermalization processes and the emergence of non-thermal steady states in many-body systems. These methods are particularly useful for investigating the interplay between disorder, interactions, and symmetry in driving Hilbert space fragmentation [1]. While QMC methods can handle large systems and provide statistical averages over many configurations, they are often limited by the sign problem, which restricts their applicability to certain classes of Hamiltonians.

Recent advances in numerical methods, such as the development of high-order energy-preserving schemes and the use of machine learning for data-driven discovery of conserved quantities, have further enhanced the ability to simulate and analyze quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation [1; 1]. These approaches not only improve the accuracy and efficiency of numerical simulations but also offer new tools for understanding the underlying physics of non-ergodic quantum systems.

The synergy between numerical simulations and theoretical predictions has been crucial in advancing our understanding of quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation. As computational power continues to grow, the integration of more sophisticated numerical techniques with analytical frameworks will be essential in unraveling the complex dynamics of these phenomena. Future research will likely focus on developing scalable algorithms that can capture the intricate interplay between symmetry, conservation laws, and non-ergodic behavior in realistic quantum systems.

### 6.3 Challenges in Detection and Characterization

The detection and characterization of quantum many-body scars present significant challenges in both experimental and numerical settings. These challenges stem from the subtle and often fragile nature of scarred states, which are long-lived and non-thermal, but not necessarily distinguishable from typical thermal states through conventional measurements. One of the primary obstacles is the limited resolution of experimental techniques, which often fails to capture the fine details of the spectral properties of these states. For instance, in cold atom systems, while the tunability of interactions and potentials allows for precise control, the resolution of spectroscopic measurements may not be sufficient to resolve the sharp spectral features associated with scarred states [12]. Similarly, in trapped ion experiments, the high fidelity of control is advantageous, but the difficulty of maintaining coherence over extended timescales can obscure the long-lived coherence signatures of scars [14].

Another significant challenge is the presence of noise and decoherence, which can mask the signatures of quantum scars and lead to false positives or negatives in their identification. In real-world systems, environmental noise and imperfections in the Hamiltonian can introduce spurious dynamics that mimic the behavior of scars, making it difficult to discern genuine non-thermal states from artifacts. For example, in photonic lattices, the interplay between disorder and interactions can lead to complex dynamics that are challenging to disentangle from the effects of scars [10]. Moreover, the theoretical and experimental methods used to identify and characterize these states must be carefully validated to ensure that observed non-ergodic behavior is indeed due to scars and not other factors, such as imperfections in the system or external perturbations [11].

The difficulty of distinguishing scarred states from typical thermal states is further compounded by the fact that the criteria for identification are not always straightforward. While long-lived coherence and deviation from thermalization are often cited as hallmarks of scars, these features can also arise from other non-ergodic phenomena, such as many-body localization or topological protection. Therefore, the development of robust and reliable criteria for identifying scars remains an active area of research. Machine learning and data-driven techniques have shown promise in improving the accuracy of scar detection and characterization, as they can learn complex patterns in large-scale data and distinguish subtle differences between scarred and thermal states [3].

In numerical simulations, the challenges of detecting and characterizing quantum many-body scars are equally significant. Exact diagonalization techniques, while powerful for small systems, are limited in their ability to capture the entanglement structure and dynamics of larger systems. Tensor network methods, such as matrix product states, offer a more scalable approach but still face difficulties in accurately representing the complex entanglement patterns of fragmented Hilbert spaces. Additionally, the presence of noise and the computational cost of simulating large systems can further hinder the accurate identification of scarred states [1]. As a result, the development of efficient and accurate numerical algorithms remains a critical area of research, with the potential to significantly advance our understanding of quantum many-body scars and their implications for quantum dynamics and information processing.

### 6.4 Interplay Between Experiment and Theory

The interplay between experiment and theory in the study of quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation has been a driving force behind the rapid advancement of this field. Experimental platforms such as cold atom systems, trapped ions, and photonic lattices have provided direct access to the dynamics of non-thermal states, while numerical simulations have played a crucial role in interpreting these observations and refining theoretical models. This iterative process has not only validated key theoretical predictions but also revealed new phenomena that challenge existing paradigms, fostering a deeper understanding of the interplay between symmetry, disorder, and entanglement in quantum many-body systems.

One of the most significant contributions of experiments has been the direct observation of quantum scars in ultracold atomic gases. For instance, the work by [1] demonstrated how engineered potentials and tunable interactions can create long-lived, non-thermal states that persist for extended periods under time evolution, a hallmark of quantum many-body scars. These experiments have provided empirical validation of theoretical models that predict the existence of such states in systems with conserved quantities and symmetry-protected non-thermal dynamics. The ability to control and manipulate these systems has allowed for a detailed characterization of the spectral and dynamical properties of scars, shedding light on their robustness against perturbations and their role in the breakdown of ergodicity.

Numerical simulations have complemented these experimental efforts by enabling the study of large-scale systems where direct measurement is infeasible. Techniques such as exact diagonalization and tensor network methods have been instrumental in identifying the signature features of scarred states, including non-uniform level spacing and enhanced correlations in certain regions of the Hilbert space [4]. These simulations have also played a critical role in testing theoretical predictions, such as the connection between scars and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) [1]. For example, the work by [1] has shown that the presence of scars can lead to deviations from ETH, resulting in long-lived coherence and non-thermal spectral properties. This has led to a reevaluation of the assumptions underlying the ETH and has inspired new theoretical frameworks that incorporate the effects of conserved quantities and symmetry.

Moreover, the development of machine learning algorithms has further bridged the gap between experiment and theory. Techniques such as variational autoencoders and neural networks have been used to detect and classify scarred states from experimental data, as demonstrated in [1]. These methods have not only improved the accuracy of scar detection but also enabled the discovery of new types of non-thermal states that were previously overlooked. The integration of machine learning with traditional numerical techniques has also facilitated the identification of emerging patterns in the dynamics of fragmented Hilbert spaces, highlighting the potential of data-driven approaches in quantum many-body physics.

The synergy between experiment and theory has also been crucial in addressing the challenges of characterizing quantum scars in real-world systems. Issues such as noise, limited resolution, and the difficulty of distinguishing scarred states from typical thermal states have been tackled through the development of advanced measurement techniques and theoretical models that incorporate these effects. For example, the work by [1] has demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning in extracting relevant features from noisy experimental data, providing a robust framework for scar identification. This has paved the way for more accurate and reliable experimental validation of theoretical models, ensuring that the insights gained from simulations and experiments are mutually reinforcing.

Looking ahead, the continued interplay between experiment and theory will be essential for addressing remaining challenges, such as the characterization of scars in higher-dimensional systems and the exploration of their potential applications in quantum information processing. As experimental techniques improve and numerical methods become more sophisticated, the field is poised for further breakthroughs, with the potential to uncover new phenomena and deepen our understanding of non-ergodic quantum dynamics.

## 7 Interdisciplinary Connections and Broader Implications

### 7.1 Interplay Between Quantum Many-Body Scars and Many-Body Localization

The interplay between quantum many-body scars and many-body localization (MBL) represents a rich area of study at the intersection of non-ergodic quantum dynamics, disorder, and symmetry. Both phenomena are characterized by the suppression of thermalization in isolated quantum systems, yet they emerge from distinct physical mechanisms and exhibit different structural and dynamical properties. This subsection explores the shared features and contrasting mechanisms of quantum many-body scars and MBL, emphasizing their implications for the broader understanding of quantum equilibration and non-ergodicity.

Quantum many-body scars are long-lived, non-thermal eigenstates that arise in systems with special symmetries or conserved quantities, often leading to anomalous dynamics such as persistent oscillations and reduced entanglement growth [1]. These scars are not purely a consequence of disorder but rather emerge from the interplay between integrability and weak perturbations, allowing for the existence of quasi-stationary states that resist the typical thermalization expected in generic many-body systems [1]. In contrast, MBL is a disorder-driven phenomenon where strong randomness localizes the system’s eigenstates, preventing the spread of quantum information and leading to the breakdown of thermalization [1]. While both scars and MBL suppress thermalization, the former often coexists with weak interactions and integrability, whereas the latter relies on strong disorder to localize the system.

The relationship between these two phenomena is further complicated by their shared dependence on symmetry and conserved quantities. In systems with conserved charges or spatial symmetries, scars can persist even in the presence of weak interactions, whereas MBL typically requires strong disorder to maintain localization. However, recent studies have shown that in certain parameter regimes, scars and MBL can coexist or even compete, leading to a complex interplay between non-ergodic behaviors [1]. For example, in systems with both disorder and conserved quantities, the presence of scars can either enhance or suppress the MBL phase, depending on the strength of the interactions and the nature of the disorder [1].

From a theoretical standpoint, the study of quantum scars and MBL has profound implications for the understanding of quantum equilibration. Both phenomena challenge the assumptions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which posits that typical eigenstates of generic many-body systems thermalize. Scars and MBL, however, demonstrate that non-thermal states can be robust and stable, even in the absence of external perturbations [2]. This has led to renewed interest in the role of conserved quantities, symmetry, and disorder in the dynamics of quantum systems, as well as in the characterization of non-ergodic phases of matter.

Future directions in this area include the exploration of hybrid systems where scars and MBL coexist, the development of new numerical techniques to distinguish between these two phenomena, and the investigation of their potential applications in quantum information processing. As experimental advances continue to enable the realization of controlled quantum systems, the interplay between quantum many-body scars and MBL will remain a key focus for both theoretical and experimental research.

### 7.2 Quantum Scars and Coherence in Open Quantum Systems

Quantum scars, long-lived non-thermal states, have emerged as critical entities in the study of non-ergodic quantum dynamics. While their behavior in isolated systems has been extensively explored, their role in open quantum systems—where the interplay with environmental interactions introduces decoherence and dissipation—remains a rich area of investigation. The preservation of coherence in such systems is essential for quantum technologies, and recent studies have revealed that quantum scars can exhibit remarkable robustness against environmental noise, offering new pathways for quantum information processing.

In open quantum systems, the interaction with the environment typically leads to the loss of quantum coherence, a process that is often associated with the emergence of thermalized states. However, quantum scars—characterized by their non-thermal, localized nature—can resist such decoherence, maintaining coherence for extended periods. This resistance stems from the unique spectral and dynamical properties of scarred states, which often arise due to conserved quantities or symmetries. For example, studies have shown that scars can remain stable even in the presence of weak perturbations, suggesting that their robustness is rooted in the interplay between symmetry and non-ergodic dynamics [15]. This resilience makes quantum scars promising candidates for applications in quantum error correction and the development of stable quantum memory systems [16].

The mechanism behind the coherence preservation of quantum scars in open systems is closely tied to the structure of the Hilbert space and the nature of the environmental coupling. When the system-environment interaction respects certain symmetries or conservation laws, the scars may remain effectively decoupled from the environment, thereby preserving their coherence. This idea is supported by theoretical investigations into symmetry-protected non-thermal states, which demonstrate that such states can maintain their integrity even in the presence of external perturbations [17]. Moreover, the presence of fragmented Hilbert spaces—where the system's state space is partitioned into dynamically disconnected subspaces—can further enhance the stability of scarred states by limiting their exposure to the environment [18].

Experimental platforms, such as cold atom systems and trapped ions, have been instrumental in probing the coherence properties of quantum scars in open settings. These platforms allow for precise control over system parameters, enabling the observation of scarred states under controlled environmental interactions. Recent studies have demonstrated that scars can be stabilized in the presence of noise through careful engineering of the Hamiltonian, suggesting that their coherence can be actively protected [16]. This opens the door to potential applications in quantum computing and simulation, where maintaining coherence is a critical challenge.

Despite these promising developments, several challenges remain. A deeper understanding of the conditions under which scars can retain their coherence in realistic open systems is needed. Furthermore, the integration of quantum scars into practical quantum technologies will require the development of novel error correction strategies and control protocols. As the field progresses, the interplay between scars, coherence, and open system dynamics is likely to reveal new insights into the fundamental nature of quantum information and its preservation in complex environments.

### 7.3 Bridging Integrable and Chaotic Systems Through Quantum Scars

Quantum many-body scars provide a unique window into the interplay between integrable and chaotic dynamics in quantum systems, offering a bridge between the ordered behavior of integrable models and the complex, unpredictable dynamics of chaotic systems. This subsection explores how quantum scars emerge in systems with mixed classical dynamics, and how they can be used to study the transition from order to chaos in quantum mechanics. By analyzing the spectral and dynamical properties of scarred states, researchers can gain insights into the mechanisms that govern this transition and the role of non-ergodicity in quantum systems.

In integrable systems, the existence of conserved quantities ensures that the dynamics remain regular and predictable, with eigenstates typically being delocalized and thermalizing. However, in chaotic systems, the absence of such conserved quantities leads to the emergence of complex, non-ergodic behavior, where eigenstates tend to be extended and exhibit thermal properties. Quantum scars, however, represent an intermediate regime, where certain eigenstates are localized and exhibit non-thermal properties despite the overall chaotic nature of the system. These scarred states are often found near classical periodic orbits, and their presence can be used to probe the transition from integrable to chaotic behavior [1].

The study of quantum scars in mixed systems has gained significant attention due to their ability to reveal the interplay between classical and quantum dynamics. For instance, in systems where classical dynamics exhibit mixed phase space, quantum scars can serve as a signature of the underlying classical structure. This is particularly relevant in the context of quantum chaos, where the correspondence between classical and quantum dynamics is a central theme [1]. By analyzing the spectral statistics of scarred states, researchers can identify the signatures of classical chaos in the quantum realm, such as deviations from the Wigner-Dyson distribution observed in fully chaotic systems [1].

The presence of quantum scars also has important implications for the understanding of non-ergodic behavior in many-body systems. Unlike typical thermal states, scarred states exhibit long-lived coherence and can resist the onset of thermalization, even in the presence of interactions. This makes them a valuable tool for studying the breakdown of ergodicity and the emergence of non-thermal steady states in quantum systems [1]. Moreover, the ability of scars to persist in chaotic systems suggests that they may play a role in the formation of long-lived, non-ergodic subspaces that can be exploited for quantum information processing and quantum simulation [1].

From a broader perspective, the study of quantum scars offers a new approach to understanding the transition between integrable and chaotic dynamics. By examining the properties of scarred states in systems with mixed classical behavior, researchers can gain insights into the universal features of this transition and the role of non-ergodicity in quantum systems. Future work in this area could benefit from the development of new theoretical frameworks and experimental techniques that allow for the precise characterization of scarred states in a variety of quantum systems [2]. Overall, the investigation of quantum scars represents a promising avenue for bridging the gap between integrable and chaotic quantum systems, with important implications for both fundamental physics and quantum technologies.

### 7.4 Complexity and Emergent Behavior in Scarred and Fragmented Hilbert Spaces

Quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation introduce a rich framework for understanding the emergence of complexity in quantum systems. These phenomena challenge conventional notions of thermalization and ergodicity, leading to the formation of non-trivial correlations, entanglement patterns, and novel collective behaviors in many-body systems. The interplay between scars and fragmented Hilbert spaces reveals how quantum systems can exhibit non-ergodic dynamics, even in the absence of integrability or symmetry protection. This complexity arises from the structure of the Hilbert space, which is partitioned into dynamically disconnected subspaces, each supporting distinct quantum states and dynamics. These subspaces can host long-lived, non-thermal states, such as scars, which resist the typical relaxation processes observed in generic quantum systems.

One of the key features of scarred and fragmented Hilbert spaces is the emergence of robust entanglement patterns that differ from those seen in typical thermal states. Scars, for instance, often exhibit enhanced correlations in specific regions of the Hilbert space, leading to non-uniform entanglement distributions. These patterns are not merely a consequence of local interactions but are deeply tied to the global structure of the fragmented Hilbert space. Recent studies [1] have shown that such entanglement structures can be characterized using measures like the geometric squashed entanglement, which quantifies the recoverability of quantum states from their marginals. This highlights the role of scarred states in creating structured, non-thermal entanglement, which could have implications for quantum information processing and error correction [1].

The complexity induced by Hilbert space fragmentation also extends to the dynamics of quantum systems. Fragmented subspaces can lead to the formation of long-lived coherent states, which exhibit slow relaxation and memory effects. These dynamics are often associated with the suppression of thermalization, as seen in systems with conserved quantities or symmetry-protected non-thermal states [19]. Such behaviors are not only theoretically intriguing but also have practical implications for quantum simulation and control, as they suggest new ways to engineer and stabilize quantum states.

Moreover, the study of scarred and fragmented Hilbert spaces has broader implications for the understanding of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics and the emergence of complexity in quantum systems. These phenomena provide a bridge between integrable and chaotic systems, offering insights into how quantum coherence can persist in complex many-body systems. The ability to detect and manipulate these states through experimental and numerical techniques further underscores their significance in both fundamental and applied quantum science. Future research in this area could explore the interplay between scarred states and quantum computation, as well as their potential for enhancing the performance of quantum simulators and error-correcting codes [1].

## 8 Conclusion

The study of quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation has revealed profound insights into the non-ergodic behavior of quantum systems, challenging traditional assumptions about thermalization and equilibration. This survey has explored the theoretical foundations, mechanisms, and implications of these phenomena, highlighting their significance in understanding the dynamics of complex quantum systems. Quantum many-body scars, characterized by their long-lived, non-thermal properties, have been shown to arise in systems with conserved quantities, symmetries, and specific interaction patterns [20; 20]. These states defy the predictions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which posits that generic quantum states thermalize over time, and instead exhibit persistent coherence and non-thermal spectral features [20; 21].

Hilbert space fragmentation, on the other hand, refers to the partitioning of the quantum state space into dynamically disconnected subspaces, often driven by symmetries, disorder, or interactions. This fragmentation leads to the emergence of non-thermal steady states and suppresses the typical ergodic behavior of many-body systems [21; 21; 21]. The interplay between quantum scars and Hilbert space fragmentation has been shown to have significant implications for entanglement dynamics, coherence preservation, and the design of robust quantum memory [21; 21]. Furthermore, these phenomena have been linked to the emergence of complexity in quantum systems, with applications ranging from quantum information processing to the simulation of strongly correlated systems [21; 21].

Despite the progress made, several challenges remain. Theoretical frameworks for predicting and characterizing quantum scars in large-scale systems are still in their infancy, and the computational cost of simulating fragmented Hilbert spaces remains prohibitively high [21; 22]. Experimentally, detecting and distinguishing scarred states from typical thermal states remains a non-trivial task, requiring high-resolution measurements and advanced data analysis techniques [21; 23]. Moreover, the role of quantum scars in the context of quantum chaos and the transition between integrable and chaotic systems is not yet fully understood [21].

Future research should focus on developing more efficient numerical methods for simulating scarred states and fragmented Hilbert spaces, as well as exploring the potential of machine learning and data-driven techniques for their detection and characterization [21; 23; 23]. Additionally, further investigation into the interplay between quantum scars, Hilbert space fragmentation, and quantum coherence could provide new insights into the fundamental principles governing non-ergodic quantum dynamics [21; 21]. The integration of these phenomena into the broader framework of quantum information theory and complexity science holds the promise of uncovering novel quantum resources and advancing the development of next-generation quantum technologies [24; 21]. As the field continues to evolve, interdisciplinary collaboration will be essential in addressing the remaining challenges and unlocking the full potential of quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation.
