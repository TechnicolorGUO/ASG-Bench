This subsection provides a foundational overview of these materials, tracing their historical evolution, defining their classifications, and discussing their significance in addressing contemporary challenges. Nanoparticles, typically defined as particles with at least one dimension in the range of 1–100 nm, encompass a wide variety of materials, including metals, oxides, polymers, and composites [1]. Nanostructured materials, in contrast, refer to materials engineered with specific structural features at the nanoscale, such as nanotubes, nanowires, and layered architectures, which exhibit unique physical, chemical, and mechanical properties due to their size and geometry [1]. These classifications are not merely academic; they have profound implications for the design and application of nanomaterials in both biomedical and agricultural contexts.\n\nThe historical development of nanomaterials dates back to the early 20th century, with the first systematic studies of colloidal nanoparticles in the 1950s. However, it was the advent of advanced characterization techniques like scanning and transmission electron microscopy in the 1980s that truly enabled the exploration of nanostructured systems [1]. The subsequent emergence of nanotechnology as a distinct field in the 1990s marked a turning point, leading to a surge in interdisciplinary research that integrated materials science, chemistry, biology, and engineering. This interdisciplinary nature is a defining feature of nanomaterials research, as the design and application of these materials often require insights from multiple domains [1]. For instance, the development of nanostructured biosensors for early disease detection relies on principles from both materials science and molecular biology [1].\n\nThe significance of nanoparticles and nanostructured materials in biomedical engineering lies in their ability to enhance drug delivery, improve diagnostic accuracy, and enable regenerative medicine. In agricultural engineering, they offer solutions for improving crop productivity, enhancing soil health, and addressing environmental sustainability. These applications are driven by the unique properties of nanomaterials, such as high surface-to-volume ratios, tunable optical and electronic properties, and the ability to interact with biological systems at the molecular level [2]. However, the field is not without challenges. Issues related to scalability, long-term stability, and environmental and health impacts remain critical areas of research. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of advanced computational modeling, machine learning, and sustainable synthesis strategies will be essential in overcoming these challenges and unlocking the full potential of nanomaterials [3]. The next section will delve into the historical evolution and technological advancements that have shaped the development of nanomaterials in both biomedical and agricultural contexts."

Chemical synthesis methods, which leverage reaction kinetics, thermodynamics, and molecular-level interactions, have long been instrumental in producing nanomaterials with tailored compositions, sizes, and morphologies. These methods are particularly significant in biomedical and agricultural applications, where structural and functional precision is paramount. Traditional and advanced chemical approaches, including sol-gel, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrochemical techniques, and wet chemical methods, each offer unique advantages and limitations that influence their suitability for specific applications.\n\nSol-gel synthesis is a versatile route for the formation of oxide-based nanomaterials, characterized by its ability to control porosity and surface chemistry. This method involves the hydrolysis and condensation of metal alkoxides to form a gel, which is subsequently dried and calcined to produce nanomaterials. The process allows for fine-tuning of material properties through the adjustment of parameters such as pH, temperature, and precursor concentration [1]. Sol-gel synthesis is particularly effective for producing nanoceramics, thin films, and composite materials with controlled microstructures, making it valuable for applications in drug delivery, catalysis, and sensing [1].\n\nChemical vapor deposition (CVD) is another widely used technique for fabricating high-quality nanostructures, especially for carbon-based materials like carbon nanotubes and graphene. In CVD, gaseous precursors are decomposed at elevated temperatures on a substrate, leading to the deposition of nanomaterials with precise control over thickness, composition, and crystallinity. This method is renowned for its scalability and compatibility with industrial processes, although it often requires stringent temperature and pressure conditions [1]. CVD has been instrumental in the development of nanoelectronics and energy storage systems, where structural uniformity and purity are critical [1].\n\nElectrochemical techniques, including electrodeposition and electrochemical synthesis, are particularly well-suited for the fabrication of metallic and conductive nanomaterials. These methods rely on the controlled application of electrical potential to drive the deposition of materials onto a substrate. Electrochemical synthesis offers advantages such as low energy consumption and high purity, though challenges related to uniformity and scalability remain [1]. This approach is increasingly used in the development of nanosensors and electrocatalysts, where the ability to tailor surface properties is essential [2].\n\nWet chemical synthesis, encompassing methods like precipitation, solvothermal, and colloidal synthesis, provides a cost-effective and scalable route for producing nanoparticles with tunable size and surface functionalization. These techniques often involve the reduction of metal precursors in solution, allowing for the formation of nanoparticles with desired properties. Despite their simplicity, wet chemical methods can face challenges in achieving long-term stability and reproducibility [3]. Recent advances, however, have demonstrated the potential of these methods in creating nanoparticles for biomedical imaging and targeted drug delivery [1].\n\nIn summary, chemical synthesis methods offer a robust framework for the design and fabrication of nanomaterials, with each approach presenting distinct advantages and challenges. As research progresses, the integration of computational modeling and machine learning is expected to further refine these techniques, enabling even greater precision and efficiency in nanomaterial synthesis. This evolution will continue to drive innovation in both biomedical and agricultural applications, paving the way for next-generation nanosystems."

These techniques encompass a range of methods, including lithography, 3D printing, and self-assembly, each offering unique advantages in terms of resolution, complexity, and adaptability. Lithography-based techniques, such as electron beam lithography and photolithography, have long been the cornerstone of nanofabrication due to their high resolution and ability to define intricate patterns. However, these methods often require expensive equipment and complex processes, limiting their scalability [1]. In contrast, 3D printing and additive manufacturing, particularly techniques like projection microstereolithography and multi-photon lithography, provide greater flexibility in creating complex 3D nanoarchitectures, making them suitable for applications requiring bespoke geometries [1]. Despite their advantages, these methods often face challenges in achieving nanoscale resolution and maintaining structural fidelity over large areas. Self-assembly, both bottom-up and top-down, offers an alternative approach by leveraging molecular or particle interactions to form ordered nanostructures. This method is particularly advantageous for large-scale production, as it requires minimal external intervention and can be tuned through environmental conditions such as temperature and pH [1]. However, the predictability and control over the final structure remain a challenge, necessitating precise parameter tuning. Nanoimprint lithography further enhances the scalability of nanofabrication by using a physical mold to transfer patterns onto a substrate, offering high-throughput production at a lower cost compared to conventional lithography [1]. While this technique excels in replicating high-resolution patterns, it is limited by the durability and complexity of the molds used. Emerging trends in physical fabrication include the integration of computational modeling and machine learning to optimize fabrication parameters, thereby improving process control and reducing trial-and-error iterations. For instance, recent advances in autonomous robotic nanofabrication using reinforcement learning have demonstrated the potential to perform complex nanoscale tasks with high precision and reliability [1]. These developments underscore the transformative potential of physical fabrication techniques in enabling the next generation of nanostructured materials. As the demand for smaller, more functional devices grows, the continuous refinement of these methods will be crucial in addressing the challenges of precision, scalability, and cost-effectiveness in nanofabrication. Future directions may also involve the development of hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of different techniques to achieve greater versatility and performance in nanomaterial synthesis."

This subsection explores the current state of these techniques, their advantages, and their potential for industrial scalability and ecological sustainability.\n\nBio-mediated synthesis has gained attention for its ability to produce nanoparticles with controlled morphology and size while avoiding the use of toxic chemicals. For instance, plant extracts have been widely used for the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles, such as silver and gold, due to their rich phytochemical content that acts as both reducing and stabilizing agents. This method not only reduces the environmental burden associated with chemical reagents but also allows for the synthesis of nanoparticles with enhanced stability and functionality [1]. Similarly, microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi have been utilized for nanoparticle synthesis through intracellular or extracellular mechanisms. These biological systems can reduce metal ions into nanoparticles under mild conditions, often resulting in highly monodisperse and biocompatible materials [1]. The use of biomolecules, including proteins, enzymes, and polysaccharides, further expands the versatility of these approaches by enabling precise control over nanoparticle surface chemistry and functionality [1].\n\nGreen chemistry principles complement bio-inspired methods by promoting the use of non-toxic solvents, renewable feedstocks, and energy-efficient processes. For example, the use of natural polymers such as chitosan and alginate as stabilizing agents in nanoparticle synthesis reduces reliance on synthetic surfactants, thereby enhancing the biocompatibility and biodegradability of the final products [1]. Additionally, waste-to-nanomaterial strategies have been developed to repurpose industrial byproducts, such as agricultural waste or industrial sludge, as precursors for nanoparticle synthesis. These circular economy approaches not only address waste management challenges but also provide cost-effective and sustainable sources for nanomaterial production [1].\n\nDespite their advantages, bio-inspired and green synthesis methods face challenges related to scalability, reproducibility, and control over nanoparticle properties. While these techniques are often more environmentally friendly, they may require longer reaction times and may not always yield nanoparticles with the same level of uniformity as conventional methods. However, recent advances in process optimization and the integration of computational modeling have begun to address these limitations, offering new opportunities for industrial implementation.\n\nLooking ahead, the convergence of bio-inspired strategies with advanced fabrication technologies, such as 3D printing and self-assembly, holds promise for the development of next-generation nanomaterials with tailored properties. The continued refinement of these approaches, combined with rigorous environmental impact assessments, will be critical in realizing their full potential for sustainable nanotechnology.

Its ability to capture secondary and backscattered electrons allows for the differentiation of materials based on their elemental composition, which is particularly useful in applications involving heterogeneous nanomaterials [1]. However, SEM has limited depth penetration and cannot provide atomic-level resolution, which restricts its applicability in studying internal structures.\n\nIn contrast, TEM offers atomic-scale resolution, making it the gold standard for observing the internal structure of nanoparticles and nanostructures. By transmitting electrons through a thin sample, TEM can reveal crystalline arrangements, defects, and interfacial features that are critical for understanding material behavior [1].

These methods provide critical insights into the composition, crystallinity, and phase behavior of nanomaterials, which are essential for both fundamental research and practical applications. Among the most widely used techniques are X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), each offering unique advantages in probing different aspects of nanomaterials. XRD is particularly effective in determining crystalline structures and phase identification, as it relies on the diffraction of X-rays by the regular lattice of atoms in a crystal. This technique is especially valuable for studying the nanostructured forms of materials, where crystallographic information is crucial for understanding their properties [7]. In contrast, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy provide molecular-level insights by analyzing vibrational and rotational modes of chemical bonds. FTIR is particularly sensitive to functional groups and is widely used for characterizing surface chemistry and polymer-based nanomaterials [8]. Raman spectroscopy, on the other hand, is well-suited for studying carbon-based nanostructures and can provide information on crystallinity, defects, and strain [9]. EDS, often coupled with scanning or transmission electron microscopy, is a powerful technique for elemental composition mapping, making it indispensable in the analysis of heterogeneous nanomaterials [10]. While these techniques have established themselves as cornerstones of nanomaterial characterization, they also present certain limitations. For instance, XRD may struggle with amorphous or poorly crystalline materials, and Raman spectroscopy can be affected by fluorescence from the sample. Furthermore, the interpretation of spectroscopic data often requires careful calibration and may involve complex modeling to extract meaningful information. Recent advances in machine learning and data-driven approaches have begun to address some of these challenges by enabling faster and more accurate analysis of large datasets [11; 12]. Emerging trends in the field include the integration of in-situ and real-time measurements, which allow for dynamic monitoring of structural and chemical changes during synthesis or application. For example, in-situ XRD and Raman spectroscopy can reveal the kinetics of phase transformations and reaction mechanisms, providing a deeper understanding of nanomaterial behavior under operational conditions [13].

This subsection addresses the essential role of such collaborations in overcoming the multifaceted challenges associated with nanomaterials, while highlighting critical knowledge gaps that must be addressed for the responsible advancement of the field. The integration of these disciplines is crucial not only for understanding the biological and environmental implications of nanomaterials but also for developing sustainable and scalable applications in biomedical and agricultural contexts.\n\nA key challenge in this area is the lack of a unified framework for risk assessment that encompasses both the biological and environmental dimensions of nanoparticle behavior. While toxicological studies provide insights into cellular and tissue-level interactions, environmental scientists contribute essential data on the fate and transport of nanoparticles in ecosystems. Bridging these domains requires shared data platforms and standardized protocols for characterizing nanoparticle behavior across different environmental matrices. For example, the integration of toxicological data with environmental fate models can improve the predictive capacity of risk assessment frameworks, as demonstrated by studies that combine machine learning with environmental monitoring [2]. These integrated approaches are essential for addressing the long-term ecological impacts of nanoparticle release and accumulation, which remain poorly understood due to the complexity of natural systems.\n\nAnother critical area for interdisciplinary collaboration is the development of standardized testing and reporting protocols. The current regulatory landscape for nanomaterials is fragmented, with varying guidelines across different countries and industries. This lack of harmonization creates barriers to the safe and effective deployment of nanotechnology. Efforts such as those outlined in the work on benchmarking Bayesian optimization across experimental materials science domains [3] demonstrate the potential for collaborative frameworks to establish common metrics and performance indicators. Such initiatives can facilitate the sharing of experimental data, enhance reproducibility, and support the development of more robust regulatory standards.\n\nMoreover, the integration of computational modeling with experimental validation is essential for addressing the knowledge gaps in nanoparticle behavior. While machine learning and simulation techniques offer powerful tools for predicting nanoparticle properties and interactions, these models must be validated through rigorous experimental studies. The use of deep learning for inverse design of two-dimensional materials [1] and the application of Bayesian optimization in materials design [26] illustrate the potential of computational approaches to guide experimental efforts. However, these methods require interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure that theoretical predictions are grounded in empirical data and that the models accurately reflect real-world conditions.\n\nFinally, the role of stakeholder engagement cannot be overstated. Policymakers, industry leaders, and the public must be actively involved in the development and governance of nanotechnology to ensure that it aligns with societal values and environmental sustainability. The work on autonomous robotic fabrication [1] and the integration of AI in materials discovery [1] highlights the importance of collaborative innovation in shaping the future of nanotechnology.
