# Computational Thinking in Education with Scratch: A Comprehensive Survey

## 1 Introduction

Computational thinking (CT) has emerged as a critical skill in the 21st century, transcending traditional boundaries of computer science to become a foundational element of education across disciplines. Rooted in the ability to solve problems, design systems, and understand human behavior through computational principles, CT has been increasingly recognized as essential for preparing learners to navigate an increasingly complex and technology-driven world [1]. The concept, first articulated by Jeannette Wing in 2006, has since evolved into a multidimensional framework encompassing problem decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking [1]. As a result, CT has gained traction in educational curricula, with a growing emphasis on its integration into K-12 and higher education systems. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of Scratch, a block-based programming environment, in fostering CT skills among learners of all ages. Scratch, developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab, has become a widely adopted tool in computational thinking education due to its intuitive, visual interface and emphasis on creativity and collaboration [1; 1]. Its design philosophy aligns with constructivist learning theories, encouraging students to explore, experiment, and construct knowledge through hands-on programming activities [1; 1]. The purpose of this survey is to examine the theoretical foundations, pedagogical applications, and empirical evidence surrounding the use of Scratch in CT education. It explores how Scratch supports the development of core CT skills, its effectiveness in different educational contexts, and the challenges and opportunities it presents. Additionally, the survey evaluates the role of Scratch in promoting inclusivity, creativity, and problem-solving abilities, while addressing the limitations of block-based programming in transitioning to more advanced computational concepts. A particular focus is placed on the intersection of CT and computational literacy, with an emphasis on how Scratch can serve as a gateway to text-based programming and more complex computational tasks. As the landscape of CT education continues to evolve, the integration of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and machine learning into Scratch-based learning environments presents new possibilities for enhancing CT instruction [1; 1]. This survey also highlights the need for continued research into assessment methodologies, teacher training, and curriculum development to ensure that Scratch remains an effective and equitable tool for computational thinking education. By synthesizing existing research and identifying gaps in the literature, this survey contributes to the ongoing discourse on how to best leverage Scratch and other computational tools to empower learners and prepare them for future challenges.

## 2 Theoretical Foundations of Computational Thinking in Education

### 2.1 Foundational Learning Theories in Computational Thinking

Computational thinking (CT) as an educational construct is deeply rooted in foundational learning theories that shape how students engage with problem-solving and algorithmic reasoning. These theories not only provide a conceptual framework for understanding how learning occurs but also inform the design of pedagogical strategies that leverage tools like Scratch to foster CT skills. Constructivism, inquiry-based learning, and problem-based learning are among the most influential theories that underpin CT education, each offering distinct perspectives on how learners interact with computational concepts.

Constructivism, as articulated by Piaget and Vygotsky, emphasizes the active role of learners in constructing knowledge through interaction with their environment [1]. In the context of CT, Scratch's block-based interface aligns closely with constructivist principles by enabling students to experiment, iterate, and construct their understanding of computational concepts through hands-on exploration. This is supported by empirical evidence showing that Scratch-based learning promotes deeper conceptual understanding through active engagement and reflection [2]. By allowing learners to manipulate visual blocks and observe immediate feedback, Scratch provides an environment where learners can build and refine their computational knowledge in a way that mirrors the constructivist ideal of knowledge as a product of active inquiry.

Inquiry-based learning further reinforces this approach by positioning the learner as an inquisitive agent who explores questions, investigates phenomena, and develops solutions through computational reasoning [1]. Scratch’s open-ended nature encourages learners to ask questions, test hypotheses, and engage in iterative problem-solving, which are essential components of inquiry-based learning. This aligns with findings from studies that demonstrate how Scratch supports the development of metacognitive strategies and reflective practices in computational problem-solving [3]. The ability to remix and modify existing projects also fosters a culture of inquiry, as students engage with the work of others and build upon it to develop new insights.

Problem-based learning (PBL) extends these ideas by embedding computational thinking within real-world contexts that require students to apply their knowledge to solve authentic challenges [1]. Scratch’s capacity to support multimedia projects, simulations, and interactive applications makes it a powerful tool for PBL. By tackling real-world problems, students not only develop CT skills but also gain a deeper understanding of how these skills can be applied across disciplines. This is supported by research showing that PBL frameworks integrated with Scratch improve students’ ability to connect computational concepts with practical applications [4].

These learning theories collectively shape the pedagogical design of Scratch-based CT instruction, emphasizing active learning, inquiry, and real-world relevance. Future research should continue to explore how these theories can be further adapted to support diverse learner needs, particularly in the context of emerging technologies such as AI and machine learning, which are increasingly influencing CT education. As the field evolves, a deeper integration of these theoretical foundations will be critical to ensuring that CT education remains both effective and equitable.

### 2.2 Cognitive Development and Computational Thinking

Computational thinking (CT) and cognitive development are deeply intertwined, with the latter providing a foundational framework for understanding how learners engage with and internalize CT concepts. Scratch, as a visual and interactive programming environment, plays a pivotal role in this process by aligning with developmental stages and supporting the progressive construction of computational reasoning. The visual block-based interface of Scratch mitigates cognitive load, enabling learners to focus on algorithmic thinking rather than syntax, thereby facilitating the transition from concrete to abstract reasoning. This alignment with cognitive development is particularly critical in early education, where learners are building foundational skills that underpin later computational proficiency [1].

One of the primary ways Scratch supports cognitive development is through its emphasis on visual and concrete thinking. Young learners, who are typically in the preoperational or concrete operational stages of Piaget’s cognitive development theory, benefit from the tangible, manipulable nature of Scratch’s block-based programming. This approach reduces the abstraction inherent in traditional programming, allowing learners to experiment with cause-and-effect relationships and iterative problem-solving. Research indicates that Scratch fosters metacognitive development by encouraging learners to reflect on their problem-solving processes and refine their strategies through debugging and iterative design [1].

Scratch’s design also addresses cognitive load theory by simplifying the programming process. By abstracting syntax, the platform allows learners to concentrate on the logic and structure of their programs, which aligns with Sweller’s theory of cognitive load. This is particularly beneficial for novice learners, as it minimizes extraneous cognitive load and promotes the development of intrinsic cognitive load management skills. Furthermore, the platform’s interactivity and immediate feedback mechanisms support active learning, reinforcing conceptual understanding and fostering a sense of agency in the learning process [1].

The relationship between computational thinking and cognitive development is further underscored by empirical studies that highlight how Scratch supports the development of foundational CT skills such as decomposition, pattern recognition, and abstraction. These skills are not only critical for programming but also align with broader cognitive development milestones. For instance, a longitudinal study on Scratch users demonstrated that sustained engagement with the platform enhances problem-solving abilities and increases learners’ capacity for complex reasoning [1].

Despite its strengths, Scratch’s visual interface may pose challenges for learners transitioning to more abstract or text-based programming environments. This highlights the need for scaffolded learning experiences that bridge the gap between block-based and text-based programming. Future research should explore how Scratch can be extended to support advanced computational thinking skills while maintaining its accessibility for young learners [1; 5].

### 2.3 Pedagogical Frameworks and Computational Thinking Instruction

Pedagogical frameworks play a crucial role in shaping the implementation of computational thinking (CT) through Scratch, providing structured approaches that align with both learning theories and practical classroom needs. These frameworks emphasize instructional design, learner engagement, and the cultivation of CT skills through deliberate and scaffolded learning experiences. Research has identified several key pedagogical models that have been adapted for Scratch-based CT instruction, including scaffolding, collaborative learning, and differentiated instruction. Each of these models addresses distinct aspects of CT development, offering a multi-faceted approach to computational education.

Scaffolding is a central component in supporting novice learners in developing CT skills. It involves the provision of structured guidance that gradually decreases as learners become more autonomous. In the context of Scratch, this often manifests through guided tutorials, incremental challenges, and task-specific feedback mechanisms. Scaffolding is closely related to the concept of "soft scaffolding" [1], which emphasizes the importance of adaptable and analytical support that fosters self-regulation and metacognitive reflection. For instance, tools like LitterBox and Whisker have been developed to provide automated feedback on code quality and debugging, aligning with the principles of scaffolding [1]. These systems help learners navigate the complexities of CT by identifying common errors and suggesting corrections, thereby reducing cognitive load and enhancing learning outcomes.

Collaborative and social constructivist approaches further enrich CT instruction by promoting peer interaction, shared problem-solving, and knowledge co-construction. The Scratch online community, with its features for remixing and sharing projects, provides an ideal environment for such collaborative learning [1]. Research has shown that remixing not only fosters creativity but also enhances computational thinking by exposing learners to diverse problem-solving strategies [1]. Moreover, collaborative projects encourage learners to articulate their reasoning, reflect on their work, and engage in peer feedback, all of which are essential for deepening CT understanding [6]. This aligns with the constructivist perspective that knowledge is constructed through active engagement and social interaction [1].

Differentiated instruction is another critical framework that addresses the diverse needs of learners in Scratch-based CT education. This approach recognizes that students have varying levels of prior experience, learning preferences, and cognitive abilities, necessitating flexible instructional strategies. By offering a range of project-based tasks, open-ended challenges, and adaptive feedback mechanisms, educators can support both guided and self-directed exploration of CT concepts [5]. For example, the use of personalized learning pathways, as seen in tools like Scratch Copilot, enables learners to engage with CT in ways that align with their individual goals and interests [1].

In conclusion, the integration of pedagogical frameworks in Scratch-based CT instruction offers a robust foundation for fostering computational thinking skills. By combining scaffolding, collaboration, and differentiation, educators can create inclusive and effective learning environments that support diverse learners. Emerging trends, such as the use of AI-based tutoring systems and adaptive learning tools, suggest that the future of CT instruction will be increasingly personalized and data-driven [1; 1]. These developments highlight the importance of continued research and innovation in pedagogical approaches to ensure that computational thinking remains accessible and impactful for all learners.

### 2.4 Integrating Computational Thinking with Educational Objectives

Computational thinking (CT) has emerged as a critical component of modern educational curricula, aligning with broader educational objectives such as fostering critical thinking, creativity, and interdisciplinary learning. Its integration into educational frameworks is not merely a technical endeavor but a pedagogical and cognitive transformation that supports students in developing essential skills for the digital age. Scratch, as a block-based programming environment, provides a unique platform for this integration, offering a balance between accessibility and complexity that accommodates diverse learner needs while promoting CT skills across multiple domains [1].

One of the most significant contributions of CT to education is its role in enhancing critical thinking. Computational thinking encourages students to break down problems into manageable parts, recognize patterns, and develop algorithmic solutions—skills that are transferable across disciplines. Research has shown that Scratch’s visual and interactive nature supports this process by enabling learners to experiment with abstract concepts in a concrete, tangible way [1]. For instance, studies have demonstrated that Scratch-based activities help students develop logical reasoning and systematic problem-solving abilities, which are central to critical thinking [1]. Moreover, the open-ended nature of Scratch projects allows for the exploration of multiple solutions, reinforcing the idea that there is often more than one way to approach a problem [2].

Creativity is another core educational objective that CT and Scratch align with. Unlike traditional programming paradigms that emphasize syntax and structure, Scratch encourages students to think outside the box, fostering innovation through the creation of multimedia projects, games, and stories. This aligns with the growing emphasis on 21st-century skills, where creativity is increasingly recognized as a crucial component of education [1]. Studies have found that Scratch’s creative freedom not only enhances engagement but also supports the development of expressive and divergent thinking [7]. For example, research by Resnick et al. [1] highlights how Scratch’s design principles promote a “creative learning” approach that empowers students to explore and express their ideas in meaningful ways.

Interdisciplinary learning is another area where CT and Scratch contribute significantly. Computational thinking is inherently interdisciplinary, as it draws upon concepts from mathematics, science, and the arts. Scratch’s versatility allows it to be integrated into various subjects, supporting the development of CT skills in context-specific ways. For instance, in science education, students can use Scratch to model physical phenomena, while in the arts, they can create interactive digital stories and animations [8]. This cross-disciplinary application not only reinforces CT concepts but also demonstrates their relevance in real-world scenarios [2].

As CT continues to gain traction in education, it is essential to consider how these objectives can be more effectively integrated into curricula. Emerging trends, such as the use of AI-augmented tools like ChatScratch and the incorporation of game-based learning, offer new possibilities for enhancing CT education [9]. However, challenges such as the need for teacher training, assessment standardization, and equitable access remain significant barriers to widespread adoption. Future research should focus on developing more robust frameworks for integrating CT into educational practices while ensuring that all learners can benefit from its potential.

### 2.5 Theoretical Models for Assessing Computational Thinking in Scratch

Assessing computational thinking (CT) in Scratch environments requires a combination of pedagogical and technological approaches that align with the unique characteristics of block-based programming. Theoretical models for CT assessment in Scratch must account for the platform’s visual, interactive, and open-ended nature, while also addressing the challenges of measuring complex cognitive processes such as problem decomposition, algorithm design, and abstraction. Various frameworks have been proposed to evaluate CT development, with a focus on both formative and summative assessment methods.

Competency-based assessment models, such as those grounded in Bloom’s Taxonomy [1], have been applied to evaluate CT skills in Scratch by categorizing student performance across cognitive domains, from knowledge and comprehension to analysis and evaluation. These models provide structured rubrics that help educators gauge the depth of CT skills developed through Scratch projects. However, they often rely on predefined criteria that may not fully capture the creative and exploratory aspects of learning in Scratch. For instance, the Computational Thinking Assessment Framework [1] has been adapted to Scratch environments, incorporating both task-specific metrics and reflective self-assessment to better align with the platform’s open-ended nature.

Dynamic and formative assessment methods have also gained traction in Scratch-based CT education. These approaches emphasize real-time feedback, interactive evaluation, and iterative improvement, allowing learners to refine their CT skills through continuous engagement. Tools such as LitterBox [1] and Whisker [1] automate the detection of common bugs in Scratch programs, offering immediate feedback that supports debugging and conceptual understanding. Such tools are particularly effective in fostering metacognitive development, as they encourage students to reflect on their problem-solving processes and adjust their strategies accordingly.

Emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, are increasingly being integrated into CT assessment models. AI-driven systems, such as ChatScratch [1], provide personalized guidance and support, helping learners navigate complex computational tasks. These systems leverage natural language processing to offer explanations, suggest alternative approaches, and identify areas for improvement. Similarly, automated testing frameworks like the Whisker test generation system [5] enable the dynamic evaluation of Scratch programs, supporting both individual and classroom-based assessment. These innovations represent a shift toward more adaptive and scalable assessment methodologies that can accommodate diverse learning needs and contexts.

Despite these advancements, challenges remain in accurately measuring CT in block-based environments. The reliance on visual and conceptual reasoning in Scratch complicates the development of standardized metrics that capture the full range of CT skills. Additionally, the open-ended nature of Scratch projects often makes it difficult to establish clear benchmarks for success. Future research should focus on integrating multi-modal assessment strategies that combine quantitative metrics with qualitative analyses, as well as developing more sophisticated AI-based tools that can support holistic CT evaluation in Scratch. By addressing these challenges, researchers and educators can continue to refine and enhance the theoretical models that underpin CT assessment in block-based programming environments.

## 3 Scratch as a Tool for Teaching Computational Thinking

### 3.1 Design and Features of Scratch

The design and features of Scratch have been instrumental in establishing it as a powerful tool for teaching computational thinking (CT) across diverse educational contexts. As a block-based visual programming environment, Scratch's interface is intentionally crafted to reduce cognitive load and promote intuitive learning, enabling learners of all ages to engage with computational concepts without the burden of syntax errors [1]. This visual approach is grounded in the principles of constructivism, where learners actively construct knowledge through exploration and experimentation, making Scratch particularly effective for developing foundational CT skills such as problem decomposition, pattern recognition, and algorithm design [1].

At the core of Scratch's design is its block-based logic, which allows users to assemble programs by dragging and dropping pre-defined code blocks. This structure eliminates the need to memorize syntax, allowing learners to focus on the logic and flow of their programs. Studies have shown that this approach significantly reduces the barriers to entry for programming, making it more accessible to young learners and those with limited prior experience [1]. The block-based interface also supports the development of abstraction, as learners can encapsulate complex operations into reusable blocks, mirroring the principles of modular programming [1].

Another defining feature of Scratch is its emphasis on collaboration and community. The platform's online community, Scratch, provides a space for learners to share, remix, and build upon each other's projects, fostering a culture of peer learning and collective knowledge construction. This collaborative aspect is not only valuable for reinforcing CT concepts but also for developing soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and critical thinking [1]. The ability to remix projects encourages learners to analyze, modify, and extend existing code, which is a crucial practice in computational thinking [5]. Furthermore, research has demonstrated that remixing is associated with increased exposure to a wider range of programming constructs, supporting the development of more sophisticated CT skills [2].

In addition to its visual and collaborative features, Scratch integrates multimedia capabilities that enhance engagement and support the creation of rich, interactive projects. The platform supports graphics, sound, and animation, allowing learners to express computational ideas in creative and meaningful ways. This multimodal approach aligns with the principles of multiple intelligences theory, as it caters to diverse learning styles and preferences [1]. Moreover, the integration of multimedia elements can enhance motivation and retention, making Scratch a compelling platform for both formal and informal learning [2].

Despite its strengths, Scratch is not without limitations. While it is highly effective for introductory CT instruction, its block-based nature may not fully prepare learners for the complexities of text-based programming. However, research has shown that Scratch can serve as a bridge to more advanced programming environments, with hybrid approaches demonstrating improved transfer of programming skills [10]. Future developments in Scratch, such as AI-enhanced learning support and integration with emerging technologies, may further expand its capabilities and relevance in CT education [11]. As the landscape of computational thinking continues to evolve, Scratch's design and features will remain central to its role as an accessible, engaging, and effective learning tool.

### 3.2 Pedagogical Applications of Scratch

Scratch has emerged as a pivotal tool in the pedagogical landscape of computational thinking, offering a versatile platform that supports diverse instructional approaches. Its application in classroom settings spans project-based learning, gamification, and collaborative tasks, each of which plays a distinct role in fostering computational thinking skills. Project-based learning with Scratch allows students to engage in long-term, interdisciplinary projects that require problem-solving, algorithmic reasoning, and creative expression [1]. By designing and building their own projects, students are encouraged to decompose complex problems, recognize patterns, and develop abstract representations, all of which are core aspects of computational thinking. Research has shown that such student-centered approaches not only enhance technical skills but also promote deeper conceptual understanding and motivation [1].  

Gamification further enriches the learning experience by embedding computational thinking within playful, goal-oriented activities. Scratch's support for game design and storytelling enables students to create interactive projects that integrate algorithmic thinking and logical reasoning. This approach not only makes learning more engaging but also aligns with the intrinsic motivation of learners, as highlighted in studies on the effectiveness of game-based learning in STEM education [2]. Furthermore, the use of game templates in Scratch, as explored in the No One Left Behind (NOLB) project, provides structured frameworks that guide students in applying computational concepts while fostering creativity and innovation [2].  

Collaborative learning and remixing represent another critical dimension of Scratch's pedagogical value. The platform's online community and remixing capabilities encourage peer interaction, knowledge sharing, and collective problem-solving [2]. Research has demonstrated that collaborative activities, such as group projects and peer reviews, enhance students' ability to communicate, negotiate, and co-construct knowledge. For instance, a study on the Scratch community found that users who frequently remix projects develop a broader repertoire of programming commands and are more likely to apply computational thinking concepts in their own work [2]. This social learning dynamic not only supports the development of technical skills but also cultivates a sense of community and shared purpose among learners.  

The integration of Scratch into formal curricula further underscores its pedagogical versatility. Educators have successfully aligned Scratch-based activities with curricular goals, using it to teach subjects ranging from mathematics and science to the arts. Assessment tools and feedback mechanisms, such as automated testing and AI-powered debugging, have also been developed to support formative and summative evaluations of computational thinking [2]. However, challenges remain, particularly in scaling Scratch-based learning to more advanced programming concepts and ensuring equitable access to technology.  

As Scratch continues to evolve, its pedagogical applications will likely expand, incorporating emerging technologies such as AI and augmented reality. The development of personalized learning pathways and adaptive tutoring systems will further enhance its effectiveness in diverse educational contexts. By addressing current limitations and leveraging its strengths, Scratch can remain a cornerstone of computational thinking education, supporting learners at all levels in developing the skills needed for the digital age.

### 3.3 Role of Visual Programming in Early Computational Learning

Visual programming has emerged as a pivotal strategy in early computational learning, offering a scaffolded pathway for young learners to engage with computational thinking (CT) concepts. By abstracting the complexities of syntax and emphasizing logical reasoning, block-based programming environments like Scratch provide an accessible entry point for children to develop foundational CT skills. This subsection examines the pedagogical benefits of visual programming in early education, highlighting its role in cognitive development, skill acquisition, and bridging the gap to more advanced programming paradigms.

One of the primary advantages of visual programming is its ability to reduce cognitive load, allowing learners to focus on algorithmic thinking rather than the intricacies of syntax [12]. This is particularly critical in early education, where young learners are still developing their abstract reasoning abilities. Research indicates that the visual and tactile nature of block-based programming supports concrete thinking, making it easier for children to grasp concepts like loops, conditionals, and event-driven logic [13]. Furthermore, the immediate feedback and interactive nature of such platforms foster a sense of accomplishment and motivation, which are essential for sustained engagement in computational learning.

The role of visual programming in fostering core CT skills such as decomposition, pattern recognition, and abstraction is well-documented. By manipulating blocks to construct simple programs, learners implicitly engage with these skills in a way that is both intuitive and enjoyable [14]. For example, projects involving animations or games require learners to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts, a practice that mirrors the decomposition process in CT [14]. Studies also show that the structured yet flexible environment of block-based programming encourages exploration and experimentation, which are vital for developing creative problem-solving abilities [13].

Moreover, visual programming serves as a preparatory step for transitioning to text-based programming. By building a conceptual foundation in CT through block-based tools, learners are better equipped to navigate the challenges of more complex languages like Python or JavaScript [15]. This transition is further supported by tools such as CodeMapper and Scratch Copilot, which provide guidance and support for learners as they move from visual to text-based programming [16].

Despite its advantages, visual programming is not without limitations. The simplicity of block-based environments can sometimes lead to an over-reliance on visual elements, potentially hindering the development of deeper computational reasoning [12]. Additionally, the lack of advanced debugging tools and limited support for complex computational concepts can pose challenges for more advanced learners [12]. Nonetheless, ongoing innovations, such as AI-enhanced learning support and extensions like CryptoScratch, are addressing these limitations and expanding the scope of visual programming in CT education [17; 18].

In conclusion, visual programming plays a crucial role in early computational learning by providing an accessible, engaging, and effective platform for developing CT skills. As research continues to explore its potential and address its limitations, it is clear that block-based programming will remain a cornerstone of computational education for young learners.

### 3.4 Technological and Educational Innovations in Scratch

Recent technological and pedagogical innovations have significantly expanded the capabilities of Scratch as a computational thinking (CT) tool, enabling more sophisticated learning experiences and broader educational applications. These advancements reflect a growing emphasis on integrating artificial intelligence (AI), emerging technologies, and specialized extensions to enhance the platform's functionality and pedagogical impact [17]. For instance, AI-enhanced learning support tools such as ChatScratch and Scratch Copilot have emerged to provide personalized guidance, debugging assistance, and creative ideation for young learners, thereby reducing the cognitive load and enhancing engagement [19]. These tools leverage natural language processing and machine learning to offer real-time support, effectively bridging the gap between novice understanding and complex problem-solving [19]. 

In parallel, Scratch has been integrated with emerging technologies like augmented reality (AR) and robotics, creating new avenues for experiential learning. For example, extensions such as ScratchVR and ScratchX enable learners to interact with 3D environments and physical devices, thereby extending the scope of CT beyond purely digital environments and fostering a deeper understanding of computational concepts in real-world contexts [20]. These integrations not only enhance the interactivity of Scratch but also align with the growing interest in interdisciplinary learning and STEM education.

Additionally, the development of specialized extensions like CryptoScratch and Patch has introduced learners to advanced CT concepts such as cryptography, algorithm design, and complex data structures [17]. These extensions allow students to explore topics that were previously inaccessible in block-based programming, thereby promoting a more nuanced understanding of computational principles. By providing a scaffolded transition from visual to text-based programming, these tools help learners build foundational skills while gradually introducing them to more advanced programming paradigms.

The evolution of Scratch has also been accompanied by the development of tools for assessment and feedback, such as automated testing frameworks and AI-based evaluation systems. These innovations support both formative and summative assessment, enabling educators to monitor student progress and provide targeted feedback. For example, tools like LitterBox and NuzzleBug automate the detection of common errors, thereby facilitating more efficient debugging and enhancing the learning experience [21]. Moreover, the integration of AI in assessment processes allows for more personalized and adaptive evaluations, aligning with the broader trend of data-driven education [22].

These technological and pedagogical innovations have not only expanded the scope of Scratch but also highlighted the need for continued research and development to address emerging challenges. Future directions should focus on refining AI tools for more accurate and context-sensitive support, enhancing collaboration features to foster peer learning, and ensuring equitable access to these innovations. By addressing these challenges, Scratch can continue to serve as a vital platform for teaching computational thinking in diverse educational contexts.

### 3.5 Challenges and Limitations in Using Scratch for CT Development

Scratch, despite its widespread adoption as a tool for teaching computational thinking (CT), presents several challenges and limitations that educators and learners must navigate. These challenges span technical, pedagogical, and equity-related dimensions, and they highlight the need for continued refinement of the platform and its integration into formal educational frameworks. One of the primary technical limitations of Scratch is its scalability and flexibility in handling complex programming tasks. While Scratch is highly effective for introductory programming and small-scale projects, it lacks the advanced features necessary for more sophisticated computational thinking, such as parallel processing, recursion, and algorithm optimization [23]. This restricts its utility for students who aim to transition to text-based programming languages like Python or Java, creating a gap in the learning continuum [23]. Moreover, the block-based interface, while beneficial for reducing cognitive load for beginners, may hinder the development of deeper computational reasoning skills by over-relying on visual elements [24]. This can lead to an overemphasis on visual creativity at the expense of abstract thinking and algorithmic logic.

From a pedagogical perspective, Scratch faces challenges related to curriculum alignment and teacher training. Many educators lack the specialized training needed to effectively incorporate Scratch into their teaching, leading to underutilization or improper implementation of the platform [25]. This is exacerbated by the lack of standardized and reliable assessment tools to measure CT skills developed through Scratch, making it difficult to evaluate student progress and learning outcomes [25]. Furthermore, the open-ended, exploratory nature of Scratch often conflicts with conventional curriculum structures that prioritize standardized assessments and structured learning outcomes, creating a mismatch between the platform's design and traditional educational frameworks [25].

Equity and accessibility concerns also pose significant barriers to the effective use of Scratch. Disparities in technology access mean that students from low-income backgrounds or under-resourced schools may lack the necessary devices, internet connectivity, or software to fully engage with Scratch, thereby exacerbating the digital divide [26]. While Scratch is designed to be accessible, it may not fully accommodate the needs of students with disabilities or diverse learning styles, highlighting the need for more inclusive and adaptive features [26]. Additionally, the predominance of English in Scratch's interface and resources may limit its accessibility for non-English speaking students, reducing its global impact and effectiveness [26].

Another critical limitation is the lack of robust debugging tools in Scratch, which can make it difficult for students to identify and fix errors in their code. This hinders the development of essential problem-solving strategies, such as debugging and logical reasoning, which are crucial for CT [24]. Furthermore, while Scratch's community-driven features, such as remixing and sharing, foster peer interaction and knowledge construction, they lack advanced collaboration and real-time editing capabilities, limiting the potential for group-based computational thinking activities [24]. These limitations underscore the need for enhanced features and tools that support more advanced CT practices and foster deeper learning experiences. Addressing these challenges will be essential for maximizing the potential of Scratch as a tool for CT development in diverse educational contexts.

## 4 Pedagogical Approaches and Teaching Strategies with Scratch

### 4.1 Project-Based and Inquiry-Based Learning with Scratch

Project-based and inquiry-based learning approaches have emerged as powerful pedagogical strategies for fostering computational thinking (CT) through Scratch, a block-based programming environment. These approaches emphasize active, student-centered learning, where learners engage in meaningful, open-ended tasks that promote problem-solving, creativity, and deeper conceptual understanding. Project-based learning (PBL) encourages students to construct knowledge by working on extended, authentic projects that often involve collaboration, real-world problem-solving, and iterative refinement [1]. Inquiry-based learning (IBL), on the other hand, fosters curiosity and critical thinking by guiding students to ask questions, explore phenomena, and develop hypotheses through computational reasoning [1]. Together, these approaches align well with the nature of Scratch, which offers a flexible and interactive platform for learners to experiment, iterate, and reflect on their computational thinking processes.

In PBL settings, Scratch enables students to design and implement projects that integrate multiple CT skills, such as decomposition, pattern recognition, and abstraction. For example, students might create interactive stories, games, or simulations that require them to break down complex problems into smaller components, identify patterns in their code, and develop abstractions to manage complexity [1]. The open-ended nature of Scratch projects allows for a high degree of personalization and creativity, making it an ideal medium for fostering both technical and creative thinking. However, PBL in Scratch also presents challenges, such as the need for scaffolding to support students in navigating the complexity of project design and implementation [1].

Inquiry-based learning with Scratch encourages students to engage in exploratory tasks that promote deeper understanding through questioning and experimentation. For instance, learners might investigate how different programming constructs affect the behavior of a game or simulation, leading to insights about algorithmic thinking and debugging [1]. This approach supports the development of metacognitive skills, as students are prompted to reflect on their problem-solving strategies and adjust their approaches based on feedback and observation. Research has shown that IBL can enhance students' engagement and motivation, particularly when tasks are aligned with their interests and prior knowledge [5].

Both PBL and IBL in Scratch are supported by a growing body of empirical evidence that highlights their effectiveness in promoting CT. Studies have demonstrated that students engaged in project-based Scratch activities show improved problem-solving abilities, increased creativity, and a better understanding of computational concepts [2]. Similarly, inquiry-based activities have been found to enhance students' ability to think critically and independently, as they are encouraged to explore and construct knowledge through experimentation [1]. These findings underscore the potential of Scratch as a platform for fostering CT through meaningful, student-driven learning experiences.

Despite the promising outcomes, challenges remain in effectively implementing PBL and IBL with Scratch. These include the need for robust assessment frameworks to measure CT development, as well as the importance of teacher support and professional development to facilitate these pedagogical approaches [2]. Future research should focus on refining these strategies, addressing the limitations of current assessment tools, and exploring how emerging technologies such as AI and machine learning can further enhance the learning experience in Scratch-based environments. By continuing to innovate and refine these approaches, educators can better support students in developing the computational thinking skills essential for the digital age.

### 4.2 Collaborative and Peer Learning in Scratch

Collaborative and peer learning in Scratch has emerged as a powerful pedagogical approach that enhances computational thinking by leveraging social interactions, shared problem-solving, and collective knowledge construction. The Scratch online community, with its emphasis on remixing and sharing, provides a dynamic platform for learners to engage in collaborative activities that foster deeper understanding and improved problem-solving skills. This subsection explores the mechanisms through which collaborative and peer learning contribute to computational thinking development in Scratch-based environments, drawing on empirical evidence and theoretical frameworks.

Research has shown that peer collaboration in Scratch-based learning environments promotes higher levels of engagement and creativity. When students work in groups, they are exposed to diverse perspectives and problem-solving strategies, which can lead to the development of more sophisticated computational thinking skills. For instance, a study by [27] demonstrated that frequent remixing of projects not only increases the repertoire of programming commands but also enhances the likelihood of applying computational thinking concepts in new contexts. This aligns with the broader theory of social learning, which posits that knowledge is co-constructed through interaction and shared experiences.

Moreover, collaborative projects in Scratch often involve roles such as project managers, coders, and testers, which simulate real-world software development environments. These roles encourage students to develop not only technical skills but also interpersonal and communication skills. According to [28], such collaborative approaches help students build a deeper understanding of the iterative and incremental nature of software development, which is essential for computational thinking.

The Scratch community’s online forums and shared projects further support peer learning by providing opportunities for students to receive feedback, ask questions, and learn from each other’s work. This form of social learning is particularly effective in fostering metacognitive skills, as students reflect on their own learning processes and the strategies used by their peers. The study by [29] highlights how collaborative learning can also address gender disparities in computing by creating inclusive spaces where all students can contribute and grow.

Despite the benefits, challenges remain in effectively implementing collaborative learning in Scratch. Issues such as uneven participation, lack of clear roles, and difficulty in managing group dynamics can hinder the learning process. To address these challenges, educators must provide structured guidance and support, ensuring that all students have meaningful roles within the group. Furthermore, the integration of automated feedback tools and peer assessment mechanisms can enhance the effectiveness of collaborative learning by providing timely and targeted support.

In conclusion, collaborative and peer learning in Scratch offers a rich and dynamic environment for developing computational thinking skills. As the field continues to evolve, future research should focus on refining collaborative learning strategies, enhancing tools for group collaboration, and exploring the long-term impact of peer-based learning on computational thinking development. By addressing these challenges and opportunities, educators can create more inclusive and effective learning environments that harness the power of collaboration to foster deeper computational thinking.

### 4.3 Scaffolding and Support Mechanisms in Scratch Education

Scaffolding and support mechanisms play a pivotal role in facilitating computational thinking (CT) development in Scratch education. Effective pedagogical strategies are designed to guide learners through the complexities of programming, ensuring they build foundational CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. These mechanisms are particularly crucial in block-based environments like Scratch, where learners may lack the syntactic knowledge to navigate more advanced programming paradigms. Guided instruction, feedback tools, and teacher support are integral components that enable educators to structure learning experiences that cater to diverse learner needs and promote deep, meaningful engagement with CT concepts [12; 30; 31].

One key scaffolding approach involves the use of structured tutorials and learning pathways that provide step-by-step guidance for learners. These resources help reduce cognitive load by breaking down complex programming tasks into manageable components. For example, educators often implement lesson plans that introduce Scratch's block-based interface incrementally, allowing learners to progressively build their understanding of programming logic and control structures [32]. This approach not only supports novice learners but also facilitates the transition to more advanced programming concepts.

Automated feedback and debugging tools further enhance the scaffolding process by offering real-time support to learners. Tools like LitterBox, NuzzleBug, and Whisker are designed to identify common errors in Scratch programs, helping students understand and correct mistakes without relying solely on instructor feedback [12; 33]. These tools are particularly beneficial in large classroom settings, where individualized attention may be limited. However, while these tools improve immediate problem-solving capabilities, they do not always address the deeper conceptual understanding that is essential for CT development [30].

Teacher support and professional development are equally critical in ensuring the successful implementation of scaffolding strategies. Educators need to be equipped with the pedagogical knowledge and technical expertise to effectively integrate Scratch into their curricula. Professional development programs that focus on CT pedagogy, such as those that incorporate collaborative learning and reflective practices, have been shown to improve instructional quality and student outcomes [34; 35].

Emerging trends in Scratch education also highlight the potential of AI-enhanced scaffolding. Tools like ChatScratch and Scratch Copilot leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide personalized coding guidance, helping students navigate complex programming tasks and develop metacognitive skills [19; 36]. These innovations open new possibilities for individualized learning and real-time support, although challenges related to accuracy, bias, and interpretability remain to be addressed [37].

In conclusion, scaffolding and support mechanisms in Scratch education are multifaceted and require a balanced approach that integrates guided instruction, automated tools, and teacher support. Future research should explore how these mechanisms can be further optimized through AI and adaptive learning technologies to enhance CT development across diverse learner populations.

### 4.4 Adaptive and Personalized Learning with Scratch

Adaptive and personalized learning approaches in Scratch-based education represent a significant shift toward learner-centered instruction, aiming to address individual differences in prior knowledge, learning pace, and cognitive styles. These strategies leverage the flexibility of Scratch’s block-based interface to create tailored learning experiences that enhance computational thinking (CT) development. By integrating tools such as AI-powered tutoring systems, automated feedback mechanisms, and adaptive scaffolding, educators can provide more targeted support, enabling students to progress at their own pace while engaging deeply with CT concepts.

One prominent example is the use of intelligent tutoring systems, such as Scratch Copilot and ChatScratch, which provide real-time guidance and support to learners. These systems analyze student input and generate personalized suggestions, helping novices navigate complex programming tasks while fostering independent problem-solving skills [19]. This aligns with the findings of Lin et al. [1], who emphasize that personalized feedback can significantly enhance learning outcomes by addressing specific misconceptions and supporting metacognitive development.

Another key approach involves the use of adaptive scaffolding frameworks, such as PQuizSyn, which generates pop quizzes tailored to individual student progress. These quizzes serve as dynamic scaffolds, helping students reinforce CT concepts and gradually build confidence in their programming abilities [38]. This method is particularly effective in addressing the variability in student performance and ensuring that learners receive challenges that are neither too easy nor too difficult, thereby maintaining engagement and promoting deeper learning.

Personalized learning pathways also play a crucial role in adapting instruction to diverse learner needs. For instance, the integration of differentiated instruction strategies allows educators to design activities that cater to varying levels of prior experience and learning styles. This is supported by research indicating that learners with lower self-efficacy benefit significantly from structured scaffolding and incremental challenges [39]. Such strategies help bridge the gap between novice and advanced learners, ensuring that all students can participate meaningfully in CT activities.

Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the effective implementation of adaptive and personalized learning in Scratch-based environments. Issues such as the scalability of AI-driven tools, the need for teacher training, and the integration of these approaches into existing curricula require further exploration. Future research should focus on refining these technologies and exploring their long-term impact on CT development, particularly in diverse educational contexts. As the field continues to evolve, the synergy between adaptive learning systems and Scratch’s intuitive design holds great promise for transforming computational thinking education into a more inclusive and effective practice.

### 4.5 Assessment and Evaluation in Scratch-Based Computational Thinking

Assessment and evaluation in Scratch-based computational thinking (CT) are critical for understanding student learning outcomes, refining pedagogical strategies, and ensuring that CT skills are effectively developed. Scratch, with its block-based visual programming interface, presents unique opportunities and challenges for assessment, as traditional metrics often fail to capture the nuanced and creative aspects of CT. This subsection examines the evolving landscape of assessment methodologies in Scratch-based CT, emphasizing both formative and summative approaches that support student growth and instructional improvement.

Formative assessment plays a central role in Scratch-based CT education, allowing educators to monitor student progress in real-time and provide targeted feedback. Tools such as LitterBox [12] and NuzzleBug [12], which automatically detect common coding errors, enable learners to identify and correct mistakes, thereby fostering metacognitive skills and deeper understanding of CT principles. Peer reviews and collaborative project critiques also contribute to formative assessment, promoting reflective practice and enhancing problem-solving abilities [27]. These methods align with the constructivist philosophy underpinning Scratch, where learning is an active, iterative process involving exploration and experimentation.

Summative assessment, on the other hand, is essential for evaluating the extent to which students have mastered CT skills. Traditional methods, such as coding challenges and project-based evaluations, are often used to measure students’ ability to apply CT concepts in meaningful contexts [40]. However, these assessments may not fully capture the creative and abstract reasoning that characterizes CT in Scratch. To address this, researchers have developed rubrics that align with CT competencies, such as problem decomposition, pattern recognition, and algorithm design [41]. These frameworks provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of student performance, moving beyond syntactic correctness to evaluate the quality of computational thinking.

Emerging trends in assessment include the integration of AI and data analytics to enhance both formative and summative evaluation. For instance, the use of automated feedback systems, such as those employed in ChatScratch [42], allows for real-time, personalized guidance that supports students in refining their CT skills. Additionally, the analysis of user interaction data from Scratch projects, such as those in the longitudinal dataset [43], provides valuable insights into learning patterns and the development of CT over time.

Despite these advancements, challenges remain in developing standardized and equitable assessment tools that effectively measure CT in block-based environments. Issues such as bias, scalability, and the need for culturally responsive assessments continue to influence research and practice in this area [44]. Future directions should focus on refining existing tools, integrating more sophisticated analytics, and exploring the role of AI in personalizing and enhancing assessment practices to better support diverse learners.

## 5 Empirical Studies and Educational Outcomes with Scratch

### 5.1 Quantitative and Qualitative Research on Scratch and Computational Thinking

Empirical research on Scratch and computational thinking (CT) has demonstrated significant potential in fostering CT skills through both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Quantitative studies often employ standardized assessments, performance metrics, and learning analytics to measure CT development, while qualitative approaches rely on interviews, observations, and reflective journals to capture students’ experiences and perceptions. Together, these methods provide a comprehensive understanding of Scratch’s effectiveness as a CT learning tool. 

Quantitative research has consistently shown that Scratch supports the development of foundational CT skills such as decomposition, pattern recognition, and algorithmic thinking. For instance, studies have utilized standardized CT assessments to evaluate student performance before and after Scratch-based interventions, revealing measurable improvements in problem-solving abilities and logical reasoning [27]. Moreover, performance metrics such as code complexity, error rates, and project completion times have been used to assess the impact of Scratch on students' programming proficiency. For example, a study by [45] found that students who engaged with Scratch demonstrated significantly higher levels of algorithmic reasoning compared to those using traditional text-based programming environments. These findings are further supported by longitudinal studies that track the persistence of CT skills over time, indicating that early exposure to Scratch can yield lasting benefits in computational reasoning [43].

In addition to quantitative measures, qualitative research has provided rich insights into the learning experiences of Scratch users. Through in-depth interviews and observational studies, researchers have uncovered how students navigate the creative and exploratory nature of Scratch, often developing a deeper understanding of CT through iterative design and peer collaboration [46]. For example, [13] found that students who engaged in collaborative project development reported higher levels of engagement and a more nuanced understanding of CT concepts, as they were able to reflect on their own and others’ approaches to problem-solving. Qualitative studies also highlight the role of motivation and self-efficacy in CT learning, with many students expressing increased confidence and enjoyment in programming after using Scratch [27].

Comparative studies have further enriched the discourse by evaluating Scratch against other CT tools and platforms. These studies often employ mixed-methods approaches, combining quantitative performance data with qualitative feedback from learners and educators. For instance, [47] conducted a meta-analysis of multiple studies comparing block-based and text-based programming environments, finding that while Scratch provides a more accessible entry point for beginners, it may require additional scaffolding to support advanced CT development. Similarly, [48] explored the impact of gamification in Scratch-based learning, revealing that game-like challenges can enhance student motivation and engagement, particularly among younger learners.

Emerging trends in CT research emphasize the importance of integrating both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to capture the multifaceted nature of CT development. While quantitative approaches offer objective measures of skill acquisition, qualitative methods provide essential context and insight into the learning process. Future research should continue to explore hybrid models that leverage the strengths of both approaches, while also addressing challenges such as standardizing CT assessments and accounting for individual differences in learning styles. As Scratch continues to evolve, its role in CT education will likely expand, offering new opportunities for empirical investigation and pedagogical innovation.

### 5.2 Case Studies on CT Development with Scratch

The subsection "5.2 Case Studies on CT Development with Scratch" presents a synthesis of empirical studies that demonstrate the practical implementation of Scratch in fostering computational thinking (CT) across diverse educational settings, including primary, secondary, and higher education. These case studies highlight the effectiveness of Scratch in developing foundational CT skills, such as problem decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm design, while also addressing challenges and limitations in its application.  

In primary education, several studies have shown that Scratch serves as an effective tool for introducing young learners to CT through engaging, project-based activities. For instance, a longitudinal study [1] found that children in early elementary grades who engaged with Scratch demonstrated improved problem-solving abilities and a deeper understanding of algorithmic thinking. The study emphasized the role of creative expression and storytelling in motivating young learners, as they designed interactive games and animations that required them to think computationally. Similarly, a case study [49] on the use of Scratch in a Chilean high school revealed that students who participated in a C++ programming workshop showed significant improvements in CT, although the transition from block-based to text-based programming posed challenges for those with lower initial CT proficiency.  

At the secondary level, Scratch has been increasingly used to bridge the gap between introductory programming and more advanced computational concepts. A study [50] explored the use of Scratch in a secondary school setting, where students engaged in collaborative projects that required them to apply CT skills in real-world contexts. The researchers found that the open-ended nature of Scratch encouraged exploration and experimentation, fostering both creativity and critical thinking. Moreover, a case study [1] on the use of Scratch in a girls-only CT program highlighted the importance of collaborative learning and peer interaction in enhancing CT development. The study revealed that while students found debugging the most challenging CT practice, collaboration significantly improved their problem-solving abilities.  

In higher education, Scratch has been used as a preparatory tool for students transitioning to text-based programming. A study [51] evaluated the effectiveness of a hybrid-based learning approach, where students first learned programming fundamentals using Scratch before transitioning to text-based languages. The results showed that students who used this approach demonstrated better understanding and retention of programming concepts compared to those who exclusively used text-based programming. Additionally, a case study [7] on the integration of Scratch with advanced CT concepts, such as cryptography, demonstrated how the platform can be extended to support more complex computational tasks.  

These case studies collectively illustrate the versatility of Scratch in promoting CT development across educational levels. While Scratch's visual interface and ease of use make it accessible to beginners, challenges such as transitioning to text-based programming and assessing CT outcomes remain significant. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated assessment tools and exploring the integration of AI-driven feedback mechanisms to enhance the learning experience. Overall, the empirical evidence underscores the potential of Scratch as a powerful tool for fostering CT in diverse educational contexts.

### 5.3 Long-Term Effects of Scratch-Based Learning on CT Skills

The long-term effects of Scratch-based learning on computational thinking (CT) skills have been increasingly scrutinized through longitudinal studies and follow-up research, revealing sustained benefits that extend beyond initial engagement. These studies provide empirical evidence that early exposure to Scratch not only nurtures foundational CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, and algorithm design but also supports their retention and application in subsequent academic and professional contexts. Research indicates that students who engage with Scratch during their formative years demonstrate enhanced problem-solving abilities and a stronger capacity for logical reasoning, even when transitioning to more advanced programming environments [1; 1; 1]. This suggests that Scratch serves as a critical bridge, facilitating the development of CT skills that are transferable across disciplines and computational paradigms.

One of the most compelling findings from longitudinal studies is the correlation between early Scratch-based CT learning and long-term academic success in STEM fields. A study tracking students over a five-year period found that those who had significant Scratch experience in their early education were more likely to pursue advanced computer science courses and maintain higher academic performance compared to their peers with limited or no prior CT exposure [1; 1]. This aligns with broader educational research that underscores the importance of early CT exposure in shaping future career paths and technological literacy. Additionally, these students exhibited greater confidence in tackling complex problems and showed improved adaptability when introduced to new computational tools and methodologies.

Another critical aspect explored in longitudinal research is the role of Scratch in fostering metacognitive development and self-regulated learning. Studies have shown that the reflective and iterative nature of Scratch projects promotes the development of self-assessment skills, which are essential for long-term learning and mastery of CT concepts [5; 2]. For instance, students who frequently engaged in remixing and collaborative coding demonstrated enhanced awareness of their own learning processes, which in turn contributed to more effective problem-solving strategies and deeper conceptual understanding [1; 2].

However, challenges remain in quantifying the long-term impact of Scratch-based CT education, particularly in diverse and under-resourced educational settings. While the platform's visual and interactive design supports early CT development, the transition to text-based programming and advanced CT concepts requires additional scaffolding and targeted instruction [10; 11]. Future research should focus on developing longitudinal frameworks that account for socioeconomic, cultural, and pedagogical variables, ensuring that the benefits of Scratch-based CT education are accessible to all learners. Additionally, the integration of AI-driven tools and adaptive learning systems offers promising avenues for enhancing the sustainability and efficacy of CT skill development over time [2; 3]. These innovations may help bridge the gap between early CT learning and long-term computational fluency, reinforcing the role of Scratch as a foundational tool in the broader landscape of computational education.

### 5.4 Student Engagement and Motivation in Scratch-Based CT Learning

Student engagement and motivation are critical factors in the effectiveness of computational thinking (CT) learning, and empirical studies have consistently shown that Scratch plays a pivotal role in enhancing these aspects. Scratch’s visual, interactive, and creative environment fosters intrinsic motivation, allowing students to explore programming in a way that is both accessible and enjoyable. Research has demonstrated that the open-ended nature of Scratch projects encourages exploration, experimentation, and personal expression, which in turn increases student engagement and persistence in learning CT concepts [10; 2]. For example, a longitudinal study found that students who engaged in project-based learning with Scratch showed sustained interest and motivation over time, with many students continuing to explore and expand their projects even beyond structured classroom activities [2].  

One of the key mechanisms through which Scratch enhances engagement is its emphasis on creativity and collaboration. Studies have shown that students are more motivated to learn when they can create meaningful and personally relevant projects, and Scratch provides an ideal platform for this [10; 4]. For instance, a study on the Scratch community found that students who engaged in remixing projects—where they modified and built upon existing programs—showed greater mastery of CT concepts and higher levels of motivation compared to those who worked on isolated tasks [4]. The social and collaborative aspects of Scratch, such as peer feedback and shared project spaces, further enhance motivation by creating a sense of community and shared purpose [6].  

Additionally, Scratch's gamified elements, such as the ability to design and share games, have been shown to significantly boost student interest in CT learning. Research indicates that gamification increases engagement by providing clear goals, immediate feedback, and a sense of achievement, all of which are essential for sustaining motivation [10; 2]. A study on the use of game templates in Scratch-based learning environments found that students who used these templates were more likely to focus on subject-specific problem-solving rather than on mastering the software itself, leading to improved CT outcomes [2].  

While Scratch is highly effective in fostering engagement and motivation, challenges remain. Some studies have highlighted the potential for over-reliance on Scratch’s visual interface, which may hinder the development of deeper computational reasoning skills if not appropriately scaffolded [10; 2]. Furthermore, gender and socioeconomic factors can influence how students engage with Scratch, with some studies indicating that girls and students from under-resourced backgrounds may require additional support to fully benefit from the platform [2; 6]. Future research should focus on developing more inclusive and adaptive learning strategies to ensure that all students can benefit from the motivational power of Scratch.

### 5.5 Assessment and Evaluation of Computational Thinking in Scratch

Assessment and evaluation of computational thinking (CT) in Scratch environments have become critical areas of empirical research, reflecting the growing need for reliable tools to measure the effectiveness of CT learning. Various approaches have been developed to evaluate CT skills, including manual assessments, automated testing frameworks, and AI-driven evaluation systems, each with distinct strengths and limitations. This subsection provides an overview of these methods, analyzing their application, effectiveness, and challenges in Scratch-based CT education.

One of the foundational approaches involves the use of rubrics and competency-based assessment models tailored for block-based programming environments. The "competent Computational Thinking test" (cCTt) [41] is a notable example, designed to evaluate CT skills in 7–9-year-old students. The test utilizes a combination of classical test theory, item response theory, and confirmatory factor analysis to ensure psychometric validity and reliability. Similarly, the "ACE" test [44] focuses on the higher-order cognitive levels of Bloom's Taxonomy—Analyze, Evaluate, and Create—using multi-choice items grounded in block-based visual programming. These assessments provide structured frameworks for evaluating CT skills, yet they face limitations in capturing the creative and open-ended aspects of Scratch programming.

Automated testing frameworks, such as Whisker [33] and the "virtual CAT" [52], offer more dynamic and scalable approaches. Whisker enables the generation of automated tests for Scratch programs by analyzing program behavior and deriving test cases based on state-machine models, which helps mitigate the challenges of randomization and variability in game-like projects. The virtual CAT, designed for algorithmic thinking assessment in Swiss compulsory education, employs gesture-based and visual block-based interfaces to assess students’ problem-solving abilities. These automated tools are effective in large-scale assessments but often struggle to evaluate the nuanced, creative, and non-deterministic aspects of CT.

In recent years, AI and machine learning have introduced innovative avenues for CT assessment. Tools like ChatScratch [42] and AI-based coding assistants provide real-time feedback and guidance, helping learners refine their problem-solving strategies. Similarly, the "Rubric-based Learner Modelling via Noisy Gates Bayesian Networks" [53] model learner progress using probabilistic networks, incorporating both task-specific competencies and supplementary skills. These AI-enhanced approaches offer personalized and adaptive feedback but raise concerns about over-reliance on automated systems and the potential erosion of human judgment in assessment.

While significant progress has been made, challenges persist. Issues such as the lack of standardized CT definitions, the difficulty of capturing creativity and open-ended thinking, and the need for inclusive and equitable assessment frameworks remain. Future research should focus on developing more holistic assessment tools that integrate both quantitative and qualitative dimensions of CT, leveraging emerging technologies while ensuring accessibility and fairness.

### 5.6 Challenges and Limitations in Measuring CT Outcomes with Scratch

Measuring computational thinking (CT) outcomes in Scratch presents a complex set of challenges and limitations, stemming from both methodological constraints and practical barriers. While Scratch has been widely recognized for its effectiveness in fostering CT skills through its visual and interactive design, the nature of block-based programming introduces unique difficulties in assessing the depth and breadth of these skills. One of the primary methodological challenges lies in the definition and operationalization of CT itself. Despite considerable research on CT, there remains a lack of consensus on a unified framework for measuring CT skills, particularly in block-based environments [54]. This ambiguity complicates the development of standardized assessment tools that can reliably capture the diverse ways in which students engage with CT in Scratch.

Another key limitation is the difficulty in capturing the nuanced, creative, and problem-solving aspects of CT through traditional assessment methods. Many existing assessments focus on correctness and syntactic accuracy, which do not fully reflect the cognitive processes involved in CT. For example, while tools like LitterBox and NuzzleBug provide automated feedback on code errors, they often overlook the higher-order thinking processes that underpin effective problem-solving [12]. This gap highlights the need for more sophisticated assessment methodologies that can evaluate the quality of students' reasoning, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking in Scratch-based projects.

Moreover, the open-ended and exploratory nature of Scratch projects presents practical challenges for empirical research. Unlike structured programming tasks, Scratch projects often involve a wide range of problem-solving approaches and creative expressions, making it difficult to design assessments that are both comprehensive and scalable. This variability can lead to inconsistencies in data collection and interpretation, particularly in large-scale studies [29]. Additionally, the reliance on self-reported data and qualitative measures, such as student reflections and teacher observations, introduces subjectivity and potential bias in the evaluation of CT outcomes.

The limitations of automated assessment tools further complicate the measurement of CT outcomes in Scratch. While emerging technologies, such as AI and machine learning, offer promising avenues for enhancing feedback mechanisms and personalized learning, they also raise concerns about the reliability and interpretability of automated assessments [55]. For instance, tools like GPT-4 have shown potential in providing feedback on student code, but their ability to capture the subtleties of CT remains unproven [56]. This highlights the need for continued research into the development of more accurate and context-aware assessment tools.

Finally, the challenges of equipping educators with the necessary training and resources to effectively assess CT in Scratch must be addressed. Many teachers lack the pedagogical and technical expertise to implement and interpret CT assessments, leading to underutilization of available tools and methods [35]. As Scratch continues to play a central role in CT education, overcoming these methodological and practical barriers will be essential to ensuring that empirical research on CT outcomes is both meaningful and impactful.

## 6 Challenges and Limitations in Scratch-Based Computational Thinking Education

### 6.1 Technical Constraints and Scalability Issues

Scratch, while an influential platform for introducing computational thinking (CT) to beginners, faces several technical constraints and scalability issues that limit its effectiveness in more advanced educational contexts. One of the primary limitations is its restricted scalability for complex projects. Scratch is fundamentally designed for small-scale, introductory tasks, which makes it less suitable for projects requiring advanced computational structures, such as distributed systems, real-time data processing, or large-scale simulations [1]. This limitation becomes particularly evident when students progress beyond the initial stages of programming and encounter challenges that require more sophisticated abstractions, such as memory management, concurrency, or object-oriented design. As a result, Scratch struggles to support the evolving needs of learners who aim to transition to more advanced programming paradigms.

Another critical issue lies in the transition from block-based to text-based programming. While Scratch excels at reducing syntactic barriers for beginners, it lacks direct support for transitioning to text-based languages such as Python, Java, or C++. This creates a significant gap in the learning trajectory for students who wish to advance their programming skills [1]. The absence of built-in tools or seamless integration with text-based environments limits the ability of learners to apply their block-based knowledge in more complex, real-world programming scenarios. Furthermore, the lack of a direct mapping between Scratch blocks and corresponding code in text-based languages complicates the conceptual transfer of programming logic, leading to potential confusion and learning stagnation.

Scratch also exhibits inadequate support for advanced computational concepts such as recursion, parallel processing, and algorithm optimization. Its block-based interface, while effective for introducing fundamental CT skills like decomposition and pattern recognition, does not adequately represent the abstract and recursive nature of these advanced concepts [1]. As a result, learners who engage with Scratch may struggle to grasp the deeper theoretical underpinnings of computational thinking required for higher-level problem-solving tasks. This limitation is particularly relevant in educational settings that aim to develop not just basic programming skills, but a comprehensive understanding of computational systems.

Moreover, Scratch’s current toolset does not provide sufficient support for real-time feedback, advanced debugging, or collaboration features that are essential for more complex learning environments [1]. While initiatives like LitterBox and NuzzleBug offer some automated feedback capabilities, they remain limited in scope and depth. The absence of robust debugging tools and collaborative editing features further hinders the platform’s ability to support team-based and project-driven learning, which are critical components of modern computational thinking education.

Despite these challenges, Scratch remains a valuable tool for introducing CT, particularly in early education. However, its technical constraints highlight the need for more advanced extensions and hybrid learning environments that bridge the gap between block-based and text-based programming. Future developments should focus on enhancing Scratch’s scalability, improving transitions to text-based languages, and incorporating more sophisticated computational features to support a broader range of educational goals. Such improvements would ensure that Scratch continues to serve as an effective and inclusive platform for computational thinking education across diverse learner needs.

### 6.2 Pedagogical and Curriculum Integration Barriers

The integration of Scratch into formal educational settings presents significant pedagogical and curriculum-related challenges that hinder its effective implementation. One of the primary issues is the mismatch between Scratch’s open-ended, exploratory nature and the structured, standardized approaches that dominate traditional educational frameworks [14]. While Scratch fosters creativity and experimentation, it often conflicts with curricular objectives that emphasize measurable learning outcomes, standardized assessments, and linear progression of skills. This tension is further exacerbated by the absence of well-defined pedagogical models that align Scratch with existing educational standards, making it difficult for educators to justify its use within formal curricula [27].

Another critical barrier is the lack of specialized teacher training. Many educators lack the pedagogical and technical expertise required to effectively incorporate Scratch into their instruction, leading to underutilization or improper implementation of the platform [35]. This gap is particularly evident in regions where computational thinking is not yet a core component of the curriculum, as teachers may not have the necessary background or resources to integrate Scratch meaningfully into their lessons. Moreover, the absence of comprehensive teacher development programs limits the capacity of educators to adapt Scratch-based activities to different learning contexts and student needs [57].

Assessment and evaluation also represent significant challenges. There is a lack of standardized and reliable assessment tools to measure computational thinking skills developed through Scratch, making it difficult to evaluate student progress and learning outcomes [14]. Traditional assessment methods often fail to capture the nuanced, creative, and iterative nature of learning in Scratch, which emphasizes problem-solving, collaboration, and experimentation. As a result, educators struggle to design assessments that accurately reflect the skills and competencies students develop through Scratch-based projects [40].

Furthermore, the integration of Scratch into the curriculum requires a rethinking of existing pedagogical approaches. While Scratch provides a powerful platform for fostering computational thinking, its effectiveness depends on the instructional strategies used to support learning. This necessitates a shift from traditional, content-driven instruction to more student-centered, inquiry-based models that align with the exploratory and collaborative nature of Scratch [58]. However, such a shift requires substantial changes in teacher roles, classroom dynamics, and assessment practices, which can be challenging to implement in resource-constrained environments [59].

In conclusion, the pedagogical and curriculum integration barriers associated with Scratch highlight the need for systemic changes in educational practices, teacher training, and assessment methodologies. Addressing these challenges requires a coordinated effort among educators, policymakers, and researchers to develop more flexible, inclusive, and effective frameworks for integrating computational thinking into formal education. Future research should focus on creating adaptive pedagogical models, enhancing teacher training programs, and developing robust assessment tools that reflect the unique learning outcomes of Scratch-based instruction [59; 14].

### 6.3 Equity and Accessibility Concerns

Scratch-based computational thinking education, while promising in its ability to democratize programming and foster creativity, faces significant equity and accessibility challenges that hinder its potential to benefit all learners. These concerns stem from a complex interplay of socioeconomic, geographic, and technological barriers that limit access to the tools, resources, and support necessary for effective computational thinking instruction. Addressing these challenges is critical to ensuring that Scratch fulfills its potential as an inclusive educational tool.  

One of the primary equity concerns is the digital divide, which exacerbates disparities in access to computational learning opportunities. Students from low-income backgrounds often lack the necessary devices, reliable internet connections, and software infrastructure to engage meaningfully with Scratch. This creates a situation where computational thinking education becomes a privilege rather than a universal right, disproportionately affecting underrepresented groups [29]. Furthermore, the reliance on digital infrastructure means that students in remote or rural areas face additional challenges, including limited access to technical support and training. These geographic and socioeconomic disparities underscore the need for policy interventions and infrastructure investments to ensure that all students have equitable access to computational education.  

Another critical issue is the inclusivity of Scratch's design for diverse learners. While Scratch is lauded for its user-friendly block-based interface, it may not fully accommodate the needs of students with disabilities or those who require alternative learning modalities. For example, the visual and interactive nature of Scratch may not be optimal for learners with visual impairments, and the platform's text-based elements may pose challenges for those with reading difficulties [16]. Moreover, the predominance of English as the primary language of the Scratch interface and resources presents a barrier for non-English speaking students, limiting the platform's global reach and effectiveness in multilingual settings [29]. These limitations highlight the need for more adaptive and inclusive design approaches to ensure that Scratch is accessible to a broader range of learners.  

In addition to these structural barriers, there are pedagogical and curricular challenges that impact the effectiveness of Scratch-based learning. Many educators, particularly in under-resourced schools, lack the training and support needed to integrate Scratch into their teaching effectively [60]. This gap in teacher preparation can lead to underutilization of the platform and a lack of alignment with broader educational goals. Moreover, the absence of standardized assessments for computational thinking in block-based environments complicates efforts to evaluate student progress and ensure that all learners benefit from Scratch-based instruction [41].  

To address these challenges, future research and development must focus on creating more inclusive and adaptable tools, expanding teacher training programs, and advocating for policies that promote equitable access to digital learning resources. By doing so, Scratch can continue to serve as a powerful platform for computational thinking education that is accessible, inclusive, and effective for all learners.

### 6.4 Cognitive and Developmental Challenges

The cognitive and developmental challenges associated with Scratch-based computational thinking education are multifaceted, reflecting the interplay between the platform's visual, block-based design and the complex cognitive processes required for deeper computational reasoning. While Scratch's intuitive interface is instrumental in engaging young learners, it also presents limitations in fostering advanced problem-solving strategies and abstract thinking. Research indicates that the visual nature of Scratch may lead to an over-reliance on concrete, representational thinking, potentially hindering the development of more abstract and systematic reasoning skills [2]. This is particularly evident in the transition from block-based to text-based programming, where students may struggle to grasp the syntax and semantics of traditional programming languages due to the lack of direct exposure to these elements in Scratch [6].

One significant challenge is the limited support for structured problem-solving strategies within Scratch. Although the platform encourages creativity and exploration, it often lacks the scaffolding necessary to guide learners through complex problem decomposition, algorithm design, and debugging processes [1]. This can result in unstructured learning experiences, where students may focus more on the aesthetic and creative aspects of their projects rather than the underlying computational logic. Studies have shown that learners who rely heavily on Scratch's visual interface may find it difficult to develop the analytical and logical thinking required for more advanced computational tasks [2].

Moreover, the open-ended nature of Scratch projects can lead to a lack of systematic approaches to problem-solving. While creativity is a valuable component of computational thinking, an overemphasis on creative freedom without sufficient guidance can result in fragmented learning experiences. This is supported by empirical evidence showing that students who engage in unstructured Scratch projects often struggle to apply computational thinking concepts effectively in real-world contexts [1]. To address this, educators must balance creativity with structured learning, ensuring that students develop a comprehensive understanding of computational principles while still fostering their creative expression.

The cognitive load associated with Scratch's design also presents a challenge. Although the block-based interface reduces the cognitive burden of syntax, it may not fully support the development of deeper computational reasoning skills. For instance, learners may not fully grasp the implications of their code's structure or the logic behind their algorithms, as the visual blocks can obscure the underlying computational processes [1]. This highlights the need for additional scaffolding tools and pedagogical strategies that help learners bridge the gap between visual and abstract thinking.

In conclusion, while Scratch is an effective tool for introducing computational thinking, it is essential to recognize and address the cognitive and developmental challenges it presents. Future research and pedagogical innovations should focus on developing strategies that enhance structured problem-solving, deepen computational reasoning, and support the transition to more advanced programming paradigms. By doing so, educators can ensure that Scratch-based learning environments not only engage students but also prepare them for the complexities of computational thinking in the broader educational landscape [1].

### 6.5 Tool and Platform Limitations

Scratch, while widely recognized for its role in fostering computational thinking (CT) in educational settings, is not without its limitations as a tool and platform. These constraints are particularly evident in areas such as advanced debugging, collaboration, and real-time feedback, which are critical for effective CT development. As the demand for more sophisticated CT learning experiences grows, the need to address these limitations becomes increasingly urgent.

One of the most significant tool-related limitations of Scratch is its lack of advanced debugging capabilities. While Scratch’s block-based interface minimizes syntax errors, it does not provide learners with robust debugging tools that can help identify and resolve logical errors. This limitation is particularly problematic for students who are transitioning from Scratch to text-based programming, as they may struggle with debugging techniques that are more complex and nuanced. Research has highlighted the importance of debugging in CT development, with studies indicating that the ability to identify and fix errors is a fundamental skill for computational thinkers [12]. Tools like LitterBox and NuzzleBug have been developed to address this issue, but they remain supplementary rather than integrated features of the platform.

Collaboration, while a core feature of Scratch through its online community, is still limited in terms of real-time interaction and shared project editing. While users can remix projects and engage in peer learning, the platform lacks advanced collaboration features that would enable simultaneous editing, version control, and more dynamic group project management. This limitation hinders the development of collaborative CT practices, which are essential for fostering teamwork and shared problem-solving in educational settings [27]. The need for enhanced collaboration tools is further underscored by studies that emphasize the role of peer interaction in deepening CT understanding and promoting social learning [45].

Another critical limitation is the insufficient support for real-time feedback and assessment. While Scratch offers some formative feedback through its interactive environment, it lacks automated and structured assessment mechanisms that can provide immediate, actionable insights into students' CT development. This gap is particularly evident in larger classrooms, where teachers may struggle to provide individualized feedback on complex projects. Recent innovations, such as the Whisker framework for automated testing and the integration of AI-assisted tools like ChatScratch, demonstrate promising directions for improving feedback mechanisms [12; 19]. However, these solutions are still in their early stages and are not yet fully integrated into the platform.

Moreover, Scratch’s design, while beneficial for beginner learners, may not adequately support the development of deeper computational reasoning skills. The emphasis on visual and concrete thinking can lead to an over-reliance on the platform’s interface, potentially limiting students’ ability to transition to more abstract programming concepts [61]. This highlights the need for a more balanced approach that integrates advanced CT skills into Scratch-based learning while maintaining its accessibility and intuitive design.

Addressing these limitations requires ongoing research and development to enhance Scratch’s features and adapt it to the evolving needs of CT education. Future work should focus on integrating advanced debugging tools, improving collaboration mechanisms, and developing more comprehensive assessment strategies. These improvements will not only enhance the user experience but also strengthen the effectiveness of Scratch as a platform for fostering computational thinking.

### 7.4 Inclusive and Adaptive Learning Environments for Scratch-Based CT

Inclusive and adaptive learning environments are essential for ensuring that Scratch-based computational thinking (CT) education reaches all learners, regardless of their abilities, backgrounds, or learning needs. As computational thinking becomes a foundational skill in education, the need for equitable access to learning tools like Scratch has never been more critical. Current research emphasizes the importance of designing environments that accommodate diverse learners, incorporating features that support accessibility, cultural relevance, and personalized learning pathways [1; 1]. This subsection explores the current state of inclusive and adaptive learning in Scratch-based CT, highlighting emerging innovations and persistent challenges.

A key focus of inclusive design in Scratch is accessibility for learners with disabilities. While Scratch’s block-based interface already provides a level of accessibility, there is a growing need to integrate more robust features such as assistive technologies, customizable interfaces, and support for alternative input methods [1]. Recent initiatives, such as the development of Scratch Community Blocks [2], demonstrate how data-driven tools can be adapted to support learners with diverse needs, allowing them to analyze and visualize their own learning data in meaningful ways. However, much work remains to be done in ensuring that these features are universally accessible and effectively integrated into educational practice.

Adaptive learning environments further enhance inclusivity by tailoring instructional experiences to individual student needs. Research has shown that personalized learning pathways, supported by AI-driven systems, can significantly improve CT outcomes for students with varying levels of prior experience and learning styles [1; 1]. Tools like ChatScratch [64] exemplify this trend, offering natural language-based support that reduces cognitive barriers for young learners. Similarly, the integration of AI-assisted debugging tools such as LitterBox [3] provides targeted feedback that supports learners in developing more sophisticated problem-solving skills. However, while these innovations hold promise, they also raise questions about data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for over-reliance on automated systems.

Another critical aspect of inclusive CT education is the need for culturally responsive and linguistically inclusive curricula. Studies have highlighted how Scratch projects often reflect gender and cultural biases, with girls and non-English speaking learners engaging less frequently with the platform [1; 1]. Addressing this requires a shift toward more inclusive content creation, the development of multilingual interfaces, and the incorporation of diverse perspectives in CT pedagogy. Initiatives such as the development of the competent Computational Thinking test (cCTt) [1] provide a framework for assessing CT in a manner that is sensitive to the cultural and linguistic backgrounds of learners.

Looking ahead, the future of inclusive and adaptive Scratch-based CT education will depend on continued innovation in AI integration, accessibility design, and curriculum development. As generative AI tools become more sophisticated, their role in supporting personalized learning and reducing barriers to CT education will expand. However, this must be accompanied by rigorous evaluation of their impact on student learning and the development of ethical guidelines for their use. Ultimately, the goal is to create learning environments that are not only technically advanced but also socially and culturally inclusive, ensuring that all learners can benefit from the transformative potential of computational thinking.

### 7.5 Cross-Disciplinary and Interdisciplinary Applications of Scratch in CT
