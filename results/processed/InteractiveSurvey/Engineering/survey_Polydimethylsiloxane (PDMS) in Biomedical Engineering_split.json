For instance, strain relaxation in GeSn membranes leads to a redshift in the cutoff wavelength, extending the operational range of mid-infrared detectors. This effect is closely tied to the modification of band structures and the redistribution of strain within the material, which in turn influences carrier mobility and optical absorption characteristics. Such mechanical and strain-induced effects are essential for optimizing device performance in optoelectronic and photonic applications.\n\nThe interplay between mechanical deformation and material response is further complicated by the presence of defects, interfaces, and alloy disorder. Strain engineering, when combined with precise control over epitaxial layer stacks, enables the tuning of valley states and enhances quantum coherence in two-dimensional systems. Theoretical models, such as multi-valley envelope function theory and nonlocal empirical pseudopotential approaches, provide insights into how strain and alloy composition affect electronic properties. These models are crucial for predicting and optimizing the behavior of strain-relaxed materials, particularly in systems where the interplay between strain, composition, and quantum confinement leads to complex material responses.\n\nIn addition to electronic effects, mechanical strain can induce microstructural changes, such as lattice distortion and defect generation, which influence long-term stability and reliability. Techniques like Grazing-Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GiXRD) are employed to characterize residual stresses and their evolution during fabrication [1].

The complexity of these phenomena necessitates the use of advanced theoretical frameworks, including the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, which provides a rigorous quantum mechanical description of transport processes. This approach enables the calculation of current-voltage characteristics, carrier distribution functions, and energy dissipation mechanisms in nanoscale devices, making it a cornerstone for the design and optimization of next-generation optoelectronic and quantum devices.\n\nThe integration of time-dependent and spatially varying potentials into transport models is particularly important for systems where dynamic interactions dominate.

This design enhances mode confinement through stronger coupling between adjacent corrugations, which is crucial for maintaining signal integrity and reducing crosstalk. The dispersion characteristics of this waveguide, as illustrated in Fig. 2, show significantly improved confinement compared to conventional microstriplines, particularly on FR4 and silicon substrates. This enhanced confinement is essential for high-performance applications where signal integrity and noise immunity are paramount.\n\nThe engineering of periodic waveguides further expands the possibilities for dispersion control and mode manipulation [10]. These structures can exhibit properties akin to exotic materials, offering tailored electromagnetic responses across a wide frequency range. The Floquet-Bloch dispersion relation of the waveguide presented here features a cubic dependence near the SIP, leading to a group delay scaling of $ N^3 $ for resonances around the SIP frequency [10]. This behavior enables unique temporal characteristics that can be leveraged in applications such as delay lines and pulse shaping. The ability to engineer such dispersion properties through periodicity opens new avenues for designing waveguides with customized propagation characteristics [10].\n\nResonator design complements waveguide engineering by enabling precise control over electromagnetic field distribution and resonance frequencies.
