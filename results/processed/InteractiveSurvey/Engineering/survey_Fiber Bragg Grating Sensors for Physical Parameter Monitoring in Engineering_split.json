Traditional DNNs often lack the ability to express confidence in their predictions, which can lead to unreliable decision-making in uncertain environments. To address this, various techniques have been developed to estimate both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Aleatoric uncertainty captures inherent noise in the data, while epistemic uncertainty reflects model uncertainty due to limited or noisy training data. These methods are essential for applications where reliable predictions and robustness to unseen data are paramount, such as in real-time control or autonomous systems.\n\nRecent advancements in uncertainty quantification include Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), Monte Carlo Dropout, and ensemble methods, which provide probabilistic outputs and quantify model confidence. These approaches enable DNNs to not only make predictions but also assess the reliability of those predictions. For instance, Monte Carlo Dropout introduces stochasticity during inference to approximate Bayesian posterior distributions, allowing for uncertainty estimation without significant computational overhead. Such techniques are particularly valuable in scenarios where model misspecification or data scarcity is a concern, as they provide a more nuanced understanding of prediction reliability compared to deterministic models.\n\nIn the context of robotic systems, uncertainty quantification plays a pivotal role in enhancing safety and adaptability. By incorporating uncertainty estimates into decision-making processes, robots can better handle unpredictable environments and avoid erroneous actions. This is especially relevant in applications such as surgical robotics, where precise and reliable predictions are crucial.

The integration of such models with edge-FBG sensors offers a promising alternative to conventional methods that rely on simplified assumptions about strain distribution [7].\n\nThe application of supervised learning in edge-FBG shape sensing typically involves training models on datasets generated from controlled experiments or simulations. These datasets are often constructed by subjecting the sensor to known deformations and recording the corresponding spectral responses. Feature extraction and preprocessing steps are critical to ensure the model can effectively learn from the data.

These networks consist of two or more identical subnetworks that share weights and process input pairs in parallel, enabling the model to learn a similarity metric between the inputs. In the context of robotic sensing and contact detection, Siamese networks are employed to distinguish between different states or conditions based on sensory data. By training the network to recognize subtle differences in feature representations, such as those derived from whisker-object interactions or fiber Bragg grating (FBG) signals, the model can effectively classify events like collisions or environmental contacts. This approach is particularly advantageous in situations where labeled data is scarce, as it leverages the structure of the input data to learn discriminative features without explicit supervision.\n\nThe application of Siamese networks in this domain involves careful design of the feature extraction module, which is typically a deep neural network tailored to the specific sensory modality. For instance, in the case of whisker contact tracking, the network may process time-series data from tactile sensors, while for FBG-based systems, it may analyze spectral signatures. The shared architecture of the Siamese network ensures that the same feature extractor is applied consistently to both inputs, promoting invariance to variations in the input data. This is crucial for maintaining robustness in real-world scenarios where environmental conditions and sensor noise can significantly affect the signal. Furthermore, the use of contrastive loss functions during training allows the network to optimize the distance between feature embeddings, thereby enhancing the model's ability to differentiate between similar but distinct input patterns.\n\nIn the context of robotic shape estimation and contact detection, Siamese networks offer a flexible and scalable solution for feature discrimination. By leveraging the learned similarity metric, these networks can be integrated into real-time systems for applications such as collision avoidance, object recognition, and environmental mapping. The ability to generalize across different sensor configurations and operating conditions makes Siamese networks a valuable tool in data-driven approaches to robotic perception. Their effectiveness in capturing complex, nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs further underscores their relevance in modern machine learning applications within robotics and sensor systems.",

This approach enables high-resolution strain and curvature measurements along the length of a soft manipulator, facilitating real-time shape reconstruction without relying on kinematic models [9]. The use of OFDR-based sensors is particularly advantageous in environments where electromagnetic interference is a concern, as optical fibers are immune to such disturbances. This makes OFDR a suitable candidate for integration into flexible surgical instruments that operate in sensitive biomedical settings.\n\nOFDR-based shape sensing works by analyzing the backscattered light from an optical fiber to infer local strain variations, which are then used to reconstruct the three-dimensional shape of the manipulator. The technique allows for continuous monitoring of the entire length of the robot, providing detailed information about its configuration in real time. This is crucial for applications where precise control and feedback are required, such as in delicate surgical procedures. Additionally, OFDR's ability to detect small curvature changes with high sensitivity makes it well-suited for applications involving complex, tortuous paths. The method also supports the integration of multiple sensing points along a single fiber, enhancing spatial resolution and enabling more accurate shape estimation. These features make OFDR-based shape sensing a compelling alternative to conventional sensor arrangements in soft robotic systems.\n\nDespite its advantages, OFDR-based shape sensing still faces challenges in terms of signal processing complexity and the need for robust calibration procedures.

The layout of FBG sensors plays a critical role in determining the sensitivity and accuracy of force detection, as the placement and orientation of the gratings influence the measurement of strain and curvature [15]. By strategically positioning FBG pairs on perpendicular surfaces of a robotic component, such as a prong or gripper, the system can capture multi-axis force information. This approach enables the detection of both the magnitude and direction of applied forces, which is essential for tasks requiring precise control and interaction with delicate environments. The design of the FBG layout must also consider the mechanical behavior of the host structure to ensure reliable signal acquisition.\n\nDecoupling sensor signals is a crucial step in achieving accurate force perception, as multiple physical phenomena—such as bending, stretching, and torsion—can simultaneously affect the FBG measurements. A simplified model for curvature computation and force estimation is derived to address this challenge, allowing for faster and more efficient processing of sensor data. This model accounts for the relationship between axial strain and curvature, enabling the separation of force-induced strain from other mechanical effects. Experimental validation on single, double, and triple force cases demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately estimating force magnitude and location. The results highlight the importance of signal decoupling in improving the reliability of FBG-based force sensing in complex robotic systems.\n\nThe integration of FBG sensors within flexible robotic structures presents unique challenges, particularly in maintaining high sensitivity while minimizing interference from unwanted mechanical deformations [9]. Traditional FBG-based sensors often suffer from limitations such as poor decoupling of bending and force effects, leading to reduced accuracy [5]. To overcome these issues, novel designs have been proposed, including the suspension of the FBG fiber within a chamber to allow direct interaction with the applied force. This configuration enhances the sensitivity and robustness of the sensor, making it suitable for applications in surgical robotics and other safety-critical environments. The development of advanced signal processing techniques further supports the decoupling process, ensuring that the measured data reflects the true force conditions.
