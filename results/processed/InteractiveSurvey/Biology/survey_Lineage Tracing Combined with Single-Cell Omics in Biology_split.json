Traditional methods of studying cell fate and lineage have been limited by the inability to track individual cells over time and correlate their genetic and phenotypic states. With the advent of high-throughput single-cell sequencing and advanced imaging technologies, researchers can now reconstruct detailed lineage trees while simultaneously analyzing gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and other molecular features. This convergence of methodologies has enabled the study of complex biological processes, such as embryonic development, tissue regeneration, and cancer progression, at an unprecedented level of resolution. The ability to map the dynamic interplay between lineage and molecular states has opened new avenues for uncovering the regulatory mechanisms that govern cellular identity and function.\n\nThis survey paper focuses on the integration of lineage tracing with single-cell omics, with an emphasis on biophysical modeling, computational approaches, and deep learning techniques [1]. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the methodologies, challenges, and recent advancements in this rapidly evolving field. By examining the interplay between experimental data and computational models, this paper aims to highlight how lineage tracing can be enhanced through the application of biophysical principles and machine learning algorithms [1]. The discussion spans a range of topics, including the study of cell motion and diffusion, the use of nuclease-based barcoding for lineage mapping, and the application of deep learning for cell tracking and lineage inference. This survey serves as a foundation for understanding the current state of the field and identifying future research directions.\n\nThe paper begins with an exploration of biophysical modeling of cell dynamics, focusing on the analysis of anomalous diffusion and caging behavior in embryonic tissues [2]. These phenomena provide insights into the mechanical properties of tissues and their proximity to a glass transition, which has significant implications for developmental biology [2]. The discussion then extends to the integration of computational fluid dynamics with experimental validation of microorganism motion, demonstrating how theoretical models can be refined through empirical data. The section on lineage tracing and genetic barcoding addresses the use of nuclease-based techniques for long-term lineage mapping, as well as entropy-based analysis for quantifying epigenetic regulation.

      "content": "Cell trajectories in embryonic tissues exhibit distinct patterns of motion that deviate from classical Brownian diffusion, characterized by anomalous diffusion and caging behavior. These phenomena are indicative of glassy dynamics, where the movement of cells becomes increasingly restricted due to the complex, heterogeneous environment of the tissue [2]. Anomalous diffusion is observed as a deviation from the linear scaling of mean squared displacement with time, often manifesting as subdiffusive behavior. Caging behavior, on the other hand, refers to the temporary confinement of cells within a local region, suggesting interactions with neighboring cells or structural constraints within the tissue matrix. Such behaviors are critical in understanding the mechanical and dynamic properties of developing tissues.\n\nThe presence of glassy dynamics in embryonic tissues implies that the system's relaxation timescale is influenced by its proximity to a glass transition [2]. This concept, originally derived from soft matter physics, suggests that as a system approaches a critical point, its dynamics slow down significantly. In the context of embryonic tissues, this could mean that the viscoelastic properties of the tissue are governed by the same principles that dictate the behavior of glass-forming materials [2]. By analyzing cell trajectories, researchers can infer the degree to which the tissue is approaching this critical state, providing insights into the underlying physical mechanisms that regulate tissue development and morphogenesis.\n\nTo quantify these effects, a framework is required to assess the distance of the system to a glass transition. This involves characterizing the statistical properties of cell motion, such as the distribution of waiting times and the nature of displacements. By linking these microscale observations to macroscopic viscoelastic properties, it becomes possible to predict how tissue mechanics influence developmental processes. This approach not only enhances our understanding of embryonic tissue dynamics but also opens new avenues for modeling and manipulating tissue behavior in both developmental and regenerative contexts.",

      "content": "The integration of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with experimental validation of microorganism motion has emerged as a critical approach for understanding the complex interactions between microorganisms and their fluid environments. CFD models simulate the hydrodynamic forces and flow fields experienced by microorganisms, enabling the prediction of their movement patterns under various conditions. These simulations are often validated through high-resolution experimental techniques such as particle image velocimetry (PIV) and high-speed microscopy, which provide empirical data on actual microorganism trajectories and fluid dynamics. This synergy allows researchers to test hypotheses about the influence of viscosity, flow gradients, and boundary effects on microbial motility, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and real-world observations.\n\nExperimental validation plays a pivotal role in refining CFD models by identifying discrepancies between simulated and observed behaviors. For instance, discrepancies in predicted versus measured swimming speeds or trajectory deviations can indicate the need for more accurate representations of microorganism morphology, flagellar dynamics, or fluid-structure interactions. Additionally, the incorporation of stochastic elements in CFD simulations, such as random fluctuations in receptor signaling or environmental noise, enhances the realism of the models. These refinements are essential for capturing the nuanced behaviors of microorganisms, such as chemotaxis, where small changes in fluid flow can significantly impact directional movement and navigation.\n\nThe combined use of CFD and experimental validation also facilitates the study of collective microorganism behavior, such as biofilm formation or swarming, where individual interactions with the fluid environment contribute to macroscopic patterns. By integrating these approaches, researchers can explore how microscale fluid dynamics influence large-scale biological processes. This integration not only improves the accuracy of predictive models but also provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing microorganism motion, paving the way for applications in biotechnology, medicine, and environmental science.",

      "content": "Nuclease-based barcoding has emerged as a powerful technique for long-term cellular lineage mapping, leveraging the precision of enzymatic DNA cleavage to generate unique genetic identifiers within cells. This approach typically involves the use of site-specific nucleases, such as CRISPR-Cas9 or TALENs, to introduce targeted mutations or insertions in a cell's genome. These modifications act as molecular barcodes, which can be inherited through cell divisions and used to trace lineage relationships over multiple generations. The ability to introduce and propagate these barcodes enables researchers to reconstruct complex cellular histories, even in heterogeneous populations, providing insights into developmental processes and clonal dynamics.\n\nThe key advantage of nuclease-based barcoding lies in its scalability and compatibility with high-throughput sequencing technologies, allowing for the simultaneous tracking of thousands of cells. By integrating barcoding with single-cell RNA sequencing, it becomes possible to correlate lineage information with gene expression profiles, offering a comprehensive view of cellular identity and fate decisions [1]. However, challenges remain in ensuring uniform barcode incorporation, minimizing off-target effects, and maintaining the stability of barcodes over extended periods. These factors influence the accuracy and resolution of lineage reconstruction, necessitating careful optimization of the barcoding strategy and experimental design.\n\nRecent advancements have focused on improving the efficiency and specificity of nuclease-based barcoding, including the development of multiplexed systems that enable the generation of combinatorial barcodes. Such innovations enhance the resolution of lineage tracing, making it feasible to study complex biological systems such as embryonic development, tumor progression, and regenerative processes. As the technology matures, nuclease-based barcoding is expected to play an increasingly central role in elucidating the dynamic relationships between cellular lineage, gene regulation, and functional outcomes.",

This approach leverages the Shannon entropy of lineage trees to identify statistical signatures of epigenetic changes, particularly those leading to inactivity [3]. By analyzing high-resolution lineage-tracing data, it becomes possible to distinguish between hereditary and non-hereditary lineages based on their entropy values, which reflect the complexity and predictability of cellular differentiation. This method enables the identification of specific points in the lineage where epigenetic modifications occur, offering insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular memory and fate determination.\n\nThe entropy-based analysis is grounded in the concept of a 'state manifold' that captures the multi-dimensional space of cell states, including transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolic profiles. By integrating single-cell profiling techniques with lineage tracing, the entropy of lineage topologies can be calculated to reveal how epigenetic states propagate through generations. This approach allows for the mapping of epigenetic changes upstream in the lineage, providing a detailed view of how cellular memory is encoded and transmitted. The reduction in entropy observed in hereditary lineages suggests a constrained developmental trajectory, indicative of stable epigenetic states that persist across cell divisions [3].\n\nThis methodology bridges the gap between experimental observations and theoretical models of cell fate by linking entropy measures to the dynamics of gene regulatory networks [4]. It provides a framework for quantifying the hereditary character of inactivity and other epigenetic traits, offering a novel perspective on how cellular states are maintained and altered over time [3].

      "content": "The study of glassy dynamics and jamming transitions in biological tissues has emerged as a critical area of research, offering insights into the mechanical behavior of cell assemblies [2]. In confluent tissues, where cells are densely packed and their movement is restricted, the system exhibits characteristics akin to supercooled liquids or glasses, such as slow relaxation and caging effects. These features suggest that the tissue's mechanical response is governed by the proximity to a jamming transition, a concept borrowed from soft matter physics. Understanding such dynamics is essential for elucidating how tissues maintain structural integrity and respond to external stresses, particularly during development and disease.\n\nJamming transitions in biological tissues are often associated with the interplay between cell motility, adhesion, and mechanical constraints. As cells attempt to rearrange within a confined space, their motion becomes increasingly hindered, leading to a transition from a fluid-like to a solid-like state. This phenomenon is closely linked to the concept of the glass transition, where the system's relaxation time diverges as it approaches a critical density. In tissues, this transition can be influenced by factors such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and the extracellular matrix, which collectively modulate the mechanical properties of the tissue.\n\nRecent studies have explored the connection between glassy dynamics and tissue mechanics by analyzing cell trajectories and stress distributions [2]. These investigations reveal that tissues near the jamming transition exhibit anomalous diffusion and long-lived correlations, similar to those observed in model glass-forming materials. By developing quantitative frameworks to measure the distance to the jamming point, researchers aim to predict and control tissue behavior under various physiological and pathological conditions. Such insights hold significant implications for understanding tissue morphogenesis, wound healing, and cancer progression.",

These models aim to capture the complex interplay between the elastic and viscous responses of biological tissues, which are essential for understanding processes such as tissue development, wound healing, and cellular rearrangements [2]. By integrating principles from continuum mechanics and statistical physics, researchers have formulated frameworks that describe the time-dependent deformation of cell clusters under external forces. Such models typically incorporate parameters that reflect the intrinsic material properties of cells, including their stiffness, viscosity, and adhesion strength, which are crucial for predicting how cells respond to mechanical stimuli.\n\nCell fusion behavior, a key process in tissue formation and regeneration, is another focus of these quantitative models. The fusion of cells often involves the breakdown of the plasma membrane and the subsequent merging of cytoplasmic contents, which is influenced by both mechanical and biochemical factors. Recent advances have enabled the development of models that simulate the dynamics of cell-cell interactions, including the role of adhesion molecules and the mechanical forces involved in the fusion process. These models are often validated through experimental data obtained from single-cell tracking and tissue compression assays, allowing for the estimation of key parameters such as fusion rates and mechanical relaxation timescales [2].\n\nThe integration of these models with experimental data has led to significant insights into the collective behavior of cells in biological tissues. By leveraging maximum likelihood approaches, researchers can infer model parameters directly from single-cell tracking data, even in the presence of substantial noise. This capability enhances the predictive power of the models, enabling the study of macroscopic viscoelastic responses and the dynamics of cell fusion under varying conditions.

This technique leverages the adversarial framework, commonly used in generative adversarial networks (GANs), to enforce consistency between the target distributions and the learned interpolants [5]. By formulating the problem as a minimax game, adversarial learning enables the generation of intermediate distributions that accurately reflect the structure of the input data across multiple marginals. This approach is particularly advantageous in scenarios where the distributions are complex, high-dimensional, or defined over different domains, as it avoids the need for explicit parametric modeling of the joint distribution.\n\nThe application of adversarial learning to multi-marginal distribution matching involves designing a generator that produces interpolants and a discriminator that distinguishes between the true marginals and the generated ones [5]. This setup allows for the direct matching of intermediate marginals, ensuring that the resulting distributions maintain the correct end-point marginals while smoothly interpolating between them. The method is flexible and can be adapted to both discrete and continuous settings, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including time-series data, image generation, and biological data analysis. Furthermore, the adversarial framework naturally incorporates the concept of optimal transport, enabling the learning of transport plans that minimize the cost of moving mass between distributions.\n\nRecent advancements in adversarial learning for multi-marginal distribution matching have demonstrated its effectiveness in capturing complex dependencies and preserving structural properties of the underlying data. By integrating adversarial objectives with optimal transport principles, these methods provide a robust and computationally efficient way to align multiple distributions. This has significant implications for tasks such as lineage tracing, where the accurate modeling of distributional changes over time is critical.

This approach leverages generative models, such as GANs and VAEs, to map data distributions into a structured latent space where distances and relationships reflect the intrinsic geometry of the original data. By explicitly modeling the distribution of data points, generative distribution embedding enables more robust and interpretable representations, particularly for high-dimensional and heterogeneous data. This is especially valuable in biological applications, where data often exhibit complex dependencies and non-linear relationships that are difficult to capture with traditional dimensionality reduction techniques.\n\nThe core idea behind generative distribution embedding involves training a model to generate samples that closely match the target distribution, while simultaneously learning a latent representation that preserves key structural properties. This is achieved through adversarial training, where a generator network learns to produce data that is indistinguishable from real samples, and a discriminator network provides feedback to refine the latent space. The resulting embedding not only captures the global structure of the data but also retains local variations, making it suitable for tasks such as clustering, classification, and lineage tracing. Moreover, the flexibility of generative models allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, enabling the embedding to align with biological or physical principles.\n\nRecent advancements have extended generative distribution embedding to handle multi-modal and temporally evolving data, such as cell lineage trees and dynamic gene expression profiles. These methods often incorporate conditional dependencies and time-aware architectures to model the evolution of distributions over time. By leveraging the generative capabilities of these models, researchers can simulate and analyze complex biological processes with greater accuracy.

By integrating attention modules, such as those found in Vision Transformers or U-Net variants with attention gates, these approaches can better handle complex cell morphologies and overlapping structures, which are common challenges in single-cell imaging. The ability to focus on relevant features while suppressing noise and irrelevant details makes attention-driven models particularly suitable for high-resolution and high-throughput cellular data.\n\nIn the context of lineage reconstruction, transformer-based architectures have been adapted to model temporal dynamics and cell relationships across multiple time points. These models can learn to associate cells across frames by encoding their gene expression profiles, morphological features, and spatial positions, thereby improving the accuracy of lineage tree inference [1]. Attention mechanisms allow the model to prioritize key events, such as cell divisions or differentiation transitions, which are critical for reconstructing accurate developmental trajectories. Furthermore, the modular nature of transformers facilitates the integration of multi-modal data, such as gene expression, imaging, and spatial information, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of cellular dynamics.\n\nRecent advancements have also explored the use of pre-trained transformer models for cell segmentation tasks, where they are fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets to enhance performance.

Twin-VAE is designed to enrich training data by generating synthetic geometric data, where ground truth labels can be easily created without requiring realistic morphological details [6]. This approach significantly reduces the cost of auxiliary training data while maintaining the effectiveness of the model. By leveraging the twin architecture, the model can learn more robust and generalizable features, which are critical for capturing the complex morphological variations observed in cellular structures. The use of adversarial training in Twin-VAE further enhances the model's ability to distinguish between real and synthetic data, leading to improved feature representation.\n\nResidual U-Net, on the other hand, is employed to refine and enhance the morphological features extracted from the data. Its architecture, based on the residual learning framework, allows for deeper networks while mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. This makes it particularly suitable for tasks requiring precise feature extraction and reconstruction, such as cell segmentation and lineage tracking. By combining the strengths of Twin-VAE and residual U-Net, the proposed framework achieves a more comprehensive understanding of cellular morphology, which is essential for accurate lineage inference. The residual connections in the U-Net structure help preserve spatial information, ensuring that fine-grained morphological details are retained throughout the feature learning process.\n\nThe synergy between Twin-VAE and residual U-Net results in a powerful feature learning mechanism that is both data-efficient and robust to variations in cell morphology. This combination enables the model to effectively learn from limited or noisy data, which is common in biological datasets. The enhanced morphological feature learning directly contributes to improved lineage tree reconstruction, as it allows for more accurate identification and tracking of cells over time. By integrating these two architectures, the framework demonstrates significant improvements in capturing the complex relationships between cellular morphology and lineage dynamics, making it a valuable tool in computational lineage tracing [1].",

      "content": "Uncertainty-aware tracking for lineage ambiguity resolution addresses the critical challenge of resolving conflicting or ambiguous lineage relationships in single-cell data. This approach leverages probabilistic models to account for uncertainties arising from incomplete data, segmentation errors, and noisy measurements. By maintaining a distribution over possible lineage configurations, rather than a single deterministic path, uncertainty-aware tracking provides a more robust and interpretable representation of cell lineage dynamics [1]. This is particularly important in scenarios where lineage reconstruction is hindered by limited or imperfect data, such as in cases with overlapping cell divisions or sparse labeling. The method enables the quantification of confidence in lineage assignments, which is essential for downstream analysis and biological interpretation.\n\nThe integration of uncertainty-aware tracking with existing lineage tracing frameworks enhances the reliability of inferred cell trajectories [1]. Techniques such as Bayesian inference and probabilistic graphical models are employed to propagate uncertainty through the tracking process, allowing for the identification of regions with high ambiguity. This is especially valuable in complex cell movies where segmentation errors or low-resolution imaging can lead to incorrect lineage assignments [7]. By explicitly modeling uncertainty, the approach not only improves the accuracy of lineage reconstruction but also provides insights into the reliability of individual lineage paths. This is crucial for applications where the precision of lineage information directly impacts the validity of biological conclusions.\n\nFurthermore, uncertainty-aware tracking facilitates the incorporation of additional data sources, such as clonal information or spatial transcriptomics, into the lineage inference process [8]. This enables a more comprehensive and data-driven approach to lineage resolution, where uncertainty is treated as an inherent aspect of the reconstruction rather than a limitation. The method's ability to handle ambiguity while maintaining computational feasibility makes it a promising tool for large-scale single-cell studies. As the field of lineage tracing continues to evolve, the adoption of uncertainty-aware strategies will be essential for achieving more accurate and biologically meaningful reconstructions of cell development.",

      "content": "Bayesian frameworks have emerged as a powerful approach for lineage tree ranking and clonal data integration, offering a principled way to incorporate uncertainty and prior knowledge into the reconstruction process. These methods leverage probabilistic models to infer the most likely lineage trees by combining observed data with prior distributions over tree structures and branch lengths. By integrating clonal information, such as that from Weinreb et al. (2020), Bayesian approaches can better resolve ambiguities in lineage reconstruction, particularly when multiple cells from the same clone are indistinguishable. This integration allows for more accurate inference of cell trajectories and helps bridge the gap between computational pseudo-lineages and actual biological processes [1].\n\nIn the context of lineage tree ranking, Bayesian methods provide a natural mechanism for evaluating and comparing different possible tree structures. By computing posterior probabilities, these frameworks can rank trees based on their likelihood given the data and prior assumptions, thereby identifying the most plausible lineage configurations. This is especially valuable in weakly supervised settings where only partial or high-level clonal information is available. The ability to propagate uncertainty through the model also enhances robustness, making these frameworks particularly suitable for noisy or incomplete datasets. Moreover, the use of Bayesian inference facilitates the incorporation of additional data sources, such as spatial transcriptomics or single-cell RNA-seq, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of cellular dynamics.\n\nThe application of Bayesian frameworks to clonal data integration presents several challenges, including the need for efficient sampling strategies and the management of complex posterior distributions. Techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference are commonly employed to approximate these distributions, though they come with trade-offs in terms of computational cost and accuracy. Recent advances in scalable Bayesian methods, including those leveraging optimal transport and metric learning, have shown promise in addressing these challenges. By combining these approaches with clonal data, researchers can achieve more accurate and interpretable lineage reconstructions, ultimately advancing our understanding of cellular development and heterogeneity [9].",

This method leverages motion patterns and spatial relationships between cells across consecutive frames to establish correspondences, enabling robust tracking even when cells overlap or move rapidly [10]. Unlike traditional tracking approaches that rely on static features or heuristic rules, motion estimation techniques model the dynamic behavior of cells, allowing for more accurate and adaptive tracking in complex scenarios. These methods often employ optical flow or similar motion estimation strategies to predict cell movements and match them across frames, making them particularly suitable for analyzing dense cell cultures where conventional tracking algorithms struggle [10].\n\nIn crowded environments, motion estimation-based tracking faces unique challenges such as occlusion, high cell density, and rapid morphological changes. To address these issues, recent approaches have integrated dynamic neighborhood formation and optimal matching strategies, inspired by video compression techniques. By dividing the tracking problem into smaller subproblems and using divide-and-conquer strategies, these methods can efficiently handle large numbers of cells while maintaining tracking accuracy [11]. Additionally, motion estimation techniques often incorporate spatial cues such as proximity, movement direction, and intensity variations to improve the reliability of cell correspondence [10]. This combination of dynamic modeling and spatial reasoning enhances the ability to track individual cells even in highly congested regions, where traditional methods may fail.\n\nThe application of motion estimation-based tracking in cell cultures has shown promising results, particularly in scenarios involving cell division and movement [12]. These methods are capable of maintaining consistent tracking over time, even when cells undergo significant changes in shape or size. Furthermore, by integrating temporal regularization and contrastive learning, such approaches can learn more discriminative and stable embeddings that capture the dynamic behavior of cells [13]. This not only improves tracking performance but also enables deeper insights into cellular behavior, such as lineage tracing and spatial interaction analysis. As a result, motion estimation-based tracking is becoming an essential tool for high-throughput cell analysis in various biological and medical applications [11].",

Microbial cells present unique challenges due to their rapid division rates, morphological variability, and high-density clustering, which complicate the design and evaluation of tracking algorithms [11]. Unlike conventional MOT, where object appearance and motion are relatively stable, microbial tracking requires robust handling of dynamic changes, including cell death, which is often overlooked in existing benchmarks [8]. This necessitates the development of specialized metrics and datasets that capture the full spectrum of cellular behaviors, including both division and death events.\n\nCurrent benchmarks, such as the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC), primarily focus on single-channel images with limited diversity in cellular dynamics, thereby failing to address the complexity of microbial systems [12]. These datasets often lack the multi-channel, high-resolution, and long-term time-lapse data essential for capturing the full range of microbial behaviors. As a result, existing tracking algorithms, while effective in controlled environments, struggle to generalize to real-world microbial imaging scenarios [11]. This gap highlights the need for new benchmarking frameworks that incorporate multi-channel data, dynamic cellular states, and long-term tracking capabilities to better reflect the challenges of microbial imaging [8].\n\nTo address these limitations, recent efforts have focused on developing automated tracking strategies that leverage learned feature embeddings and spatial cues, combined with Kalman Filter-based interpolation to ensure continuity. These methods aim to reduce reliance on hand-crafted heuristics and improve robustness in high-density and low-frame-rate conditions. However, the lack of standardized benchmarks and comprehensive datasets continues to hinder progress.

By leveraging contrastive learning, methods like DynaCLR encode both spatial and temporal information, allowing for the extraction of meaningful features that reflect the underlying biological dynamics. This approach enables the modeling of complex, multi-dimensional time-lapse data while maintaining robustness to variations in imaging conditions and cell types.\n\nThe integration of temporally regularized embeddings into cell and organelle tracking frameworks enhances the interpretability and utility of learned representations for downstream tasks [13].
