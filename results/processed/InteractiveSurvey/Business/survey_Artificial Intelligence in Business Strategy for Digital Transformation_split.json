Despite growing awareness of AI risks, the absence of universally accepted standards for incident reporting creates significant barriers to accountability and improvement [3]. Current practices vary widely across organizations, with many relying on ad hoc or proprietary methods that lack transparency and interoperability. This fragmentation hinders the ability to aggregate data, identify patterns, and develop effective mitigation strategies, thereby limiting the overall reliability and trustworthiness of AI systems.\n\nStandardization efforts face multiple hurdles, including the dynamic and evolving nature of AI technologies, the complexity of AI decision-making processes, and the lack of consensus on what constitutes an AI incident. Additionally, the absence of clear regulatory frameworks and the reluctance of some organizations to disclose incidents due to reputational or legal concerns further complicate the development of standardized reporting mechanisms. These challenges are exacerbated by the interdisciplinary nature of AI, which involves not only technical aspects but also ethical, legal, and societal dimensions that must be considered in any comprehensive reporting framework.\n\nTo address these issues, the section outlines key areas for improvement, such as the development of common definitions, the establishment of reporting protocols, and the integration of incident data into broader AI governance strategies [3]. It emphasizes the importance of collaboration among stakeholders, including developers, regulators, and end-users, to create a more cohesive and effective approach to AI incident management.

These methods involve immersive, long-term observation of software engineering teams, often within their natural work environments, to capture the nuances of collaboration, decision-making, and knowledge sharing. By focusing on the lived experiences of software engineers, ethnography provides insights that are often overlooked by more quantitative or structural approaches [10]. This method is particularly valuable for studying how software engineering practices evolve in response to organizational, technological, and societal changes, and how these practices are embedded within broader professional and cultural frameworks.\n\nA key strength of ethnographic research in software engineering is its ability to uncover the tacit knowledge and informal practices that underpin successful development processes. Unlike surveys or interviews, which may rely on participants' self-reported understanding, ethnography allows researchers to observe and document the actual behaviors, rituals, and communication patterns that characterize software teams. This can reveal discrepancies between official procedures and on-the-ground realities, highlighting areas where process improvements or training may be needed. Furthermore, ethnographic studies often emphasize the role of human agency, power dynamics, and organizational culture in shaping software engineering outcomes, offering a more holistic view of the field [10].\n\nDespite its advantages, the application of ethnographic methods in software engineering faces several challenges, including the time-intensive nature of data collection and the difficulty of generalizing findings across different contexts. However, recent advancements in digital ethnography and mixed-methods research have expanded the applicability of these approaches, enabling researchers to combine observational data with other forms of analysis.

      "content": "Critical discourse analysis of AI ethics and power dynamics reveals how dominant narratives around artificial intelligence are shaped by institutional and corporate interests, often reinforcing existing power structures. Tech companies, particularly those with significant resources and influence, play a central role in defining ethical standards and governance frameworks. This influence is evident in the recruitment of AI ethics researchers from within these organizations, creating a feedback loop that aligns academic discourse with corporate priorities [11]. As a result, ethical considerations are frequently framed through the lens of innovation and commercial viability rather than broader societal well-being, raising concerns about the neutrality and inclusivity of AI ethics discourse [11].\n\nThe intersection of AI ethics and power dynamics also manifests in the uneven distribution of benefits and risks associated with AI technologies [11]. While large tech firms often set the agenda for ethical AI, marginalized communities and regions may lack the capacity to influence or even participate in these discussions. This imbalance is exacerbated by the global nature of AI development, where regulatory frameworks and ethical norms established in technologically advanced economies may not be applicable or equitable in other contexts. Consequently, critical discourse analysis highlights the need for more inclusive and participatory approaches to AI ethics that challenge the dominance of corporate and Western-centric perspectives.\n\nMoreover, the discourse surrounding AI ethics is often mediated by the language and framing used by stakeholders, which can obscure underlying power imbalances. Terms such as \"transparency\" and \"fairness\" are frequently deployed in ways that prioritize technical solutions over systemic change, reinforcing the status quo. This linguistic framing not only shapes public perception but also influences policy and regulatory outcomes.
