      "content": "Parameter-efficient distillation and layer-wise adaptation techniques have emerged as critical strategies for developing compact and efficient models, particularly in the context of pre-trained language models (PLMs). These methods aim to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining or even improving performance on downstream tasks. Distillation techniques, such as knowledge distillation, transfer the knowledge from a large, well-performing teacher model to a smaller student model, enabling the latter to achieve comparable results with fewer parameters. This approach is often complemented by layer-wise adaptation, which involves fine-tuning specific layers of the student model to better align with the teacher's representations. These techniques are especially valuable in resource-constrained environments where deploying large models is impractical.\n\nRecent research has focused on optimizing the efficiency of distillation by introducing mechanisms such as bottleneck adapters, which allow for parameter-efficient fine-tuning by inserting small, trainable modules into the model architecture. These adapters enable layer-wise adaptation without requiring full retraining of the model, making them suitable for scenarios with limited computational resources. Additionally, techniques like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and parameter sharing have been explored to further reduce the number of trainable parameters. By combining these approaches, researchers have demonstrated that compact models can achieve performance close to their larger counterparts while significantly reducing inference latency and memory footprint. This has led to the development of models such as MiniALBERT, which leverages both distillation and layer-wise adaptation to create highly efficient variants of PLMs.\n\nThe effectiveness of these techniques is often evaluated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, where the performance of compact models is compared against their full-sized counterparts. Metrics such as accuracy, inference speed, and parameter count are used to assess the trade-offs between model size and performance. Furthermore, the adaptability of these methods to different domains and tasks is a key area of investigation, as the effectiveness of distillation and layer-wise adaptation can vary depending on the specific application. Overall, the exploration of parameter-efficient distillation and layer-wise adaptation techniques represents a vital direction in the development of compact models that are both effective and scalable for real-world deployment.",

      "content": "The section explores the investigation of probing tasks and knowledge extraction methods aimed at assessing the intrinsic capabilities of language model embeddings. Probing tasks are designed to uncover the types of linguistic and semantic information encoded within these embeddings, often by training simple classifiers on top of fixed embeddings. These tasks include named entity recognition (NER), natural language inference (NLI), and semantic textual similarity (STS), among others [7]. By evaluating model performance on such tasks, researchers can determine the extent to which embeddings capture syntactic, semantic, and contextual information. This approach provides insights into the representational power of pre-trained models and helps identify the strengths and limitations of different embedding strategies.\n\nKnowledge extraction methods further complement probing tasks by examining how effectively embeddings can be leveraged to extract structured information from unstructured text. Techniques such as entity linking, relation extraction, and fact verification are employed to assess the ability of embeddings to capture and utilize domain-specific knowledge. These methods often involve fine-tuning pre-trained models on task-specific data or using external knowledge bases to enhance the extraction process. The results highlight the importance of both the quality of the training data and the architecture of the models in determining the effectiveness of knowledge extraction. Additionally, the interplay between tokenization strategies and the granularity of linguistic units is explored, revealing that optimal performance varies across tasks and languages [8].\n\nThe investigation also underscores the influence of training data and model architecture on the intrinsic capabilities of embeddings. Studies show that models trained on diverse and high-quality corpora tend to exhibit superior performance across probing tasks, while those trained on limited or biased data may struggle with certain linguistic phenomena. Furthermore, the role of morphological and syntactic information in shaping embedding representations is examined, emphasizing the need for task-specific adaptations. Overall, the section provides a comprehensive analysis of how probing tasks and knowledge extraction methods contribute to understanding the depth and breadth of information encoded in language model embeddings, offering valuable guidance for model development and application in downstream NLP tasks.",

      "content": "The development of automated claim–text pair construction and fact-checking frameworks using language models has emerged as a critical area of research, driven by the need for scalable and reliable methods to verify the accuracy of textual assertions. These frameworks leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to generate synthetic claim–text pairs, which are essential for training and evaluating fact-checking systems [9]. By utilizing the contextual understanding and generation capabilities of language models, researchers can automatically construct pairs that reflect real-world scenarios, thereby reducing the reliance on manually annotated datasets. This approach not only accelerates the data curation process but also enhances the diversity and representativeness of the training data, which is crucial for robust model performance.\n\nRecent advancements in language models have enabled the creation of sophisticated fact-checking systems that integrate both claim generation and verification components. These systems often employ a two-stage process: first, generating synthetic claim–text pairs using language models, and second, utilizing these pairs to fine-tune fact-checking models [9]. The synthetic data is typically generated by extracting atomic facts from a corpus, constructing claims based on these facts, and assigning veracity labels through automated means such as support tables [9]. This methodology allows for the creation of large-scale, high-quality datasets that can be used to train models to detect inconsistencies and verify claims with high accuracy. Furthermore, the integration of language models into the fact-checking pipeline enables the system to handle complex linguistic structures and nuanced reasoning, which are essential for accurate verification.\n\nThe effectiveness of these frameworks has been demonstrated through evaluations on benchmark datasets such as PubHealth and SciFact, where models trained on synthetic data have shown competitive performance compared to those trained on manually annotated datasets. This indicates that the use of language models in constructing claim–text pairs can significantly enhance the efficiency and scalability of fact-checking systems. Additionally, the adaptability of these frameworks to different domains and languages makes them a versatile tool for addressing the challenges of misinformation and factual accuracy across various applications. As the field continues to evolve, further research is needed to refine these methods and explore their potential in real-world settings.",

      "content": "Adversarial prompting and synthetic data curation play a pivotal role in enhancing the robustness and generalization capabilities of pre-trained language models (PLMs). Adversarial prompting involves generating input samples designed to exploit model vulnerabilities, thereby exposing weaknesses in the model's decision-making process. This technique is particularly useful in identifying model fragility under perturbed or deceptive inputs, which is crucial for real-world deployment where data may not always conform to ideal conditions. By systematically evaluating models against adversarial prompts, researchers can uncover limitations in model architecture, training data, and tokenization strategies, leading to more resilient and reliable systems. Furthermore, adversarial prompting can be leveraged to improve model robustness through iterative training, where models are exposed to adversarial examples to enhance their ability to generalize across diverse input scenarios.\n\nSynthetic data curation, on the other hand, involves the generation of artificial data to augment or replace real-world datasets, particularly in scenarios where data scarcity or bias is a concern. This approach is especially valuable in domains such as healthcare, where sensitive or limited data hinders model development. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data, researchers can create diverse and representative samples that reflect the structure and characteristics of real data [9]. This not only mitigates the risk of overfitting to biased or limited training sets but also enhances model generalization by exposing the model to a broader range of linguistic and contextual variations. When combined with adversarial prompting, synthetic data curation can further strengthen model resilience by simulating challenging scenarios that test the model's ability to maintain performance under uncertainty.\n\nThe interplay between adversarial prompting and synthetic data curation offers a dual strategy for improving model robustness and generalization. Adversarial prompting helps identify and address model weaknesses, while synthetic data curation provides the necessary diversity and scale to train models that can handle unseen or adversarial inputs. Together, these techniques enable a more comprehensive evaluation of model capabilities, ensuring that models are not only accurate on standard benchmarks but also reliable in real-world settings. This synergy is particularly important in high-stakes applications where model failure can have significant consequences, such as in medical diagnosis or legal reasoning. By integrating these approaches into model development and evaluation pipelines, researchers can build more robust, generalizable, and trustworthy AI systems.",

      "content": "This section examines the effectiveness of biomedical entity linking using a two-stage prompting and self-verification mechanism. The approach leverages the strengths of large language models (LLMs) by first generating candidate entity links through a structured prompting process, followed by a self-verification step that evaluates the plausibility of these links using internal consistency checks and contextual coherence. This dual-phase strategy aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of entity linking in complex biomedical texts, where entities often have ambiguous or polysemous meanings [10]. The two-stage prompting ensures that the model generates a diverse set of potential links, while the self-verification mechanism filters out incorrect or irrelevant suggestions, thereby improving the overall quality of the linking process.\n\nThe self-verification mechanism is designed to assess the generated entity links through a series of automated evaluations, including semantic similarity, syntactic consistency, and alignment with domain-specific knowledge. This involves comparing the generated links against a curated biomedical knowledge base and leveraging pre-trained language models to evaluate the contextual relevance of the links [11]. By integrating these verification steps, the framework reduces the risk of false positives and ensures that the final entity links are both semantically and contextually accurate. The process is further refined by incorporating feedback loops that allow the model to iteratively improve its linking capabilities based on the outcomes of previous verification steps, leading to a more robust and adaptive linking system.\n\nExperimental results demonstrate that the two-stage prompting and self-verification approach significantly outperforms conventional entity linking methods, particularly in scenarios involving rare or complex biomedical entities. The method’s ability to dynamically adjust to the context of the text and leverage domain-specific knowledge makes it well-suited for applications in biomedical information extraction and knowledge graph construction. The findings underscore the potential of combining prompting strategies with self-verification mechanisms to achieve more accurate and reliable entity linking in specialized domains, paving the way for future research into more sophisticated and context-aware linking frameworks.",

This section evaluates the effectiveness of these techniques in improving model generalizability, factual accuracy, and domain-specific reasoning. KG integration provides structured semantic information that supplements the implicit knowledge captured by PLMs, enabling more precise and context-aware predictions. Adapter-based knowledge injection, on the other hand, allows for efficient fine-tuning by introducing lightweight modules that inject domain-specific knowledge without retraining the entire model. These methods are particularly beneficial in low-resource or specialized domains where explicit knowledge representation is essential for model performance.\n\nEmpirical studies demonstrate that KG integration significantly improves model performance on tasks requiring factual reasoning and entity disambiguation. By leveraging structured relational data, models can better capture semantic relationships and reduce errors stemming from ambiguous or incomplete textual information. Adapter-based injection further enhances adaptability by enabling targeted knowledge updates, making it a scalable solution for dynamic or evolving domains. The combination of both approaches has shown to yield superior results compared to standalone methods, particularly in tasks involving complex domain knowledge. However, the effectiveness of these techniques varies depending on the quality and coverage of the underlying KGs, as well as the design of the adapter modules.\n\nThe evaluation also highlights the trade-offs between model complexity, computational efficiency, and performance gains. While KG integration and adapter-based injection offer substantial benefits, they introduce additional overhead in terms of model size and training requirements. Future work should focus on optimizing these methods for real-world deployment, ensuring that the benefits of knowledge integration are accessible without compromising efficiency. Overall, the integration of structured knowledge and modular adaptation mechanisms represents a promising direction for advancing the capabilities of PLMs in specialized and knowledge-intensive applications.",

      "content": "The comparative analysis of large language models (LLMs) on structured and unstructured biomedical data reveals significant variations in performance across different task-specific metrics [12]. Structured biomedical data, such as electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical coding systems, often require precise entity recognition, relation extraction, and logical reasoning. In contrast, unstructured data, including clinical notes and research articles, demand robust semantic understanding and contextual interpretation. Task-specific metrics such as F1-score, precision, recall, and area under the curve (AUC) are employed to evaluate model performance, with results indicating that models fine-tuned on domain-specific corpora generally outperform general-purpose LLMs. However, the complexity of biomedical terminology and the need for domain-specific knowledge integration remain critical challenges.\n\nThe analysis highlights that while LLMs demonstrate strong performance on tasks like named entity recognition (NER) and multi-label classification (CLS), their effectiveness on more nuanced tasks such as semantic textual similarity (STS) and clinical reasoning is less consistent. This discrepancy is attributed to the limitations of standard tokenization strategies, which often fail to account for the agglutinative nature of biomedical terms derived from Greek and Latin [8]. Models that incorporate morpheme-enriched tokenization strategies show improved performance, particularly in handling rare or complex biomedical terminology [8]. Additionally, the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and domain-specific fine-tuning further enhances model accuracy, especially when dealing with low-resource or highly specialized biomedical data.\n\nOverall, the comparative study underscores the importance of task-specific adaptation and domain-aware design in biomedical NLP [1]. While LLMs exhibit considerable potential, their performance is heavily influenced by the quality and structure of training data, as well as the alignment of model architecture with task requirements. The results emphasize the need for continued research into domain-specific model optimization, including enhanced tokenization, structured data integration, and task-driven fine-tuning strategies to improve the reliability and applicability of LLMs in biomedical contexts.",

Expert annotations provide a gold standard for validating model outputs, ensuring that predictions align with human judgment and domain-specific knowledge. This process involves careful curation of datasets by domain experts, who annotate text with labels that reflect the correct factual content, contextual nuances, and semantic relationships. By comparing model outputs against these annotations, researchers can identify discrepancies, evaluate the consistency of predictions, and refine models to improve accuracy. Such evaluations are especially important in applications like legal, medical, and scientific domains, where errors can have significant real-world consequences.\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful technique to enhance model reliability by integrating external knowledge sources during the generation process. Unlike traditional language models that rely solely on internal knowledge, RAG systems retrieve relevant information from a pre-constructed knowledge base or corpus, allowing models to generate responses grounded in factual data. This approach mitigates the risk of hallucinations and improves the accuracy of generated content by ensuring that outputs are supported by verifiable information. The effectiveness of RAG is often assessed through both automated metrics and human evaluations, with expert annotations playing a key role in determining the factual correctness and coherence of generated text. By combining retrieval mechanisms with language generation, RAG systems offer a promising pathway to building more reliable and trustworthy AI models.\n\nThe integration of expert annotations and RAG techniques presents a multi-faceted approach to model evaluation, addressing both the reliability of predictions and the accuracy of generated content. While expert annotations provide a high-quality benchmark for assessing model performance, RAG enhances the model's ability to produce factually accurate outputs by leveraging external data. Together, these methods enable a comprehensive evaluation framework that accounts for both the model's internal knowledge and its capacity to retrieve and synthesize external information. This dual approach not only improves the robustness of model assessments but also supports the development of systems that can operate effectively in complex, knowledge-intensive environments.

These frameworks leverage the strengths of pre-trained language models in understanding natural language and the structured representation of knowledge graphs to enhance reasoning capabilities. By combining the contextual understanding of language models with the factual and relational information in knowledge graphs, such systems can better resolve ambiguities, perform multi-hop reasoning, and generate more accurate answers. The integration often involves aligning mentions in text with entities in the knowledge graph, capturing interactions between entities, and utilizing the graph structure to guide reasoning processes. This synergy enables models to go beyond simple pattern matching and engage in more sophisticated, knowledge-driven reasoning.\n\nA key challenge in these frameworks is effectively modeling the interactions between mentions in text and entities in the knowledge graph, as well as the relationships between entities themselves. Recent approaches have focused on improving the alignment of text and knowledge by incorporating entity embeddings, relational information, and attention mechanisms that highlight relevant parts of the graph. Additionally, some methods directly generate answer symbols rather than entity names, which helps avoid generating entities that do not exist in the ontology and reduces the need for extensive normalization [13]. This approach not only improves accuracy but also enhances the robustness of the system in handling out-of-vocabulary or ambiguous mentions. By explicitly modeling these interactions, joint reasoning frameworks can better capture the nuances of complex questions and provide more reliable answers.\n\nThe effectiveness of these frameworks has been demonstrated through various experiments, particularly in biomedical and domain-specific question answering tasks [14]. By leveraging pre-trained language models and integrating them with knowledge graphs, these systems have shown significant improvements in performance compared to traditional methods [15]. The use of graph neural networks and hierarchical knowledge structures further enhances the ability to reason over complex relational data. As research continues, the focus remains on improving the scalability, interpretability, and generalization of these frameworks, making them more applicable to a wide range of domains and tasks.

Integrating these representations allows models to better understand the context and relationships within biomedical documents, leading to more accurate and relevant retrieval results. This approach is particularly beneficial in scenarios where biomedical entities exhibit complex relationships, such as gene-disease associations or drug-target interactions, which are challenging to capture with text-only models.\n\nRecent studies have explored various strategies for fusing text and graph representations, including early fusion, late fusion, and hybrid methods that enable bidirectional information exchange. Early fusion methods integrate graph information into text encoders during training, while late fusion techniques combine the outputs of separate text and graph models. Hybrid approaches, such as graph-augmented language models, dynamically incorporate graph-based context during inference, allowing models to leverage relational knowledge while maintaining the flexibility of text-based representations. These methods have demonstrated significant improvements in tasks such as biomedical entity linking, relation extraction, and question answering, where the ability to capture both semantic and structural information is crucial.\n\nThe effectiveness of text and graph fusion is further enhanced by the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformer-based architectures, which enable the modeling of complex interactions between entities and their contextual information.

These approaches aim to improve the representation of entities by explicitly incorporating their semantic and relational information during pre-training. Entity-aware masking focuses on masking entity tokens rather than random tokens, encouraging the model to learn entity-centric representations that capture the context and relationships between entities. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios where entities share high lexical similarity, such as \"haemoglobin\" and \"hemoglobin,\" where traditional masking strategies may fail to distinguish between them. By prioritizing entity-level information, entity-aware masking enhances the model's ability to resolve ambiguities and improve entity linking accuracy.\n\nCoarse-to-fine masking extends this concept by introducing a hierarchical approach to masking, where initial coarse-grained masking of entities is followed by fine-grained masking of sub-entities or related terms. This allows the model to progressively refine its understanding of entity interactions at multiple levels of granularity. For instance, in biomedical texts, coarse masking may target high-level entities like \"disease\" or \"protein,\" while fine masking focuses on specific terms such as \"haemoglobin c\" or \"hemoglobin.\" This layered masking strategy enables the model to capture both global and local semantic relationships, enhancing its capacity to reason about complex biomedical concepts. Additionally, coarse-to-fine masking helps in reducing the reliance on normalization strategies by directly generating entity symbols, thereby improving the robustness of knowledge injection.\n\nThese masking strategies are particularly effective in scenarios where the model needs to integrate external knowledge, such as from biomedical knowledge graphs. By explicitly injecting entity and relational information during pre-training, the model gains a more structured understanding of the domain, which is crucial for tasks like biomedical entity linking and question answering. The combination of entity-aware and coarse-to-fine masking not only improves the model's ability to capture semantic relationships but also enhances its generalization across diverse biomedical tasks.

While rule-based systems offer transparency and interpretability, they often struggle with the high variability and ambiguity inherent in biomedical texts. For instance, the same term may refer to multiple entities, and synonyms or morphological variations can lead to incorrect mappings. Furthermore, the maintenance of such systems is labor-intensive, requiring continuous updates to accommodate new terminology and evolving ontologies.

Future research should focus on developing robust evaluation metrics that align with clinical standards and user feedback, ensuring that LLMs not only express appropriate emotions but also support users in a clinically meaningful way. This will be essential for the responsible deployment of LLMs in mental health support systems [2].",

      "content": "Adversarial prompting and synthetic data generation play a critical role in enhancing the robustness of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes applications such as clinical decision-making. Adversarial prompting involves crafting inputs designed to exploit model vulnerabilities, revealing weaknesses in reasoning, confidence estimation, and response reliability. By systematically probing these weaknesses, researchers can identify failure modes and refine model behavior to better align with real-world constraints. Synthetic data generation, on the other hand, provides a scalable approach to augment training and evaluation datasets, enabling models to encounter a broader range of scenarios. This is particularly important in domains like healthcare, where real-world data is often limited by privacy and ethical constraints. Together, these techniques help build models that are not only accurate but also resilient to edge cases and uncertain conditions.\n\nRecent studies have explored the interplay between adversarial prompting and synthetic data in improving model reliability. For instance, synthetic dialogues generated using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles have been used to train models to recognize emotional cues and respond appropriately. However, these synthetic interactions often lack the nuanced emotional dynamics present in real clinical settings, highlighting the need for more sophisticated generation methods. Adversarial prompting techniques have been employed to test and refine models’ ability to detect and respond to ambiguous or misleading inputs, thereby improving their capacity to abstain from answering when confidence is low. These approaches contribute to a more balanced accuracy-reliability trade-off, ensuring models operate within safe boundaries.\n\nThe integration of adversarial prompting and synthetic data generation also presents challenges in maintaining model consistency and avoiding spurious learning. Adversarial examples can introduce biases or lead to overfitting if not carefully managed, while synthetic data may not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenarios. To address these issues, frameworks have been developed that combine confidence-aware mechanisms with iterative refinement processes, ensuring that models remain robust across diverse conditions. These strategies are essential for advancing the deployment of LLMs in critical applications, where reliability and safety are paramount [22].",

      "level": 3,
      "content": "The integration of long-context input and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to enhance the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in complex domains such as healthcare. Traditional LLMs often struggle with tasks requiring extended contextual understanding or access to up-to-date, domain-specific knowledge. By incorporating long-context input mechanisms, models can process and reason over extended sequences of text, enabling more accurate interpretation of complex documents like electronic health records (EHRs). RAG further extends this capability by dynamically retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases, allowing models to generate responses grounded in factual data rather than relying solely on internal knowledge. This dual strategy addresses limitations in both context retention and knowledge currency, making LLMs more reliable for real-world applications.\n\nRecent studies have explored how long-context input and RAG can be optimized to improve generalization across diverse tasks. Techniques such as sliding window attention, hierarchical memory encoding, and efficient retrieval indexing have been proposed to manage the computational challenges of processing long inputs. Additionally, the use of dense retrieval models and hybrid architectures that combine retrieval with generative components has shown promise in balancing efficiency and accuracy. These advancements enable models to handle tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, such as clinical decision support, where the ability to synthesize information from multiple sources is essential. By leveraging both extended context and external knowledge, these models demonstrate improved robustness and adaptability in dynamic environments.\n\nDespite these advances, challenges remain in ensuring the scalability and consistency of long-context and RAG-based systems. The computational overhead of processing extended inputs and maintaining retrieval efficiency can limit real-time deployment, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Furthermore, the quality of retrieved information and the alignment between retrieved data and generated outputs remain critical factors affecting performance. Ongoing research focuses on refining these components through better indexing strategies, more effective relevance scoring, and improved alignment between retrieval and generation modules. As these techniques continue to evolve, they hold significant potential to enhance the generalization and reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains such as healthcare [22].",

      "heading": "6 Future Directions",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "Despite significant progress in pre-trained language models (PLMs) for biomedical applications, several limitations and gaps remain. One major limitation is the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks that account for both accuracy and reliability in real-world clinical settings. Current benchmarks often prioritize performance metrics without adequately addressing the risks of model hallucinations, overconfidence, or misinterpretation of complex biomedical data. Additionally, the integration of domain-specific knowledge into PLMs remains challenging, particularly in low-resource or rapidly evolving domains where up-to-date and structured information is scarce. Furthermore, the adaptability of PLMs to diverse biomedical tasks, such as entity linking, relation extraction, and question answering, is still limited by the need for extensive fine-tuning and domain-specific adaptation. These challenges underscore the need for more robust and generalizable approaches that can effectively balance performance, reliability, and adaptability in biomedical NLP.\n\nTo address these limitations, future research should focus on developing more reliable and interpretable PLMs that can dynamically adapt to biomedical contexts while maintaining high accuracy. One promising direction is the exploration of hybrid architectures that combine pre-trained language models with knowledge graphs, structured data, and domain-specific knowledge bases. These frameworks can enhance model reasoning capabilities by incorporating explicit relational information and improving the accuracy of entity and relation extraction. Additionally, further investigation into parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, such as adapter-based knowledge injection and low-rank fine-tuning, can enable scalable and efficient model updates without compromising performance. Another important research direction is the development of confidence-aware and uncertainty-aware models that can better handle ambiguous or incomplete biomedical data, thereby improving the safety and reliability of AI systems in clinical applications.\n\nThe proposed future work has the potential to significantly advance the field of biomedical NLP by addressing critical challenges in model reliability, knowledge integration, and domain adaptation. By improving the robustness and generalization of PLMs, these advancements can enhance the accuracy of information extraction, clinical decision-making, and knowledge discovery in biomedical domains. Furthermore, the development of more interpretable and trustworthy models can increase user confidence and facilitate the adoption of AI in healthcare settings. Ultimately, these efforts will contribute to the creation of more effective, scalable, and clinically relevant language models that can support a wide range of biomedical applications, from patient care to scientific research.",
