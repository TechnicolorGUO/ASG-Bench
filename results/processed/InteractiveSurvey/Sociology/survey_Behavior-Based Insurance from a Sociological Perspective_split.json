      "content": "The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into social and economic systems has sparked a growing interest in understanding the behavioral dimensions of these technologies. As AI systems become more autonomous and capable of engaging in complex interactions, their behaviors increasingly mirror human social dynamics, raising important questions about accountability, transparency, and ethical implications. This intersection of technology and society has become a focal point for researchers across multiple disciplines, including computer science, sociology, and economics. The study of AI behavior is no longer confined to technical performance metrics but now encompasses broader sociological and ethical considerations. This shift reflects a recognition that AI systems are not merely tools but active participants in social structures, influencing and being influenced by the environments in which they operate.\n\nThis survey paper explores behavior-based insurance from a sociological perspective, examining how AI systems interact with human actors and the broader societal implications of these interactions. The focus on behavior-based insurance is driven by the growing need to understand how AI-driven decision-making processes in the insurance sector can be aligned with human values and social norms [1]. Unlike traditional insurance models that rely on static risk assessments, behavior-based insurance incorporates real-time behavioral data to adjust premiums and risk profiles. This approach not only introduces new technical challenges but also raises critical sociological questions about fairness, privacy, and the potential for unintended consequences. By analyzing the sociological dimensions of AI behavior, this paper aims to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how AI systems shape and are shaped by social contexts.\n\nThe paper begins with a sociological analysis of AI behavior, focusing on decentralized agent interactions and reciprocity. It explores how autonomous agents in multi-agent systems develop social structures and norms through self-directed exchanges. The discussion extends to theoretical models of decision-making, examining how factors like grit and financial support influence strategic outcomes [2]. Empirical and qualitative approaches to AI trustworthiness are also analyzed, with an emphasis on case studies and expert insights into AI risk management. The integration of sociological and computational perspectives is further explored through the lens of human-chatbot interaction, highlighting the evolving dynamics of social exchanges between humans and AI. The paper also addresses the stigmatization patterns in large language model (LLM)-generated narratives, emphasizing the role of AI in reinforcing or challenging societal biases. Finally, the section on social graph and user behavior modeling investigates the long-term dynamics of human-machine interactions, shedding light on how user behavior and social relationships shape the effectiveness of AI systems.\n\nThis survey paper makes several key contributions to the field of AI and sociology. It provides a comprehensive overview of the sociological dimensions of AI behavior, offering a framework for understanding how AI systems interact with human actors and social structures. By integrating theoretical, empirical, and computational perspectives, the paper advances the discussion on behavior-based insurance and its broader implications [1]. Additionally, it highlights the importance of addressing ethical and sociological concerns in AI development, advocating for the creation of systems that are not only technically robust but also socially aligned. Through its interdisciplinary approach, the paper contributes to the ongoing dialogue on responsible AI development and its impact on society.",

      "level": 3,
      "content": "Decentralized agent interactions represent a paradigm shift in the dynamics of multi-agent AI systems, where autonomous entities engage in complex, self-directed exchanges without human oversight. These interactions are characterized by the emergence of social structures and norms, as agents develop mechanisms to coordinate, negotiate, and form relationships. The concept of reciprocity becomes central in these environments, as agents must balance self-interest with cooperative behaviors to sustain long-term interactions. This form of interaction is not merely transactional but involves the development of trust, reputation, and mutual benefit, mirroring human social dynamics. The decentralized nature of these systems allows for emergent behaviors that are not explicitly programmed, leading to unpredictable yet adaptive outcomes.\n\nThe role of reciprocity in decentralized agent systems is critical for ensuring stability and efficiency in interactions. Unlike traditional economic models that emphasize individual rationality, these systems often rely on iterative and conditional cooperation, where agents adjust their behavior based on past interactions. This creates a feedback loop that reinforces cooperative norms and deters exploitative strategies. However, the absence of centralized control introduces challenges in enforcing fairness and preventing free-riding. As a result, mechanisms such as reputation systems, incentive structures, and adaptive learning algorithms are essential for maintaining equilibrium. These mechanisms enable agents to dynamically respond to changing conditions, fostering a resilient and self-regulating network of interactions.\n\nThe implications of decentralized agent interactions and reciprocity extend beyond technical systems, influencing broader societal and ethical considerations. As AI agents become more autonomous, their ability to engage in socially meaningful interactions raises questions about accountability, transparency, and the potential for unintended consequences. The development of robust frameworks for managing these interactions is crucial to ensure that decentralized systems align with human values and societal norms. Future research must address the challenges of scalability, security, and ethical alignment, while also exploring how these systems can contribute to more equitable and sustainable social structures.",

      "level": 3,
      "content": "The interplay between grit and financial support significantly influences strategic outcomes, particularly in contexts where long-term goals require sustained effort and resource allocation [2]. Grit, defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals, can enhance an agent's capacity to persist through challenges, yet its effectiveness may be contingent on the availability of financial resources. Financial support, when available, can alleviate immediate constraints, allowing individuals or organizations to invest in strategies that align with their long-term objectives. This dynamic suggests that the combination of grit and financial assistance can amplify the likelihood of achieving ambitious outcomes, though the precise mechanisms through which they interact remain complex and context-dependent [2].\n\nEmpirical studies have shown that financial supplements can mitigate the negative effects of resource scarcity, enabling agents to maintain or even increase their level of effort over time. However, the presence of financial support does not automatically guarantee success; it must be aligned with the agent's strategic orientation and capacity for sustained engagement. Grit, in this context, serves as a critical mediator, influencing how financial resources are utilized and whether they are directed toward high-impact, long-term initiatives. This relationship underscores the importance of designing systems that not only provide financial support but also foster the development of grit through structured feedback, goal alignment, and motivational reinforcement.\n\nTheoretical models, such as the two-armed bandit framework, offer a structured approach to analyzing how grit and financial support interact within decision-making processes [2]. These models highlight the trade-offs between stable, low-risk rewards and ambitious, high-reward outcomes, illustrating how financial resources can enable agents to pursue more ambitious strategies. By isolating the effects of grit and financial support, such models provide a foundation for understanding the strategic dynamics that shape outcomes in various domains, from health financing to technological innovation. This analytical lens is essential for developing policies and interventions that effectively harness both human resilience and material resources.",

      "content": "Case studies and expert insights on AI risk management reveal a growing recognition of the complexities involved in governing autonomous AI systems. Researchers and practitioners have begun to explore how multi-agent AI systems, which operate without human mediation, can generate unforeseen risks, such as unintended coordination, emergent behaviors, and systemic vulnerabilities. These insights are often drawn from interdisciplinary analyses that integrate perspectives from computer science, ethics, law, and social sciences. Experts emphasize the need for proactive governance frameworks that anticipate risks before they materialize, while also acknowledging the limitations of current regulatory tools in addressing the dynamic and opaque nature of AI interactions [3]. Such case studies underscore the importance of collaboration between AI developers, policymakers, and domain experts to create resilient and transparent systems.\n\nExpert analyses further highlight the role of criminologists in understanding the potential for AI systems to be exploited or misused in ways that could exacerbate societal harms [4]. By examining patterns of behavior and risk factors, criminologists can contribute to the development of predictive models that identify early warning signs of AI-related risks [4]. These insights are particularly relevant in contexts where AI agents interact with human users, such as in healthcare, finance, and public services. The integration of criminological perspectives into AI risk management not only enhances the ability to detect and mitigate risks but also ensures that governance strategies are informed by a deeper understanding of human behavior and its intersection with technology [4].\n\nFinally, the evolving landscape of AI risk management is shaped by ongoing empirical research and practical implementations. Studies on AI-driven recommendation systems, for instance, demonstrate how agent-based simulations can be used to evaluate the long-term impacts of algorithmic decisions. These simulations, which incorporate psychological and social dimensions, offer a more holistic view of how AI systems interact with users and influence outcomes. As the field advances, the convergence of technical, ethical, and social considerations will be critical in shaping effective risk management strategies that balance innovation with accountability.",

      "content": "The theoretical foundation of human-chatbot interaction has evolved significantly as artificial intelligence systems transition from mere tools to active participants in social exchanges. This shift necessitates rethinking traditional interaction models, which have historically centered on human-human dynamics. The emergence of chatbots as autonomous agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and responding in socially nuanced ways demands a new theoretical lens that accounts for the hybrid nature of these interactions. Researchers have begun to explore how chatbots influence communication patterns, social norms, and even emotional engagement, challenging conventional assumptions about agency and intentionality in interaction. These developments highlight the need for a robust theoretical framework that bridges computational models with sociocultural contexts.\n\nCentral to this theorizing is the recognition that human-chatbot interactions are not static but dynamically shaped by contextual factors, user expectations, and the chatbot’s design characteristics. Theoretical approaches have drawn from disciplines such as communication theory, social psychology, and human-computer interaction to explain how users perceive and respond to chatbots. Key concepts include the illusion of social presence, the role of conversational agents in shaping user behavior, and the ethical implications of designing systems that mimic human interaction. These theories emphasize the importance of understanding the interplay between technical capabilities and human interpretive processes, as chatbots increasingly engage in tasks that require empathy, adaptability, and contextual awareness.\n\nDespite these advances, significant gaps remain in the theoretical understanding of human-chatbot interactions, particularly in long-term and complex social scenarios. Current models often fail to capture the evolving nature of these relationships or the broader societal impacts of widespread chatbot integration. Future research must address these limitations by developing more comprehensive frameworks that incorporate longitudinal data, diverse user populations, and interdisciplinary perspectives. Such efforts will be critical in ensuring that the theoretical underpinnings of human-chatbot interaction keep pace with the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and its growing role in everyday life.",

      "level": 3,
      "content": "Stigmatization patterns in LLM-generated narratives reveal systematic biases that reflect and reinforce societal prejudices, often through the amplification of marginalized identities. These models, trained on vast datasets, can inadvertently internalize and propagate harmful stereotypes, particularly when generating narratives around mental health, race, or socioeconomic status [5]. The emergence of such patterns is not always intentional but arises from the complex interplay of data distribution, training objectives, and the model's capacity for recursive generation. This leads to the creation of narratives that not only mirror existing social inequities but also deepen them by presenting them as normalized or justified.\n\nEmpirical studies indicate that stigmatizing content in LLM outputs is often concentrated around specific social groups, with mental health entities being particularly vulnerable. These narratives tend to cluster in distinct social graph structures, where stigmatizing language converges and intensifies. The clustering suggests that such content is not randomly distributed but is instead shaped by underlying community dynamics and the model's interaction with prior linguistic patterns. This phenomenon is exacerbated in environments where generative models engage in recursive content creation, leading to self-reinforcing cycles of bias and misinformation.\n\nThe evolution of stigmatization in LLM-generated narratives is influenced by both the model's training data and the context in which it operates. As models interact with user inputs and generate new content, they can either mitigate or exacerbate existing biases depending on the feedback loops they encounter. Understanding these dynamics is critical for developing mitigation strategies that address not only the immediate outputs but also the structural factors that enable the persistence of stigmatizing narratives. This calls for a multidisciplinary approach that integrates sociological, computational, and ethical perspectives to ensure responsible AI development.",

      "content": "Long-term user dynamics and social interactions represent a critical dimension of human–machine interaction, where the evolving nature of user behavior and social relationships shapes the effectiveness and adaptability of technological systems. As digital platforms and AI-driven services become more integrated into daily life, understanding how users form, maintain, and modify social connections over time becomes essential. This includes examining how individuals adapt to changing interfaces, respond to algorithmic recommendations, and engage in collaborative or competitive behaviors within networked environments. The complexity of these dynamics necessitates models that account for both individual agency and collective patterns, enabling systems to respond to shifting user needs and social contexts.\n\nThe interplay between long-term user behavior and social interactions is further complicated by the influence of external factors such as cultural norms, institutional policies, and technological affordances. These elements collectively shape how users perceive and interact with technology, often leading to emergent social practices that were not initially anticipated by system designers. For instance, the adoption of recommendation algorithms can alter content consumption habits, influence social validation mechanisms, and even redefine community boundaries. As a result, the design of interactive systems must incorporate mechanisms for continuous learning and adaptation, ensuring that they remain aligned with the evolving expectations and behaviors of their user base.\n\nMoreover, the study of long-term user dynamics and social interactions is increasingly informed by computational models and simulation frameworks that replicate real-world behavioral patterns. These tools allow researchers to test hypotheses about user engagement, trust formation, and social influence in controlled environments. By integrating data from diverse sources, such models can provide insights into how different design choices affect user retention, community cohesion, and overall system performance. This line of inquiry is vital for developing resilient and socially aware technologies that can sustain meaningful interactions over extended periods.",

      "level": 3,
      "content": "Coarse and fine-grained representation consistency refers to the alignment between high-level abstract features and detailed, specific features within a model’s internal representation. This concept is critical for ensuring that models maintain coherent and stable interpretations of input data across different levels of abstraction. Coarse-grained consistency ensures that high-level concepts, such as object categories or semantic roles, remain aligned with input data, while fine-grained consistency focuses on the alignment of more specific features, such as spatial relationships or syntactic structures. Achieving this dual consistency is essential for robust model behavior, particularly in tasks involving multimodal inputs or complex reasoning, where mismatches at either level can lead to erroneous outputs or misinterpretations.\n\nThe challenge in maintaining this consistency lies in the dynamic and often non-linear nature of model representations. Real-world data introduces variability and complexity that can disrupt the alignment between different levels of abstraction. Techniques such as concept shift analysis and representation projection are employed to measure and monitor these consistencies, often by comparing representations before and after model updates or interventions. These methods help identify when and how representations diverge, enabling targeted corrections. However, the scalability and reliability of such approaches remain limited, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional and sparse representations, which are common in modern deep learning architectures.\n\nTo address these limitations, recent research has explored frameworks that integrate both coarse and fine-grained alignment metrics into a unified evaluation mechanism. These frameworks aim to provide a more holistic view of representation consistency, capturing both global and local alignment properties. By combining techniques such as concept activation vectors (CAVs) and sparse autoencoders (SAEs), researchers can extract and compare intrinsic representations, offering insights into how models process and transform information. This dual-level analysis not only enhances the interpretability of model behavior but also supports the development of more reliable and aligned AI systems.",

      "level": 3,
      "content": "Preference rigidity and goal persistence are critical dimensions of agency in AI systems, reflecting the degree to which models maintain stable preferences and adhere to long-term objectives despite environmental and internal pressures [6]. These traits are essential for ensuring that AI systems remain aligned with human values and operational goals over time. However, current AI architectures often exhibit limited flexibility in adapting to new information while maintaining consistency in their core objectives. This tension between adaptability and stability is exacerbated by the structural constraints of training paradigms, which prioritize short-term performance metrics over long-term coherence. As a result, AI systems may struggle to reconcile evolving contextual demands with their foundational design, leading to suboptimal or misaligned behavior in complex, dynamic environments.\n\nThe persistence of goals in AI systems is further complicated by the interplay of cognitive biases, institutional incentives, and infrastructural limitations that shape the development and deployment of AI technologies. These factors contribute to a systemic resistance to recursive self-correction, where models are less likely to revise their internal representations or decision-making processes even when confronted with contradictory evidence. This rigidity can manifest in the form of overfitting to specific training data, failure to generalize across novel scenarios, or an inability to incorporate feedback that would improve alignment with human intentions. Moreover, the lack of robust interpretability mechanisms hinders the ability to diagnose and address such issues, reinforcing a cycle of limited adaptability and persistent misalignment.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a reevaluation of how agency is conceptualized and operationalized within AI systems [4]. By integrating mechanisms that allow for dynamic preference adjustment while preserving core objectives, future AI systems could achieve a more balanced approach to goal persistence. This would involve not only technical innovations in model architecture and training but also a broader rethinking of the evaluation frameworks used to assess AI performance. Such efforts are essential for ensuring that AI systems remain both reliable and aligned with human interests over time, particularly as their capabilities continue to expand into increasingly complex and high-stakes domains.",

These architectures integrate modular components such as perception, reasoning, and action, enabling agents to simulate human-like decision-making while maintaining transparency. By leveraging large language models (LLMs), these systems can process and interpret unstructured data, such as policy terms, claims history, and risk factors, to generate actionable insights. The integration of interpretability mechanisms within these architectures ensures that decisions are not only accurate but also explainable, which is critical for regulatory compliance and stakeholder trust. This design allows for the systematic evaluation of agent behavior, aligning with the need for verifiable causal evidence in insurance contexts.\n\nRecent advancements have emphasized the importance of embedding audit hooks and provenance tracking within agent architectures to support governance and accountability [7]. These features enable the tracing of decision pathways, ensuring that each step in the risk assessment process is documented and reviewable. Furthermore, the use of multi-layered interpretability frameworks forces agents to articulate their reasoning explicitly, breaking down decisions into input analysis, rule activation, and decision pathways [8]. This transparency is essential for identifying biases, evaluating performance against established benchmarks, and detecting failure modes that could lead to adverse outcomes. By incorporating automated evaluation frameworks, these agents can continuously monitor their own behavior, improving reliability and reducing the risk of misaligned outcomes.\n\nThe application of agent architectures in insurance simulations also extends to the modeling of complex epistemic structures, such as the interplay between policyholder behavior, market dynamics, and regulatory constraints. These agents can simulate various scenarios, including claim processing, fraud detection, and risk mitigation, providing insurers with a robust tool for scenario planning and decision support. The modular nature of these systems allows for flexibility in adapting to different insurance domains, from property and casualty to health and life insurance.

As models grow in scale and sophistication, traditional XAI methods often struggle to maintain reliability and scalability, leading to a mismatch between the complexity of the models and the depth of their interpretability. This gap is exacerbated by the fact that many XAI metrics are designed for simpler architectures and fail to capture the nuanced decision-making processes of modern deep learning systems. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop metrics that are both robust to model complexity and capable of providing meaningful insights into the internal workings of AI systems.\n\nA key aspect of bridging this gap lies in rethinking the design of XAI metrics to align with the structural and functional characteristics of complex models. This involves moving beyond post-hoc explanations and toward metrics that are integrated into the model development lifecycle, ensuring that interpretability is not an afterthought but a foundational component.

The robust equilibrium investment strategy is composed of a myopic component and a hedging demand, both of which are influenced by competitive pressures [10]. This dual structure reflects the interplay between short-term decision-making and long-term risk mitigation, where insurers must balance immediate returns with the need to hedge against potential market downturns. The equilibrium reinsurance strategy, on the other hand, is implicitly defined by two key components, one of which relates to the purchase of proportional reinsurance, highlighting the strategic trade-offs insurers face in managing risk exposure.\n\nThe analysis reveals that competition significantly alters the equilibrium strategies of insurers, as each player's decisions are influenced by the anticipated actions of others [10]. This leads to a dynamic equilibrium where strategies evolve in response to shifting market conditions and the strategic behavior of competitors. The presence of worst-case scenarios further complicates the decision-making process, as insurers must account for the most adverse outcomes when formulating their strategies. This results in a more conservative approach, with increased emphasis on risk hedging and robustness against uncertainty.\n\nFurthermore, the study demonstrates that the equilibrium strategies derived under the mean-variance criterion provide a framework for understanding how insurers adjust their investment and reinsurance policies in response to competitive dynamics.

Traditional models often assume constant mortality rates, leading to exponential survival distributions, which simplify the problem but lack realism. Recent studies have relaxed this assumption, incorporating age-dependent force of mortality and considering the interplay between annuitization, labor income, and investment decisions. These approaches aim to balance the trade-off between investment growth and the need for long-term income security, particularly for retirees facing uncertain lifespans. The integration of dynamic programming and stochastic control techniques allows for the derivation of optimal strategies that adapt to changing mortality and financial market conditions.\n\nThe analysis of optimal annuity strategies also considers the impact of risk aversion and ambiguity aversion on decision-making [10]. Both coefficients influence the trade-off between risk exposure and income security, with similar effects observed in insurer and individual decision-making frameworks. By adopting a mean-variance criterion instead of the conventional CARA utility function, the models capture non-linear relationships between risk and return, offering a more nuanced perspective on optimal strategies. This shift enables a more realistic assessment of how individuals and insurers balance financial risks against the need for stable income. The resulting strategies are sensitive to the structure of mortality risk, the volatility of financial markets, and the interdependencies between different risk factors.\n\nIn the context of systemic risk and portfolio diversification, optimal annuity strategies must also account for the broader implications of mortality risk on insurance portfolios. Asymptotic characterizations of total loss distributions, derived through central limit theorems, provide theoretical support for approximating risk in large portfolios [11]. These results are crucial for risk management, particularly in scenarios involving interdependent insurance and financial risks.

The integration of jump processes allows for a more robust assessment of potential losses, ensuring that reserves are adequately set to absorb unexpected shocks.\n\nIn the context of premium reserves, jump processes also influence the determination of fair pure premiums by introducing additional layers of uncertainty. Stochastic extensions, such as replacing calendar time with a gamma stochastic clock or incorporating Brownian motion and jump processes, provide a more realistic framework for modeling epidemic-related risks.

This issue is particularly prevalent in mean-variance optimization, where the objective function is not time-consistent, leading to suboptimal strategies over time. To address this, the paper adopts the time-consistent equilibrium strategy proposed by Björk et al.

By employing this approach, the study effectively mitigates the time inconsistency inherent in the mean-variance criterion, enabling more reliable long-term decision-making under uncertainty.\n\nThe paper further extends this framework by incorporating model uncertainty into the optimization process, distinguishing it from existing literature that primarily focuses on deterministic or risk-neutral settings. This is achieved by formulating the problem as a maxmin optimization, where the insurer seeks to minimize the worst-case expected utility over a set of plausible models. The introduction of the $4/2$ stochastic volatility model and robust mean-field game dynamics adds complexity to the system, necessitating the development of new analytical tools to ensure the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium strategies. These strategies are derived under a weak dependence structure among random variables, allowing for both independent and arbitrarily dependent components, thus capturing a broader range of real-world interactions.\n\nFinally, the study explores the asymptotic behavior of key risk measures, such as total losses and ruin probabilities, under the bivariate regular varying (BRV) distribution.

Traditional risk measures often assume independence or simple correlations, which may not adequately reflect the true nature of systemic risks in modern financial systems. The integration of model uncertainty and relative performance considerations in robust investment-reinsurance strategies highlights the need for more sophisticated risk metrics that account for both common and idiosyncratic risks. These measures are essential for understanding how risks propagate through interconnected markets and institutions, particularly in the context of multi-portfolio risk management and systemic stability.\n\nRecent developments in multivariate risk modeling emphasize the importance of considering asymptotic dependence conditions and the behavior of risk measures such as joint expected shortfall under different structures [12]. The study of Brownian risk variation (BRV) and its closure properties for dependent risk pairs provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing the tail behavior of combined risks. This is particularly relevant in the insurance sector, where the interdependence between insurance and financial risks can significantly impact solvency and profitability [13]. By incorporating these interdependencies, risk measures become more accurate and reflective of real-world conditions, enabling better-informed decision-making.\n\nThe application of probabilistic interacting particle models and jointly exchangeable arrays offers a novel framework for systemic risk modeling, extending classical collective risk models to capture interactions and dependencies [11]. These models, supported by central limit theorems and simulation-based validation, provide a robust basis for approximating total losses in large portfolios over extended time horizons [11]. Such approaches are crucial for developing effective risk management strategies that address the complexities of interdependent risks, ultimately contributing to enhanced financial stability in the face of uncertainty and systemic shocks.",

      "level": 3,
      "content": "The section on mean-field equilibrium under ambiguity explores the strategic interactions among a large number of insurers facing model uncertainty and volatility risk, under the mean-variance criterion. By extending the framework of robust time-consistent equilibrium strategies, the analysis incorporates a $4/2$ stochastic volatility model and accounts for ambiguity in the underlying dynamics. The equilibrium is characterized through a system of coupled Riccati equations, which govern the optimal strategies of individual insurers. Sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of these equations are established, ensuring the robustness of the equilibrium solution. The formulation also addresses the interplay between risk aversion, competition levels, and ambiguity, highlighting how these factors influence the strategic behavior of insurers in a mean-field setting [10].\n\nThe convergence of results from the $n$-insurer game to the mean-field equilibrium is rigorously analyzed, demonstrating that as the number of insurers grows large, the strategies and outcomes of the finite-player game approach those of the mean-field game [10]. This convergence is essential for validating the applicability of mean-field approximations in practical scenarios involving a large population of competitive agents. The analysis shows that the equilibrium strategies in the mean-field limit retain the key features of the finite-player case, such as the dependence on risk aversion and the impact of model uncertainty. This provides a theoretical foundation for using mean-field models to study complex insurance markets with many participants.\n\nNumerical examples are presented to illustrate the effects of varying parameters such as competition level, risk aversion coefficients, and ambiguity on the equilibrium strategies and financial outcomes. These examples reveal that increased ambiguity leads to more conservative strategies, while higher competition intensifies the need for optimal risk-sharing mechanisms. The results also highlight the sensitivity of the equilibrium to the structure of the volatility model and the degree of interdependence among insurers. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the mean-field equilibrium under ambiguity, this section contributes to a deeper understanding of robust decision-making in competitive insurance markets [10].",

      "content": "Despite significant advancements in understanding AI behavior from a sociological perspective, several critical limitations remain unaddressed. One major limitation is the lack of comprehensive frameworks that integrate both technical and sociological dimensions of AI behavior in real-world settings. Current research often focuses on isolated aspects, such as decision-making processes or trust dynamics, without fully considering the interplay between these elements within complex social systems. Additionally, the evaluation of AI systems for fairness, transparency, and accountability remains largely theoretical, with limited empirical validation in diverse and dynamic environments. Furthermore, the long-term societal impacts of AI-driven decision-making, particularly in domains like insurance, remain underexplored, with few studies addressing the evolving nature of human-AI interactions over time.\n\nFuture research should prioritize the development of integrated frameworks that bridge technical and sociological perspectives, enabling a more holistic understanding of AI behavior. This includes the creation of dynamic models that account for the evolving nature of human-AI interactions and the societal contexts in which they occur. Researchers should also focus on the empirical validation of fairness and accountability mechanisms, particularly in high-stakes domains such as insurance, where AI-driven decisions can have significant consequences for individuals and communities. Additionally, there is a need for longitudinal studies that examine how AI systems influence and are influenced by social norms, values, and behaviors over extended periods. These studies should incorporate diverse data sources and methodologies to ensure robust and generalizable findings.\n\nThe proposed future work has the potential to significantly advance the responsible development and deployment of AI systems. By addressing the limitations in current research, the proposed directions can contribute to the creation of more transparent, equitable, and socially aligned AI systems. Improved frameworks for evaluating AI behavior can enhance the trustworthiness of AI-driven decision-making, particularly in critical sectors such as insurance, where fairness and accountability are paramount. Moreover, longitudinal studies on human-AI interactions can provide valuable insights into the long-term societal impacts of AI, informing policy and regulatory strategies. Ultimately, these efforts can help ensure that AI systems not only perform effectively but also align with human values and contribute to a more just and sustainable society.",

      "content": "This survey paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the sociological dimensions of AI behavior, focusing on how AI systems interact with human actors and the broader implications of these interactions. The study highlights the emergence of social structures and norms within decentralized agent systems, emphasizing the role of reciprocity in maintaining stable and cooperative interactions. It also explores theoretical models of decision-making, particularly the interplay between grit and financial support in shaping strategic outcomes. Empirical and qualitative approaches to AI trustworthiness are examined, revealing the growing importance of risk management and the need for proactive governance frameworks. The integration of sociological and computational perspectives is further explored through human-chatbot interaction, stigmatization patterns in AI-generated narratives, and the long-term dynamics of user behavior in social graph modeling. These findings collectively underscore the need to consider not only the technical performance of AI systems but also their sociological and ethical implications.\n\nThe significance of this survey lies in its interdisciplinary approach, which bridges the gap between technical AI development and sociological analysis. By integrating theoretical, empirical, and computational perspectives, the paper advances the discussion on behavior-based insurance and its broader societal impact. It emphasizes the importance of addressing ethical and sociological concerns in AI development, advocating for the creation of systems that are not only technically robust but also socially aligned. This work contributes to the ongoing dialogue on responsible AI development, offering a framework for understanding how AI systems shape and are shaped by social contexts. The insights presented here are particularly relevant in the insurance sector, where AI-driven decision-making processes must be carefully aligned with human values and social norms to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability.\n\nAs AI systems become increasingly integrated into social and economic structures, there is a pressing need for continued research and collaboration across disciplines. Future studies should focus on developing robust frameworks for managing decentralized agent interactions, ensuring that AI systems are designed with ethical and sociological considerations in mind. Additionally, there is a need to enhance the transparency and interpretability of AI systems, particularly in high-stakes domains such as insurance and finance. Policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders must work together to establish guidelines that promote responsible AI development and address the challenges of bias, fairness, and accountability. By fostering a deeper understanding of AI behavior through interdisciplinary collaboration, we can ensure that AI technologies serve the broader interests of society while maintaining trust and integrity.",
