As the complexity of these systems increases, so does the need for advanced theoretical and computational tools to unravel their intricate behaviors. The emergence of non-thermal states, such as quantum many-body scars (QMBS), has challenged traditional notions of thermalization and highlighted the role of symmetry, conservation laws, and Hilbert space fragmentation in shaping the dynamics of quantum systems [2]. These phenomena, often observed in strongly correlated and constrained systems, have sparked significant interest in understanding the conditions under which non-ergodic behavior persists and how such states can be manipulated or harnessed for quantum technologies [3].\n\nThis survey paper focuses on the interplay between quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation, with an emphasis on the theoretical and numerical techniques used to study these phenomena [4]. It explores the structural and dynamical properties of fragmented Hilbert spaces, the role of conserved quantities and symmetry in defining Krylov subspaces, and the emergence of non-thermal eigenstates [5]. The paper also examines experimental realizations in cold-atom and Rydberg-atom systems, as well as the implications of these findings for quantum simulation and information processing [6]. By synthesizing current research, the survey provides a comprehensive overview of the key concepts, methods, and challenges in the study of quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation [7].\n\nThe paper begins with an analysis of Hilbert space characterization and subspace analysis, focusing on spectral and structural properties of quantum systems. It details the role of exact diagonalization and matrix product state techniques in probing the low-energy spectrum and entanglement structure of many-body systems. The discussion then extends to algebraic factorization and commutant algebra structures, which provide a mathematical framework for understanding the decomposition of Hilbert spaces into dynamically disconnected subspaces. The paper next addresses the dynamical properties of these subspaces, including Krylov subspace imprinting, thermalization restrictions, and spectral embedding. It explores how these features contribute to the emergence of quantum many-body scars and the breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis [2]. The final section of this part examines the construction of invariant subspaces, including tree structures in Fock space and the role of restricted spectrum generating algebras in defining partially solvable models.\n\nThis survey paper makes several key contributions to the field of quantum many-body physics [8]. It provides a systematic overview of the theoretical and numerical methods used to study quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation, offering a unified perspective on the interplay between symmetry, conservation laws, and non-thermal dynamics [4]. By synthesizing recent advances in both theoretical and experimental research, the paper highlights the significance of these phenomena in understanding the limits of thermalization in isolated quantum systems [9]. Furthermore, it identifies open questions and potential directions for future research, including the development of more efficient computational tools and the exploration of novel quantum systems with tailored dynamical properties. These contributions aim to advance the understanding of non-ergodic behavior in quantum many-body systems and its implications for quantum information science [4].",

      "content": "Exact diagonalization (ED) and matrix product state (MPS) techniques are fundamental numerical tools for studying quantum many-body systems, particularly in the context of strongly correlated and low-dimensional systems. ED involves direct computation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian matrix, providing exact solutions for small system sizes. This method is especially useful for analyzing ground states, excited states, and spectral properties, but its applicability is limited by the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size. In contrast, MPS techniques, rooted in the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), offer a more scalable approach by representing quantum states as a tensor network with a controlled bond dimension. This allows for efficient simulation of one-dimensional systems and captures entanglement structures that are critical for understanding quantum dynamics and phase transitions.\n\nBoth methods have been instrumental in uncovering the intricate behavior of quantum systems, such as the emergence of quantum many-body scars (QMBS) and the phenomenon of Hilbert space fragmentation [7]. ED is often used to identify zero-energy states and their properties, while MPS techniques enable the study of time evolution and the characterization of entanglement dynamics. These techniques are particularly valuable in systems where exact solutions are not available, such as in the PXP model or other kinetically constrained models. By leveraging the strengths of both approaches, researchers can gain insights into the interplay between entanglement, thermalization, and non-thermal dynamics in complex quantum systems [5].\n\nRecent advancements have extended the utility of these methods by integrating them with symmetry-based analyses and efficient state preparation strategies. For instance, the identification of SU(M) representations within the nullspace of certain Hamiltonians has provided a framework for understanding the structure of fragmented Hilbert spaces. Additionally, the use of MPS techniques for simulating large systems with controlled accuracy has enabled the exploration of phenomena such as slow thermalization and persistent oscillations in local observables. These developments highlight the critical role of ED and MPS in advancing the theoretical and computational understanding of quantum complexity and non-thermal dynamics in many-body systems.",

      "content": "Algebraic factorization and commutant algebra structures play a central role in understanding the decomposition of Hilbert spaces in quantum many-body systems, particularly in the context of Hilbert space fragmentation. The commutant algebra, defined as the set of operators that commute with the Hamiltonian, provides a mathematical framework to characterize the structure of Krylov subspaces [10]. This algebraic structure reveals how the Hilbert space can be partitioned into dynamically disconnected sectors, each governed by distinct dynamical rules. The presence of conserved quantities and symmetries further influences this decomposition, as they can lead to the emergence of fragmented subspaces that do not fully adhere to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). These subspaces often exhibit non-ergodic behavior, with eigenstates that are localized or exhibit reduced thermalization properties [9].\n\nThe interplay between the commutant algebra and the underlying symmetries of the Hamiltonian is crucial for identifying the number and nature of these fragmented subspaces. In systems with nonlocal conserved quantities, the commutant algebra can be significantly enriched, leading to a more complex fragmentation structure. For instance, in models with subsystem symmetries, such as those conserving magnetization along rows and columns of a lattice, the commutant algebra reflects the presence of these conservation laws. This results in a Hilbert space that is partitioned into subspaces with distinct dynamical properties. The algebraic factorization of the Hamiltonian, when possible, further aids in decomposing the system into smaller, more tractable components, each of which can be analyzed independently.\n\nMoreover, the study of commutant algebras provides insights into the emergence of zero modes and other special eigenstates. These states often reside in specific subspaces that are protected by the algebraic structure of the Hamiltonian. The presence of such states can significantly affect the dynamics and thermalization properties of the system. In particular, the commutant algebra can be used to identify subspaces that support quantum many-body scar states (QMBS), which exhibit non-thermal behavior despite the overall complexity of the system. Understanding these algebraic structures is essential for characterizing the interplay between symmetry, conservation laws, and the dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems.",

      "content": "Krylov subspace imprinting plays a critical role in understanding the dynamics and thermalization properties of quantum many-body systems. The structure of Krylov subspaces, defined by the repeated application of the Hamiltonian on an initial state, determines the accessible evolution space of the system. In systems with strong Hilbert space fragmentation, these subspaces can become dynamically disconnected, leading to restricted thermalization [7]. This fragmentation is often linked to the presence of conserved quantities or symmetries that prevent the system from exploring the full Hilbert space [11]. As a result, initial states confined to specific Krylov subspaces may exhibit non-thermal behavior, such as persistent oscillations or slow entanglement growth, even in non-integrable systems [5]. The imprinting of these subspaces thus imposes fundamental constraints on the system's ability to thermalize.\n\nThe restriction of thermalization in certain Krylov subspaces is closely tied to the emergence of quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, which are non-thermal eigenstates embedded within the thermal spectrum [2]. These states often arise from the structure of the Hamiltonian, particularly in systems with partial solvability or specific symmetry properties. The presence of QMBS can lead to a breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in certain subspaces, as these states do not exhibit the typical thermal properties expected of high-energy eigenstates [2]. This phenomenon highlights the importance of Krylov subspace structure in determining the long-time behavior of quantum systems, especially when the subspace contains states with low entanglement or specific correlation patterns that resist thermalization [5].\n\nFurthermore, the statistical dominance of certain Krylov subspaces, particularly those associated with large \"drums\" in the Hilbert space, can significantly influence the thermalization dynamics of typical initial states [11]. These subspaces, characterized by their extensive size, may contain states that do not thermalize with respect to certain observables, such as spin correlations or entanglement entropy. The identification and characterization of these subspaces are essential for understanding the conditions under which non-thermal behavior persists in quantum systems [9]. By analyzing the structure and properties of Krylov subspaces, researchers can gain deeper insights into the mechanisms that govern thermalization and the emergence of non-thermal states in isolated quantum systems [5].",

      "content": "Spectral embedding plays a crucial role in analyzing the structure of fragmented Hilbert spaces, particularly in systems exhibiting symmetry-induced fragmentation [10]. By mapping quantum states into a lower-dimensional spectral space, one can uncover the underlying organization of dynamically disconnected subspaces. This technique is especially powerful when applied to models with kinetic constraints or conserved quantities, as it reveals how the interplay between symmetry and dynamics leads to the emergence of distinct subspaces. The spectral properties of such systems often display a block-diagonal structure, where each block corresponds to a Krylov subspace that remains invariant under the action of the Hamiltonian. This fragmentation is not merely a consequence of local symmetries but is deeply tied to the algebraic structure of the Hamiltonian, particularly the commutant algebra, which governs the number and nature of these subspaces.\n\nSymmetry-induced fragmentation arises when the presence of conserved quantities or specific symmetry operations partitions the Hilbert space into sectors that are dynamically decoupled. These sectors can be further characterized by their spectral properties, which may exhibit either integrable or non-integrable behavior. In some cases, the fragmented subspaces host quantum many-body scars, which are eigenstates that deviate from the typical thermalization behavior predicted by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) [2]. The presence of such scars indicates a weak violation of ETH and is often linked to the interplay between chiral and spatial inversion symmetries. Spectral embedding techniques allow for the identification of these scarred states by highlighting their unique spectral signatures, which persist even in the presence of fragmentation.\n\nThe study of spectral embedding in the context of symmetry-induced fragmentation provides a framework for understanding the complex interplay between dynamics, symmetry, and quantum coherence. By systematically varying parameters such as the strength of kinetic constraints or the presence of conserved quantities, one can observe how the fragmentation structure evolves and how it influences the thermalization properties of the system. This approach not only aids in distinguishing between weak and strong fragmentation but also offers insights into the emergence of non-ergodic behavior in quantum many-body systems [4]. Ultimately, spectral embedding serves as a vital tool for probing the intricate architecture of fragmented Hilbert spaces and their implications for quantum dynamics.",

These structures represent the connectivity of basis states under the action of the Hamiltonian, where each node corresponds to a state and edges denote possible transitions. In systems with kinetic constraints, such as those discussed in the context of the Hamiltonian $ H^{\\mathcal{N}(1)} $, the resulting tree structures often exhibit a hierarchical, fractal-like organization. This organization reflects the presence of dynamically disconnected sectors, where each sector corresponds to a distinct subspace of the full Hilbert space. The tree structure thus serves as a geometric representation of the system's complexity and the constraints governing its evolution.\n\nFock space representations further refine this understanding by encoding the occupation numbers of particles or spins in a structured manner. In models with integrable structures, such as those with hidden symmetry factors (HSF), the Fock space can be decomposed into subspaces that preserve integrability even under perturbations. These subspaces are often defined by irreducible strings or other frozen configurations, which act as building blocks for the overall Hilbert space. The tree structure in such cases can be seen as a mapping of the Fock space, where each level of the tree corresponds to a different configuration of particles or spins. This hierarchical representation is crucial for analyzing the spectral properties and the emergence of non-thermal states, such as quantum many-body scars [8].\n\nThe interplay between tree structures and Fock space representations becomes particularly significant in systems with fragmented Hilbert spaces. Here, the tree structure not only captures the connectivity of states but also reveals the underlying symmetries and conservation laws that govern the system's dynamics. By decomposing the Hilbert space into dynamically disconnected sectors, the tree structure allows for a more granular analysis of the system's behavior. This approach is instrumental in understanding how certain subspaces maintain integrability or exhibit unique spectral features, even when the full system is non-integrable [12]. Such insights are essential for exploring the broader implications of Hilbert space fragmentation in quantum many-body systems [7].",

These algebras define a set of operators that, when restricted to a specific subspace, commute with the Hamiltonian and generate its spectrum. This structure allows for the explicit construction of energy eigenstates within the solvable subspace by applying the spectrum generating operator to a known reference state [12]. The presence of such algebras often indicates the existence of hidden symmetries, which can significantly influence the system's dynamics and thermalization behavior. These symmetries are typically more subtle than conventional ones, emerging from the interplay between the Hamiltonian and the subspace structure.\n\nIn systems exhibiting rSGAs, the restricted Hamiltonian often possesses additional commutation relations that arise from the underlying symmetry. These relations can lead to the emergence of conserved quantities, which in turn affect the system's ergodicity and thermalization properties. When the restricted Hamiltonian is integrable, these conserved quantities may originate from the Yang-Baxter equation, giving rise to an infinite set of commuting transfer matrices [12]. However, in most known cases, the presence of rSGAs does not necessarily imply full integrability, but rather a partial solvability that allows for the identification of specific subspaces with distinct spectral features. This partial solvability is crucial for distinguishing between different Krylov sectors and understanding the complexity-driven resources that govern the system's behavior.\n\nThe role of rSGAs in revealing hidden symmetries is further highlighted by their connection to the commutant algebra, which commutes with the Hamiltonian's generators and plays a key role in structuring the Hilbert space. This algebra often reflects remnants of more fundamental structures, such as the Read-Saleur algebra, and provides a means to classify states based on their symmetry properties. By identifying the nullspace of the Hamiltonian and analyzing its structure, one can uncover the presence of zero-energy eigenstates and other non-thermal features.

These systems leverage strong, tunable interactions between atoms excited to Rydberg states, enabling the simulation of complex spin models with controllable parameters [6]. In particular, the PXP model and its generalizations have been realized in such arrays, where kinetic constraints lead to the formation of Z₂k scarring mechanisms. These mechanisms arise from the interplay between the Rydberg blockade effect and the specific spatial arrangement of atoms, resulting in the emergence of non-thermal eigenstates that violate the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) within specific subspaces of the Hilbert space [11].\n\nThe Z₂k scarring mechanisms represent a generalization of earlier Z₂ scarring observed in cold-atom systems, where the symmetry of the system leads to the formation of distinct Krylov subspaces. In Rydberg atom arrays, these subspaces are characterized by the spatial configuration of Rydberg excitations, which restrict the system's evolution to specific sectors of the Hilbert space [6]. This fragmentation of the Hilbert space leads to a restricted thermalization process, where thermalization occurs within a Krylov subspace but is prevented between different subspaces [5]. Such behavior is a direct manifestation of the Krylov-restricted ETH and highlights the role of symmetry and conservation laws in the emergence of QMBSs.\n\nRecent experimental studies have demonstrated the existence of Z₂k scarring in Rydberg atom arrays, where the system exhibits dynamical revivals and non-thermal eigenstates that persist over long timescales [1]. These observations provide strong evidence for the role of kinetic constraints in generating QMBSs and offer a pathway to explore the interplay between Hilbert space fragmentation and thermalization [2]. The study of Z₂k scarring not only deepens our understanding of weak ergodicity breaking but also opens new avenues for engineering non-thermal states in quantum many-body systems [1].",

These systems can be engineered to exhibit non-thermal behavior through the presence of quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), which are rare eigenstates that do not conform to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) [2]. While the majority of energy eigenstates in these systems thermalize, QMBSs remain localized and display non-ergodic dynamics [2]. This phenomenon has been observed in various cold-atom setups, including Rydberg atom arrays and tilted optical lattices, where the interplay between interactions and external potentials leads to the formation of non-thermal states [6]. The presence of these states challenges the conventional understanding of thermalization in isolated quantum systems and highlights the role of specific symmetries and conservation laws [9].\n\nHilbert space fragmentation is another mechanism contributing to weak ergodicity breaking in cold-atom systems [14]. This occurs when the Hilbert space is divided into dynamically disconnected subspaces, preventing full thermalization [2]. In such cases, the system's evolution is restricted to a subset of the total Hilbert space, leading to the emergence of non-thermal states and slow dynamics. This fragmentation can arise from conservation laws, such as charge or dipole conservation, or from the presence of specific interactions that constrain the system's evolution. Experimental observations in Rydberg atom systems have demonstrated that these fragmented Krylov subspaces can exhibit thermalization within themselves, but not across different subspaces, thereby violating the ETH on a global scale [5].\n\nThe study of weak ergodicity breaking in cold atoms has also revealed the importance of Krylov-restricted thermalization, where thermalization occurs only within specific subspaces of the Hilbert space [5]. This phenomenon has been linked to the presence of conserved quantities and the structure of the underlying Hamiltonian. In particular, the interplay between local interactions and global constraints leads to the emergence of non-thermal eigenstates that persist over long timescales [15]. These findings have significant implications for understanding the limits of thermalization in isolated quantum systems and for designing quantum systems with tailored dynamical properties [9].

This method has been instrumental in uncovering emergent symmetries that govern the low-energy physics of quantum many-body systems. In particular, when applied to models such as the PXP model or tilted Fermi-Hubbard systems, the SW transformation reveals the emergence of approximately conserved quantities that significantly alter the system's dynamical behavior. These emergent symmetries often lead to the formation of non-thermal eigenstates, which are central to the phenomenon of weak ergodicity breaking. The presence of such symmetries can result in the fragmentation of the Hilbert space into dynamically isolated subspaces, where thermalization is restricted or suppressed [9].\n\nThe interplay between SW transformations and emergent symmetries becomes even more intricate when considering nested transformations, which are required to account for additional conserved quantities. These nested SW approaches yield effective Hamiltonians that accurately describe the slow relaxation dynamics observed in systems like Rydberg atom arrays or the AKLT spin chain. The emergence of these symmetries is often linked to algebraic structures such as nearly-SU(2) algebras, which underpin the non-thermal properties of these systems.

These subspaces are not defined by conventional quantum numbers but can be characterized by statistically localized integrals of motion or commutant algebras [10]. The resulting fragmentation significantly affects the system's thermalization dynamics, leading to scenarios where different initial states evolve in markedly different ways under the same Hamiltonian. This phenomenon highlights the profound impact of emergent symmetries on the structure of quantum many-body systems and underscores the importance of SW transformations in uncovering their underlying mechanisms.",

This behavior arises from the interplay between the system's Hamiltonian and the initial state, leading to persistent oscillations or non-ergodic dynamics. In particular, domain wall conservation has been identified as a key mechanism responsible for such freezing in both one- and two-dimensional systems. The conservation of domain walls restricts the system's accessible Hilbert space, preventing full thermalization and resulting in long-lived correlations. This effect is not limited to specific lattice geometries but extends to higher-dimensional systems, where similar conservation laws can lead to analogous dynamical constraints.\n\nMagnetometry in spin systems often relies on the detection of persistent magnetization patterns that arise from non-thermal dynamics. In systems exhibiting dynamical freezing, the magnetization does not equilibrate to the expected thermal value, instead maintaining a memory of the initial state. This behavior is particularly relevant in the context of quantum simulators, where the ability to control and measure magnetization over time provides insight into the underlying dynamics. The persistence of magnetization can be linked to the existence of scarred eigenstates or fragmented Hilbert spaces, which hinder the system's ability to explore the full phase space. These effects are crucial for understanding the limits of thermalization in isolated quantum systems and have implications for quantum information processing and metrology [9].\n\nThe study of dynamical freezing and magnetometry in spin systems also highlights the role of symmetry and conservation laws in shaping the long-time behavior of quantum many-body systems. While the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) predicts thermalization for generic systems, deviations from this behavior, such as those observed in the PXP model or Rydberg atom arrays, indicate the presence of non-thermal eigenstates or fragmented Hilbert spaces [9]. These findings suggest that the interplay between conservation laws, symmetry, and initial conditions can lead to a rich variety of dynamical behaviors. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing new approaches to control and manipulate quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum computing and precision measurement.",

This decomposition enables the study of quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) by isolating subsystems that exhibit long-lived period oscillations and ergodicity-breaking dynamics [1]. When the system is prepared in a specific initial state, such as a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric configuration, the dimerized Hamiltonian allows for the emergence of persistent revivals and nested oscillatory patterns in the fidelity dynamics. These features arise due to the interplay between the two independent subparts, each contributing distinct dynamical signatures that collectively shape the overall behavior of the system.\n\nFidelity oscillations, which quantify the overlap between the initial state and the time-evolved state, reveal critical insights into the post-quench dynamics of the system. In the context of Hamiltonian dimerization, these oscillations exhibit period-renormalized behavior, where the oscillation frequency is modified by the coupling between the isolated subparts [14]. The presence of such oscillations indicates the system's deviation from thermalization, as the dynamics remain confined within a low-entropy subspace. This confinement is a hallmark of QMBS, where the system fails to explore the full Hilbert space and instead remains trapped in a restricted region, leading to non-ergodic behavior and prolonged coherence times [4].\n\nThe interplay between Hamiltonian dimerization and fidelity oscillations is further influenced by external parameters such as detuning and interaction strength.

In systems where such protections are absent, quasiparticles typically exhibit rapid decay, leading to thermalization. However, in certain models, such as the PXP model, quasiparticles can remain stable at finite temperatures due to the presence of exact algebraic structures or constraints. This stability is critical for experimental realizations, as it enables the observation of non-ergodic dynamics in quantum hardware, offering new pathways for quantum simulation and computation.\n\nConstructive model building complements quasiparticle approaches by focusing on the design of Hamiltonians that explicitly encode the desired quasiparticle properties. This involves engineering systems with specific symmetries, interactions, or constraints that lead to the emergence of long-lived quasiparticles. For example, models with conserved quantities or those that exhibit many-body localization can support quasiparticle-like excitations that resist decay. In the PXP model, the interplay between local constraints and the absence of certain decay channels results in a unique quasiparticle structure, which can be harnessed for quantum information tasks.

Unlike ground-state dynamics, where scarring is often observed in isolated systems, finite-temperature quenches reveal a more complex interplay between thermalization and non-thermal features. In the PXP model, the initial state's thermal fluctuations can significantly alter the scarring dynamics, leading to a breakdown of the simple ground-state approximation of the Loschmidt echo [13]. This suggests that the presence of thermal noise can either suppress or enhance scarring, depending on the specific parameters of the system and the nature of the initial state. The PXP model's unique structure, characterized by a combination of hard-core bosonic interactions and a specific symmetry, plays a key role in determining how scars respond to temperature.\n\nAt finite temperatures, the thermal distribution of states introduces a broader range of energy contributions, which can interfere with the coherent dynamics typically associated with scars. However, the PXP model exhibits a peculiar resilience where certain scarred states persist even in the presence of thermal noise. This is attributed to the model's underlying structure, which supports a set of low-entanglement, long-lived states that are less susceptible to thermalization. These states maintain their coherence over extended periods, leading to more pronounced scarring signatures than expected from a purely thermalized system. The interplay between the system's energy landscape and the initial state's thermal distribution determines the extent to which these scars remain stable.\n\nThe thermal stability of quantum scars in the PXP model has significant implications for experimental realizations and quantum simulation protocols. As temperature increases, the fidelity of state preparation decreases, potentially affecting the observation of scarring.

This includes the refinement of tensor network techniques, such as matrix product states and projected entangled pair states, to handle larger systems with greater accuracy. Additionally, the integration of machine learning algorithms with traditional computational approaches could enable the discovery of new patterns and structures in fragmented Hilbert spaces. Another promising direction is the exploration of novel quantum systems with tailored dynamical properties, such as those with engineered symmetries or conservation laws, which could lead to the emergence of robust QMBS.
