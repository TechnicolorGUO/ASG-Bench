Unlike Hermitian systems, where the Hamiltonian is symmetric and energy is conserved, non-Hermitian systems introduce asymmetry through gain and loss mechanisms, leading to complex energy spectra and novel physical phenomena [1]. Among these, the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) stands out as a paradigm-shifting concept, where a macroscopic number of eigenstates localize at the boundaries under open boundary conditions, fundamentally altering the bulk-boundary correspondence [2]. This phenomenon is not merely a consequence of disorder but arises from the intrinsic asymmetry in system parameters, offering new pathways for manipulating wave propagation and energy localization. The interplay between non-Hermitian effects and topological properties has further enriched the landscape, giving rise to robust boundary states and enhanced sensitivity in physical systems [3]. These developments have profound implications for both fundamental physics and potential applications in quantum technologies, where the control of energy flow and the emergence of topological states are of critical importance.\n\nThis survey paper focuses on the non-Hermitian skin effect in physics, exploring its theoretical foundations, experimental realizations, and practical implications across various domains [4]. The paper delves into the unique properties of non-Hermitian systems, such as the breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence, the emergence of robust boundary states, and the interplay between non-Hermitian effects and topological invariants [5]. It examines the role of computational modeling in understanding wave propagation and energy localization in non-Hermitian systems, as well as the influence of geodesic structures and synthetic dimensions on the NHSE. Additionally, the paper investigates the impact of non-Hermitian effects on graph structures, field theories, and photonic systems, highlighting the versatility and complexity of these phenomena. Through a comprehensive analysis of these topics, this survey provides a unified perspective on the current state of research and the future directions in the field of non-Hermitian physics [6].\n\nThe paper presents a detailed overview of the key themes explored in the sections between the introduction and the future directions. It begins by discussing the computational modeling of non-Hermitian dislocations, focusing on wave propagation and energy localization in systems with gain and loss. The interplay between non-Hermitian effects and topological properties is then examined, highlighting the emergence of robust boundary states and the role of non-Bloch topology in systems with curved or hyperbolic geometries [3]. The paper also explores the behavior of the NHSE in graph structures, emphasizing the impact of power partition and the pure skin effect on the localization of eigenmodes. Additionally, it investigates the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems in field theories, such as the Skyrme model, and the role of controllable parameters in shaping the localization properties of eigenmodes in photonic systems. The discussion extends to the study of non-Hermitian effects in lossy and metamaterial systems, where quantized decay charges and algebraic skin effects are observed. The paper also covers the adiabatic manipulation of corner states and light funneling in non-Hermitian photonic systems, as well as the interplay between electronic correlations and boundary localization in non-Hermitian models [7]. The role of experimental platforms, such as silicon waveguides and photonic quantum walks, in realizing non-Hermitian effects is also highlighted [8]. Finally, the paper explores the spectral and dynamical properties of non-Hermitian systems under symmetry constraints, the impact of nonlinearity on the dynamics of non-Hermitian models, and the role of topological invariants in characterizing non-Hermitian systems [9].\n\nThis survey paper makes several important contributions to the field of non-Hermitian physics [6].

These systems exhibit unique phenomena such as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where a macroscopic number of eigenmodes localize at the boundaries under open boundary conditions, leading to a breakdown of the traditional bulk-boundary correspondence [2]. This effect is not merely a consequence of disorder but arises from the intrinsic asymmetry in the system's parameters, which can be tuned to control the localization length and the spatial distribution of energy. Such behavior has profound implications for wave dynamics, as it enables the manipulation of energy flow and the emergence of robust boundary states that are not present in Hermitian counterparts.\n\nThe interplay between non-Hermitian effects and topological properties further enriches the landscape of wave propagation, giving rise to novel transport mechanisms and enhanced sensitivity in physical systems [3]. For instance, the NHSE can be harnessed to guide waves along specific paths, enabling reconfigurable light routing and unidirectional invisibility. Additionally, the presence of non-Hermitian skin modes can significantly influence the behavior of many-body systems, where the competition between gain, loss, and interactions leads to complex energy localization patterns [4]. These effects are particularly pronounced in systems with asymmetric hopping or spatially varying gain-loss distributions, where the localization of eigenstates becomes highly sensitive to the system's geometry and boundary conditions.\n\nRecent advances in theoretical and computational methods, such as real-space dynamical mean-field theory (R-DMFT), have enabled a deeper investigation into the role of non-Hermiticity in many-body systems. These approaches allow for the study of correlated non-Hermitian models, where the NHSE coexists with strong electron correlations, leading to new phases of matter. The robustness of non-Hermitian skin modes against disorder and their scaling behavior with system size provide critical insights into the stability and universality of these phenomena [4]. Overall, the study of wave propagation and energy localization in non-Hermitian systems continues to reveal new paradigms in both fundamental physics and potential applications in quantum technologies.",

      "content": "The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) fundamentally alters the behavior of eigenstates in open systems, leading to their localization at system boundaries under open boundary conditions [10]. This phenomenon challenges the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence and is deeply influenced by the interplay of gain and loss, as well as the geometry of the system. In the context of geodesic structures, such as curved or hyperbolic lattices, the NHSE manifests through unique boundary localization patterns that deviate from traditional Euclidean configurations [2]. The spatial curvature introduces additional complexity, modifying the scaling behavior of skin modes and their sensitivity to boundary conditions. This non-local behavior is particularly pronounced in systems where the boundary geometry is not aligned with the natural symmetry of the lattice, leading to emergent topological features that are not present in flat systems.\n\nBoundary conditions play a critical role in determining the extent and nature of the NHSE along geodesics. In systems with synthetic temporal dimensions, dynamic control over gain and loss allows for the manipulation of skin modes in real time, enabling the reconfiguration of boundary-localized states. This dynamic tuning is especially effective in photonic systems where time-multiplexed light pulses can be used to simulate time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. As a result, the NHSE can be selectively enhanced or suppressed, offering a pathway to engineer topological phases with tailored boundary properties. The interplay between temporal modulation and spatial geometry further enriches the complexity of the skin effect, leading to novel phenomena such as non-Bloch topological invariants and phase transitions that depend on the system's boundary structure [7].\n\nThe study of NHSE along geodesics also highlights the importance of non-Bloch topology in non-Hermitian systems [11]. Unlike conventional topological invariants, which rely on periodic boundary conditions, non-Bloch invariants account for the effects of open boundaries and curvature [12]. This leads to a redefinition of topological protection in systems with non-trivial geometries, where the localization of eigenstates is governed by the interplay of curvature, boundary conditions, and non-Hermitian parameters. The resulting skin modes exhibit distinct scaling behaviors, which can be analyzed through finite-size effects and boundary localization [2]. These insights provide a deeper understanding of how non-Hermitian systems respond to geometric and dynamic perturbations, paving the way for future applications in photonic and quantum technologies [1].",

This phenomenon fundamentally alters the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence, leading to a breakdown of the standard topological invariants [12]. In graph systems, the localization is not only dependent on the topology of the network but also on the distribution of non-Hermitian parameters across the nodes and edges. The power partition among different regions of the graph determines the extent and direction of the skin effect, with asymmetric gain-loss profiles amplifying the localization at specific boundaries. This behavior is particularly pronounced in non-Bloch systems, where the eigenmodes exhibit strong sensitivity to boundary conditions and spatial configurations [13].\n\nThe pure skin effect in graph structures emerges when the system is engineered to minimize extraneous boundary effects, allowing the intrinsic non-Hermitian properties to dominate [4]. This requires precise control over the coupling strengths and the placement of gain and loss elements within the graph. In such cases, the skin modes are distinct from trivial boundary states, as they exhibit a unique dependence on the system's finite size and the underlying graph topology [2]. The scaling behavior of the skin effect with system size provides critical insights into the robustness and universality of the phenomenon. By isolating the pure skin effect, researchers can better understand the fundamental mechanisms governing non-Hermitian dynamics in structured networks.\n\nThe study of power partition and the pure skin effect in graph structures has significant implications for the design of novel photonic and electronic systems. By leveraging the controllability of non-Hermitian parameters, it becomes possible to engineer systems with tailored localization properties, enabling applications in reconfigurable waveguiding, enhanced sensing, and topological energy transfer. The interplay between graph geometry, non-Hermitian couplings, and boundary conditions offers a rich framework for exploring new physical phenomena. Understanding these aspects is essential for advancing the theoretical and practical applications of non-Hermitian systems in complex networked structures.",

      "content": "The Skyrme model, originally formulated to describe nuclear matter using solitonic configurations of pion fields, has found unexpected relevance in the study of non-Hermitian systems. When extended to anisotropic media, the model provides a framework for understanding how topological defects can interact with non-Hermitian gain and loss mechanisms. This interaction leads to the emergence of non-Hermitian funneling, where energy or particles are directed toward specific regions of the medium, akin to a dynamic localization process. The anisotropy of the medium introduces directional dependencies that modify the standard behavior of the Skyrme solitons, enabling novel control over wave propagation and energy distribution.\n\nNon-Hermitian funneling in anisotropic media is closely tied to the non-Hermitian skin effect, where eigenstates localize at the boundaries under open boundary conditions [2]. In such systems, the interplay between anisotropy and non-Hermitian parameters results in a complex spatial distribution of eigenmodes. This leads to the formation of robust corner states that can guide light or other waveforms through predefined paths, regardless of their initial position. The funneling mechanism is particularly effective in two-dimensional lattices, where the anisotropic structure enhances the directional control of wave propagation, offering new possibilities for reconfigurable photonic and acoustic devices.\n\nThe theoretical analysis of the Skyrme model in non-Hermitian anisotropic media reveals the importance of symmetry breaking and topological protection in stabilizing funneling dynamics. By incorporating non-reciprocal couplings and spatially varying gain-loss profiles, the system exhibits a rich phase diagram with distinct regimes of localization and propagation. These findings not only deepen the understanding of non-Hermitian systems but also open new avenues for engineering robust and controllable waveguiding structures in complex media. The interplay between topological properties and non-Hermitian effects remains a promising area for future research [14].",

By introducing synthetic temporal dimensions through time-multiplexed light pulses in fiber loops, it becomes possible to dynamically manipulate gain and loss at a timescale faster than the light pulse dynamics within the lattice. This enables precise control over the degree of localization of corner states, offering a pathway to engineer and tailor the spatial distribution of light within the system. Such control is essential for realizing applications like adiabatic tweezing, where corner states can be moved along predefined trajectories, and 2D funneling, where light is directed to a specific corner regardless of its initial position [7].\n\nThe interplay between controllable parameters and non-Hermitian localization is further enriched by the ability to introduce and manage disorder, which can either suppress or enhance boundary localization. This dynamic control allows for the exploration of how non-Hermitian effects interact with structural imperfections, leading to a deeper understanding of the robustness and adaptability of localized states. By varying parameters such as gain/loss strength and temporal modulation frequency, researchers can probe the transition between trivial boundary modes and non-trivial non-Hermitian skin modes [2]. This distinction is crucial for applications requiring stable and predictable light confinement, such as in enhanced sensing or topological energy transfer.\n\nMoreover, the study of controllable parameters in non-Hermitian photonic systems has significant implications for quantum information processing and topological photonics. The ability to manipulate localization through synthetic dimensions opens new avenues for designing reconfigurable photonic circuits with tailored properties. These systems offer a unique platform to investigate the interplay between non-Hermitian physics and quantum coherence, paving the way for novel photonic devices with enhanced functionality and performance [8]. The insights gained from such studies contribute to the broader understanding of non-Hermitian systems and their potential for future technological applications [1].",

Unlike conventional Hermitian systems, where eigenstates are typically extended or localized due to disorder, non-Hermitian systems exhibit a macroscopic fraction of eigenmodes that accumulate at the boundaries [9]. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in systems with open boundary conditions, where the interplay of non-Hermitian parameters results in a breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence [5]. The quantization of decay charges arises from the discrete nature of the gain and loss distribution, which governs the exponential or algebraic decay of the eigenmodes. This behavior is fundamentally different from the exponential localization seen in Hermitian systems and highlights the unique topological features of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.\n\nAlgebraic skin effects represent a distinct class of non-Hermitian localization, where the decay of eigenstates follows a power-law rather than an exponential profile [13]. This behavior is observed in systems with specific boundary configurations and spatial symmetries, where the non-Hermitian parameters induce a long-range correlation in the eigenstate distribution. The algebraic nature of the skin effect is closely tied to the topological properties of the system, particularly in higher-dimensional or curved geometries. These effects are not only theoretically intriguing but also have practical implications for the design of photonic and electronic devices, where controlled localization of energy can enhance performance.

Time-periodic driving introduces a dynamic component that can modify the topological invariants of the system, leading to transitions between distinct topological phases [11]. The presence of EPs, which are points where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, plays a central role in these transitions, as their creation or destruction can fundamentally alter the system's topological structure.\n\nRecent investigations have shown that the stability of topological phases in multiband systems with EPs is governed by the topology of the underlying parameter space and the nature of the EPs themselves [16]. In such systems, the interplay between the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and the periodic driving leads to the emergence of complex energy loops, where the energy spectrum exhibits non-trivial winding and real-valued segments. These loops are crucial for defining the topological invariants, which can change under the influence of time-periodic perturbations.

This complexity arises due to the lack of symmetry in the Hamiltonian, leading to asymmetric energy flow and non-unitary dynamics. The emergence of complex eigenvalues is often associated with the breakdown of parity-time (PT) symmetry, which, when preserved, ensures real energy spectra. However, even when PT symmetry is broken, certain symmetries such as pseudo-Hermiticity can still lead to real or complex-conjugate pairs of eigenvalues, offering a more general framework for understanding non-Hermitian dynamics.\n\nThe study of non-Hermitian dynamics has revealed a rich interplay between complex energy spectra and topological properties [4]. Non-Hermitian systems can exhibit unique topological phases that are not accessible in Hermitian systems, characterized by complex energy band structures and unconventional boundary modes [3]. These topological features are often captured through invariants such as complex Berry phases, winding numbers, and homotopy classifications, which account for the non-trivial topology of complex energy bands [16]. Additionally, the presence of non-Hermitian skin effects further complicates the bulk-boundary correspondence, as the bulk states become localized at the boundaries, leading to a dramatic redistribution of the energy spectrum [4].

In systems with circularly polarized eigenmodes, the localization direction—left or right—depends on the polarization state of the incident wave, enabling polarization-based control over edge localization without altering the medium [9]. This behavior is distinct from systems with linearly polarized eigenmodes, where each mode consistently localizes at a single edge [9]. The interplay between polarization, boundary conditions, and the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) plays a crucial role in determining the spatial distribution of eigenstates [17]. Computational verification of such localization relies on analyzing the complex energy spectrum and identifying the winding direction of eigenvalues, which directly correlates with the localization pattern.\n\nComputational methods for verifying boundary-driven localization typically involve solving the eigenvalue problem under open boundary conditions (OBC) and comparing the results with those obtained under periodic boundary conditions (PBC). The generalized Szegö’s limit theorem provides a framework for predicting the correct localization length by optimizing the Ronkin function derived from the PBC spectrum [13]. This approach is particularly effective for single-band systems in arbitrary dimensions, where the inverse localization length emerges as the solution to the optimization problem. For multi-band systems, symmetry-based decompositions and advanced numerical techniques are employed to capture the intricate interplay between topological invariants and boundary effects. These methods enable the accurate prediction of edge states and the verification of non-Bloch topological invariants, which are essential for characterizing non-Hermitian systems [11].\n\nThe computational verification of boundary-driven localization also involves analyzing the impact of disorder, nonlinearity, and synthetic gauge fields on the localization behavior. For instance, in systems with flat bands, destructive interference among different propagation paths can lead to bulk mode localization, offering an alternative mechanism for boundary-driven effects [17]. Additionally, the presence of a closed imaginary gap can significantly alter the loss probability distribution, causing a peak at the boundary [14]. These findings highlight the robustness of boundary-driven localization against perturbations and the importance of considering both topological and non-Hermitian effects in the design of novel photonic and electronic devices.

This results in the emergence of novel localization phenomena, where the spatial distribution of eigenstates is not only determined by the system's topology and boundary conditions but also by the intensity profile of the excitation. The intensity-dependent couplings can induce a reconfiguration of the generalized Brillouin zone and alter the energy spectrum, thereby modifying the localization behavior of bulk states.

This phenomenon is fundamentally tied to the topological structure of the lattice and the presence of magnetic flux, which introduces phase factors that govern the interference between different hopping paths. The flat-band nature of AB caging makes it highly sensitive to external perturbations, particularly disorder, which can disrupt the delicate balance of interference and lead to significant modifications in the system's transport and localization properties. This sensitivity sets the stage for studying how disorder influences the stability and emergence of such topologically protected states.\n\nDisorder-induced effects in AB-caged systems have been extensively studied, revealing a rich interplay between localization and delocalization. In particular, Bernoulli antisymmetric disorder has been shown to induce an inverse Anderson transition, where the system transitions from an insulating to a metallic phase [17]. This transition is a direct consequence of the disorder breaking the symmetry that sustains the AB caging, thereby altering the flat-band structure and allowing for the delocalization of previously localized states. Additionally, the introduction of correlated disorders, such as random anti-symmetric and Bernoulli anti-symmetric types, further modulates the system's behavior, leading to complex patterns of localization and transport.

This suggests that the robustness of AB caging against disorder may be compromised in non-Hermitian settings, leading to new forms of localization and transport.

      "content": "Nonreciprocal hopping, characterized by asymmetric inter-cell couplings, plays a central role in the emergence of non-Hermitian topological phases. In one-dimensional systems, such as the Hatano-Nelson model, nonreciprocal hopping leads to the non-Hermitian skin effect, where eigenstates localize at system boundaries rather than being distributed uniformly [9]. This phenomenon fundamentally challenges the conventional Bloch band theory, necessitating the development of non-Bloch band theory [13]. By introducing a generalized Brillouin zone, this theory accounts for the boundary-localized states and provides a framework to understand the topological properties of non-Hermitian systems [11]. The interplay between nonreciprocal hopping and topological invariants reveals new mechanisms for phase transitions, where the bulk-boundary correspondence is redefined.\n\nIn two-dimensional systems, nonreciprocal hopping can give rise to graphene-like semimetal phases with flat bands and Möbius topological insulators with twisted edge states [3]. These phases have been realized in various platforms, including acoustic crystals, photonic lattices, and electric circuits. The introduction of nonreciprocal couplings in such systems enables the engineering of novel band structures, where the interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity leads to unique transport properties. The presence of flat bands in graphene-like phases can enhance interactions and support exotic quantum states, while the Möbius topology introduces nontrivial boundary effects. These findings highlight the potential of nonreciprocal hopping for designing advanced topological devices with enhanced functionalities [3].\n\nThe experimental realization of nonreciprocal hopping in electrical circuits and photonic systems demonstrates the feasibility of creating controllable non-Hermitian topological phases [3]. By leveraging the boundary sensitivity of non-Hermitian systems, such as the skin effect, it becomes possible to design devices with high sensitivity and robustness against disorder [18]. The ability to tune nonreciprocal couplings allows for the exploration of phase transitions and the emergence of novel topological states. These developments open new avenues for applications in sensing, wave manipulation, and quantum information processing, underscoring the significance of nonreciprocal hopping in shaping the future of topological materials.",

      "content": "The transfer matrix method provides a powerful framework for analyzing wave propagation in periodic media, particularly in the context of non-Hermitian systems. By constructing a transfer matrix that encapsulates the scattering properties of a unit cell, one can derive the eigenvalues that govern the system's behavior under periodic boundary conditions. These eigenvalues are directly linked to the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ), which replaces the conventional Brillouin zone in non-Bloch band theory [11]. The GBZ is determined by the condition that the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix must satisfy a specific relationship, reflecting the complex nature of the Bloch wave number in non-Hermitian systems. This approach enables the characterization of bulk states and their localization properties, which are critical for understanding the non-Hermitian skin effect [4].\n\nThe condition for the generalized Brillouin zone arises from the requirement that the determinant of the transfer matrix remains unity, ensuring the conservation of wave intensity in the absence of dissipation [12]. However, in non-Hermitian systems, this condition is modified due to the presence of complex eigenvalues and the associated non-unitary evolution. The GBZ is thus defined as the set of complex wave numbers for which the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix satisfy a specific winding condition, leading to the emergence of extended or localized states. This definition allows for a more accurate description of the band structure, particularly in systems where the conventional Bloch theory fails due to the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence [13].\n\nBy analyzing the transfer matrix and its eigenvalues, one can determine the shape and topology of the generalized Brillouin zone, which in turn governs the distribution of eigenstates in the system. This analysis reveals how the GBZ can be deformed or distorted under the influence of non-Hermitian terms, such as gain or loss, leading to the emergence of novel topological phases. The interplay between the transfer matrix formalism and the GBZ provides a robust theoretical foundation for studying non-Hermitian systems, enabling the prediction and characterization of edge states, bulk localization, and other critical phenomena. This approach is essential for advancing the understanding of non-Bloch band theory and its applications in photonic and electronic systems [13].",

      "content": "**Future Work**\n\nDespite significant progress in understanding non-Hermitian systems, several limitations and gaps remain in the current research landscape. One major limitation is the incomplete characterization of non-Hermitian systems under realistic conditions, such as the influence of disorder, nonlinearity, and finite-size effects. While theoretical frameworks like non-Bloch band theory have advanced our understanding, their applicability to complex, multi-dimensional, and interacting systems is still limited. Additionally, the role of higher-order topological invariants in non-Hermitian systems remains poorly understood, particularly in systems with non-trivial geometric structures or synthetic dimensions. Another critical gap is the lack of a unified theoretical framework that can consistently describe the interplay between non-Hermitian effects, topological invariants, and boundary conditions across different physical platforms. These limitations hinder the development of robust, scalable, and experimentally verifiable models for non-Hermitian systems.\n\nTo address these challenges, future research should focus on developing more comprehensive theoretical models that incorporate the effects of disorder, nonlinearity, and finite-size scaling. This includes refining non-Bloch band theory to handle multi-band and higher-dimensional systems, as well as exploring the role of higher-order topological invariants in non-Her",
