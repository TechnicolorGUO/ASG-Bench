Similarly, in terrestrial environments, such models can track the spread of invasive species or the degradation of habitats. By capturing the interplay between spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics, these models provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating the cumulative impacts of environmental stressors on ecosystems [3].\n\nMoreover, spatiotemporal modeling facilitates the development of predictive tools that support decision-making in environmental management and policy. These models can simulate various scenarios to assess the potential outcomes of different interventions, such as habitat restoration or pollution control measures. They also enable the identification of critical thresholds beyond which ecosystems may experience irreversible changes.

By leveraging the strengths of convolutional networks and regularization strategies, these methods provide robust solutions for imputing missing values and uncovering hidden trends in environmental time series [11].\n\nDespite these advances, challenges remain in developing models that can generalize across diverse environmental conditions and extreme events. The lack of high-quality, balanced datasets—particularly for rare or extreme anomalies—limits the effectiveness of many existing approaches. Furthermore, the dynamic and often noisy nature of environmental data requires models that are both accurate and computationally efficient.

Traditional methods often struggle with imbalanced datasets, where rare events are underrepresented, leading to poor model generalization. Gaussian Copulas, a probabilistic technique, offer a promising alternative by preserving complex interdependencies within data while generating synthetic samples that reflect the underlying statistical structure [12]. This method enables the creation of diverse and representative datasets, which can enhance the training of machine learning models for tasks such as algal bloom risk prediction and microplastic detection [12]. By generating data that fills gaps in underrepresented regions, Gaussian Copulas provide a viable solution to the limitations of real-world data [12].\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of synthetic data generation depends heavily on the quality and representativeness of the generated samples. While Gaussian Copulas are capable of capturing multivariate dependencies, they may still suffer from overfitting if not properly tuned, especially when dealing with high-dimensional and nonlinear data. This limitation highlights the need for careful validation and integration of synthetic data with real-world observations. Furthermore, the application of synthetic data in rare event prediction requires robust evaluation metrics to ensure that the generated samples contribute meaningfully to model performance. Techniques such as data augmentation and feature fusion can complement synthetic data generation, improving the model's ability to generalize across diverse scenarios and enhancing its predictive accuracy.\n\nThe integration of synthetic data into machine learning pipelines for rare event prediction is an evolving area of research, with ongoing efforts to refine generation techniques and improve model robustness. While methods like SMOTE and GANs have shown promise in addressing class imbalance, the use of probabilistic models such as Gaussian Copulas provides a more principled approach to data synthesis. Future work should focus on developing hybrid strategies that combine the strengths of different synthetic data generation methods, while also addressing the challenges of high-dimensional, temporally dependent data.
