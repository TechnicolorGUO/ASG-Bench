This approach is particularly promising for synthesizing unfamiliar molecules, where the reaction pathways are not well characterized. By framing the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), RL can explore multiple reaction centers and their interdependencies, providing a more flexible and adaptive solution compared to prior methods that assume a single reaction center or lack explicit handling of multi-center scenarios [9].\n\nRecent advancements in RL for reaction path optimization have focused on integrating domain-specific knowledge with deep learning architectures to improve sample efficiency and generalization. These methods often employ graph-based representations of molecules and reaction templates to encode chemical constraints and guide the agent's exploration. However, challenges remain in accurately modeling the reward landscape, which is typically sparse and noisy due to the complexity of chemical transformations. Additionally, the computational cost of evaluating reaction outcomes, such as through quantum chemistry calculations, can hinder the scalability of RL approaches. To address these issues, researchers have explored hybrid strategies that combine RL with surrogate models or physics-based simulations, aiming to balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining computational feasibility.\n\nDespite these developments, the application of RL to reaction path optimization is still in its early stages, with many open questions regarding the generalizability of learned policies across different chemical systems and the integration of multi-objective optimization criteria. Future work will need to address the limitations of current formulations, particularly in handling multi-reaction center scenarios and incorporating real-time feedback from experimental or computational validation. By refining the MDP formulation and leveraging advances in representation learning, RL has the potential to revolutionize the discovery of novel synthetic routes, enabling more efficient and sustainable chemical synthesis.",
