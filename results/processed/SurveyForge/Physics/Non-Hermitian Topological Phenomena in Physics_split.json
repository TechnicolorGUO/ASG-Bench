Unlike their Hermitian counterparts, non-Hermitian systems do not obey the constraint of self-adjointness, allowing for complex eigenvalues and non-orthogonal eigenstates, which fundamentally alter the nature of topological invariants and the robustness of quantum states [1]. This departure from the standard Hermitian framework has opened new avenues for exploring topological phases in systems where gain, loss, or dissipation play a pivotal role. The study of such systems is not only theoretically intriguing but also increasingly relevant for practical applications in condensed matter, photonics, and quantum information science [1]. The significance of non-Hermitian topological phenomena lies in their ability to model real-world systems more accurately, where interactions with external environments and the presence of non-unitary dynamics are inevitable [1].\n\nHistorically, the investigation of non-Hermitian systems began with the work of Bender and Boettcher on PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, which demonstrated that certain non-Hermitian Hamiltonians could still exhibit real eigenvalues under specific symmetry conditions [1]. This sparked renewed interest in the interplay between non-Hermitian effects and topological properties, leading to the development of generalized topological invariants such as the non-Hermitian Chern number and winding numbers [1]. These invariants provide a robust framework for classifying non-Hermitian topological phases, even in the presence of non-orthogonal eigenstates and complex spectra. However, the characterization of such systems remains a non-trivial task, as the standard tools of Hermitian topology—such as the Berry phase and Chern number—require modification to account for the unique features of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians [2].\n\nThe interdisciplinary impact of non-Hermitian topological phenomena is profound, influencing fields as diverse as quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, and engineering. In condensed matter, non-Hermitian effects can induce novel topological phases, such as non-Hermitian skin effects and exceptional point-driven phase transitions, which challenge the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence [3]. In photonics, non-Hermitian topology has enabled the design of robust waveguides and topological lasers, leveraging the unique properties of exceptional points to achieve single-mode lasing and enhanced sensitivity [1]. In quantum information, the interplay between non-Hermitian dynamics and topological protection has opened new possibilities for fault-tolerant quantum computing and quantum sensing [3]. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of machine learning and topological data analysis offers promising tools for the discovery and characterization of non-Hermitian topological phases, as demonstrated in recent studies that employ neural networks to predict topological invariants with high accuracy [4].\n\nThe study of non-Hermitian topological phenomena is not without its challenges. The non-unitary nature of these systems introduces new complexities in the analysis of stability, robustness, and phase transitions. Moreover, the absence of a well-defined inner product in non-Hermitian systems complicates the definition of topological invariants and the development of efficient numerical methods for their computation. Despite these challenges, the growing body of theoretical and experimental work suggests that non-Hermitian topological phenomena will continue to shape the future of modern physics, offering new insights into the fundamental principles that govern complex, open systems. As such, a comprehensive and rigorous exploration of these phenomena is essential for advancing both theoretical understanding and practical applications in the years to come.",

Unlike their Hermitian counterparts, which are guaranteed to have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can possess complex eigenvalues and non-orthogonal eigenvectors, leading to fundamentally different dynamical behaviors [1]. This deviation from the standard quantum mechanical framework is not merely a mathematical curiosity; it has profound implications for the spectral and topological properties of physical systems, especially in the presence of gain and loss mechanisms. The study of these systems is particularly relevant in the context of non-Hermitian topology, where spectral properties play a central role in defining robust topological phases [1].\n\nThe spectral properties of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are characterized by complex eigenvalues, which can be interpreted as a manifestation of gain and loss in open systems [1]. These complex eigenvalues are not just a byproduct of non-Hermiticity; they are intrinsic to the system’s dynamics and can lead to phenomena such as exceptional points (EPs), where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, giving rise to non-trivial topological structures [1]. Furthermore, the non-orthogonality of eigenvectors in non-Hermitian systems leads to a failure of the spectral theorem, a key feature of Hermitian systems. This non-orthogonality complicates the analysis of spectral decomposition and necessitates new mathematical tools to describe the dynamics of such systems [1].\n\nThe comparison between the spectral properties of Hermitian and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians reveals both challenges and opportunities. While Hermitian systems benefit from the well-established properties of real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors, non-Hermitian systems offer a richer structure, with complex eigenvalues enabling the study of non-unitary dynamics, dissipation, and phase transitions. This complexity, however, requires the development of generalized topological invariants to capture the unique features of non-Hermitian systems [2]. For example, the non-Hermitian Chern number and biorthogonal Chern number have been introduced to extend the concept of topological invariants to non-Hermitian settings, providing a way to classify and understand topological phases in these systems [3].\n\nThe emergence of non-Hermitian spectral properties also raises important questions about the stability and robustness of topological states. While Hermitian systems exhibit robustness due to the protection of topological invariants, non-Hermitian systems show a more nuanced behavior, where the interplay between spectral properties and topological structures can lead to new types of phase transitions and edge modes [1]. This calls for a deeper understanding of how non-Hermitian effects influence topological robustness, particularly in the presence of EPs and other singularities.\n\nIn summary, the study of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and their spectral properties is a rapidly evolving field that bridges mathematical formalism with physical insight. The unique features of complex eigenvalues and non-orthogonal eigenvectors open up new avenues for exploring the interplay between topology, dynamics, and symmetry in non-Hermitian systems. As research progresses, it is expected that these spectral properties will continue to inspire innovative approaches to understanding and controlling non-Hermitian topological phenomena.",

      "content": "The extension of topological invariants from Hermitian to non-Hermitian systems represents a significant advancement in the mathematical foundation of non-Hermitian topology. Unlike their Hermitian counterparts, where the spectral theorem guarantees orthogonal eigenstates and real eigenvalues, non-Hermitian systems exhibit complex eigenvalues and non-orthogonal eigenstates, fundamentally altering the nature of topological classification. This necessitates the development of generalized invariants that account for the unique properties of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Among these, the non-Hermitian Chern number, winding numbers, and biorthogonal Chern numbers stand out as essential tools for characterizing topological phases in non-Hermitian settings [1; 1].\n\nThe non-Hermitian Chern number extends the traditional Chern number to non-Hermitian systems by incorporating the biorthogonal nature of eigenstates. In Hermitian systems, the Chern number is defined using the Berry curvature, which arises from the projection of the system's Hilbert space onto the Bloch states. However, in non-Hermitian systems, the non-orthogonality of eigenstates necessitates a redefinition of the Berry curvature using biorthogonal eigenvectors. This leads to a Chern number that captures the topological structure of the system even in the presence of complex eigenvalues [1]. The biorthogonal Chern number, in particular, has been shown to be a robust invariant that remains well-defined even when the system exhibits exceptional points, where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce [1].\n\nWinding numbers provide another crucial class of topological invariants in non-Hermitian systems. These numbers are typically defined in one- and two-dimensional systems and capture the winding of the Hamiltonian's spectrum as a function of momentum. In Hermitian systems, the winding number is related to the chiral symmetry of the system. In non-Hermitian systems, the winding number can be generalized by considering the complex spectrum and its behavior under periodic boundary conditions. For example, in one-dimensional systems with non-Hermitian perturbations, the winding number can distinguish between different topological phases characterized by the presence or absence of edge modes [1; 2].\n\nThe emergence of non-Hermitian topological invariants has also sparked interest in the role of symmetry in non-Hermitian systems. Unlike Hermitian systems, where symmetries such as time-reversal and particle-hole symmetry play a central role, non-Hermitian systems exhibit a broader class of symmetries, including PT symmetry and chiral symmetry. These symmetries can protect topological phases and influence the behavior of topological invariants. For instance, PT-symmetric systems can support topologically protected edge modes even in the presence of gain and loss [3]. The interplay between symmetry and topology in non-Hermitian systems is an active area of research, with implications for the design of robust topological devices.\n\nDespite significant progress, several challenges remain in the development and application of non-Hermitian topological invariants. One major issue is the computational complexity of calculating these invariants, particularly for large-scale systems. Efficient numerical algorithms, such as those based on the FEAST eigensolver [1], are essential for handling the non-Hermitian spectral properties. Additionally, the relationship between non-Hermitian invariants and the physical observables, such as edge modes and exceptional points, requires further investigation.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of generalized topological invariants in non-Hermitian systems has opened new avenues for understanding the topological structure of open and dissipative quantum systems. The extension of the Chern number, winding numbers, and biorthogonal Chern numbers provides a powerful framework for characterizing non-Hermitian topological phases. Future work should focus on improving the computational efficiency of these invariants and exploring their applications in quantum technologies and condensed matter systems.",

      "content": "Exceptional points (EPs) are singularities in the spectrum of non-Hermitian systems where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, marking a fundamental departure from the behavior of Hermitian systems. These points arise when the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian ceases to be diagonalizable, leading to a breakdown of the spectral theorem and a dramatic restructuring of the system's dynamics. EPs are not merely mathematical curiosities; they are central to the understanding of non-Hermitian topology, as they can drive topological phase transitions and give rise to novel topological structures that are absent in their Hermitian counterparts [5]. The presence of EPs can lead to non-trivial topological invariants, which are robust against perturbations, and they often serve as critical points in the phase diagram of non-Hermitian systems.\n\nThe role of EPs in topological phase transitions is particularly profound. In conventional Hermitian systems, phase transitions are typically characterized by the closing and reopening of the energy gap, or by the change in topological invariants. In non-Hermitian systems, however, the presence of EPs can lead to more complex transitions, where the system's topological properties are altered not only by the closing of the gap but also by the merging of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This leads to the emergence of new topological phases that are stabilized by the presence of EPs, which can act as sources or sinks of topological charge [6]. Such transitions are often accompanied by the formation of non-trivial topological structures, such as non-Hermitian skin effects or the emergence of non-adiabatic dynamics near EPs.\n\nMoreover, EPs play a crucial role in the robustness of topological states in non-Hermitian systems. Unlike in Hermitian systems, where topological protection is often tied to the presence of symmetries such as time-reversal or particle-hole symmetry, non-Hermitian systems can exhibit topological robustness even in the absence of such symmetries, provided that EPs are present. This is because the coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors at EPs can lead to a reorganization of the system's topology, resulting in the emergence of new topological invariants that are insensitive to certain types of perturbations [7]. Furthermore, EPs can be used as a tool to engineer topological states, enabling the design of systems with tailored topological properties [8].\n\nThe study of EPs in non-Hermitian systems is an active area of research, with significant implications for both theoretical and applied physics. From the perspective of fundamental physics, EPs offer a new paradigm for understanding topological phase transitions and the emergence of non-trivial topological structures. From an applied perspective, EPs have potential applications in the design of robust topological devices, such as topological lasers, sensors, and photonic circuits, where their unique properties can be exploited to achieve enhanced performance and stability [9]. As the field continues to evolve, a deeper understanding of the interplay between EPs and topology will be essential for unlocking the full potential of non-Hermitian systems.",

Unlike Hermitian systems, where symmetries such as time-reversal, particle-hole, and chiral symmetries play a central role in defining topological classes, non-Hermitian systems exhibit a more complex symmetry landscape, including non-Hermitian counterparts like $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and generalized antiunitary symmetries. These symmetries not only influence the stability of topological states but also dictate the nature of spectral singularities such as exceptional points (EPs) and the emergence of novel topological invariants [1; 1].\n\nThe role of algebraic structures in non-Hermitian systems is equally profound. While Hermitian Hamiltonians are often analyzed using the framework of Lie algebras and unitary transformations, non-Hermitian systems demand more generalized algebraic tools. For example, the use of biorthogonal eigenstates and non-Hermitian Chern numbers highlights the need for extended mathematical formalisms beyond the standard Hermitian framework [10; 1]. Lie algebras, particularly those associated with non-Hermitian operators, provide a robust framework for studying the algebraic properties of non-Hermitian systems, while Clifford algebras offer insights into the geometric and topological features of such systems [11; 12].\n\nThe classification of non-Hermitian topological phases is further complicated by the existence of non-Hermitian symmetry classes, which extend the tenfold way of Hermitian topology. These classes, such as the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and chiral-symmetric classes, introduce distinct topological invariants and phase diagrams that reflect the unique properties of non-Hermitian systems [1; 13]. The interplay between non-Hermitian symmetries and topological invariants is especially critical in the study of systems with EPs, where the coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors leads to non-trivial topological structures and phase transitions [4; 3].\n\nFurthermore, the algebraic properties of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, such as their non-unitary evolution and complex eigenvalues, necessitate new approaches to defining and computing topological invariants. The biorthogonal Chern number, for instance, provides a way to capture the topological properties of non-Hermitian systems with non-orthogonal eigenstates, offering a generalization of the conventional Chern number [10; 1]. These developments underscore the need for a unified mathematical framework that can seamlessly integrate the concepts of symmetry, algebra, and topology in non-Hermitian systems.\n\nLooking forward, the study of symmetry and algebraic structures in non-Hermitian systems is poised to uncover novel topological phenomena and enable the design of robust quantum and classical devices. Emerging trends, such as the use of machine learning to predict and classify non-Hermitian topological invariants, highlight the potential for interdisciplinary advancements [1; 1].

While conventional symmetry classes such as time-reversal, particle-hole, and chiral symmetries play a foundational role in the tenfold way of Hermitian topological insulators, their non-Hermitian counterparts require a generalized classification due to the absence of a complete spectral theorem and the presence of complex eigenvalues. This subsection explores how non-Hermitian symmetries, including parity-time (PT) symmetry, chiral symmetry, and other extended symmetry classes, shape the topological structure of non-Hermitian systems and enable the identification of distinct topological phases.\n\nPT symmetry, a cornerstone of non-Hermitian systems, introduces a novel form of symmetry where the Hamiltonian is invariant under the combined operations of parity (spatial inversion) and time-reversal. Unlike its Hermitian counterparts, PT symmetry can be spontaneously broken, leading to phase transitions between real and complex spectra. This property has been instrumental in the classification of non-Hermitian topological phases, as PT-symmetric systems can exhibit robust edge states even in the absence of Hermitian symmetry protection [1]. However, the classification of PT-symmetric systems is nontrivial due to the presence of exceptional points, where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, and the failure of conventional topological invariants such as the Chern number to capture the full topological structure [1].\n\nChiral symmetry, another key player in non-Hermitian topology, is defined by the anticommutation of the Hamiltonian with a chiral operator. In Hermitian systems, chiral symmetry protects topological phases by enforcing a zero net Chern number, but in non-Hermitian systems, the interplay between chiral symmetry and non-Hermitian perturbations leads to the emergence of new invariants. The non-Hermitian generalization of chiral symmetry has enabled the identification of topological phases in systems where conventional invariants fail, such as in the SSH model with non-Hermitian hopping [1]. These systems exhibit a rich phase diagram, with topological transitions driven by symmetry-breaking perturbations and exceptional points.\n\nThe broader framework of non-Hermitian symmetry classes extends beyond PT and chiral symmetries to include other generalized symmetries, such as those arising from the interplay of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with spatial and temporal modulations. This has led to the development of a non-Hermitian extension of the tenfold way, which incorporates symmetries beyond the conventional Hermitian classification [1]. Such a framework allows for the systematic classification of non-Hermitian topological phases based on their response to symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking perturbations, as well as their robustness against non-Hermitian effects.\n\nIn summary, the symmetry-based classification of non-Hermitian topological phases represents a vibrant and rapidly evolving area of research, with profound implications for both fundamental physics and practical applications. The integration of non-Hermitian symmetries into the topological classification scheme not only enriches our understanding of non-Hermitian systems but also opens new avenues for the design of robust topological devices and materials. Future directions in this field include the exploration of higher-dimensional systems, the role of non-Hermitian symmetries in strongly correlated systems, and the interplay between topology and non-Hermitian effects in quantum many-body systems.",

Unlike their Hermitian counterparts, where topological invariants such as the Chern number or Z2 invariant are defined through the Berry curvature or the Pfaffian of the Hamiltonian, non-Hermitian systems require a broader framework due to the complex spectra and non-orthogonal eigenstates that arise from the lack of Hermiticity. These challenges have led to the emergence of new invariants that extend the traditional notions of topology to non-Hermitian settings, such as the non-Hermitian Chern number [1], biorthogonal Chern numbers [1], and generalized winding numbers [1]. These invariants are not only essential for characterizing the topological phases of non-Hermitian systems but also for establishing the non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence, which links the topology of the bulk to the existence of robust edge states.\n\nA central challenge in defining topological invariants for non-Hermitian systems is the failure of the spectral theorem, which results in non-orthogonal eigenstates and the absence of a well-defined inner product. This has motivated the use of biorthogonal eigenstates, where left and right eigenvectors are not identical, leading to the development of biorthogonal invariants such as the biorthogonal Chern number [1]. These invariants are constructed by projecting the Berry connection onto the biorthogonal basis, thereby enabling the characterization of topological properties even when the Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian. Additionally, winding numbers have been generalized to non-Hermitian systems by considering the behavior of eigenvalues under periodic boundary conditions in the complex plane [1]. These winding numbers provide a powerful tool for classifying one- and two-dimensional non-Hermitian topological systems, especially in the presence of exceptional points, which are singularities where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce [1].\n\nThe non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence is another critical aspect that has been extensively studied in recent years. While the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence in Hermitian systems establishes a direct relationship between the bulk topology and the existence of edge states, the non-Hermitian case presents additional complexity due to the presence of non-Hermitian skin effects, where bulk states localize at the boundaries [1]. This has led to the development of generalized bulk-boundary correspondence principles that incorporate the non-Hermitian nature of the system [1]. These principles have been validated through both theoretical models and experimental realizations in photonic and electronic systems, demonstrating the robustness of topological states in non-Hermitian settings.\n\nRecent advances in the field have also highlighted the importance of symmetry in shaping the topological invariants of non-Hermitian systems. For instance, the interplay between non-Hermitian symmetries such as PT symmetry and the topological invariants has been shown to stabilize topological phases and lead to novel phase transitions [1]. The study of these invariants not only deepens our understanding of topological phases in open and dissipative systems but also opens new avenues for the design of robust quantum devices and topological photonic structures. As the field continues to evolve, further exploration of the role of non-Hermitian invariants in higher dimensions and in the presence of strong interactions remains a promising direction for future research.",

These singularities play a pivotal role in the emergence of topological transitions and the formation of non-trivial topological states, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between symmetry, topology, and non-Hermitian dynamics. Unlike Hermitian systems, where topological phases are typically protected by symmetry, non-Hermitian systems can exhibit topological transitions driven by EPs, where the system's global topology changes as the parameters are varied through these critical points [1]. This phenomenon has been extensively studied in the context of both one-dimensional and two-dimensional models, where EPs have been shown to serve as the critical points for phase transitions, often associated with the closing and reopening of spectral gaps [1].\n\nThe role of EPs in topological transitions is closely tied to their unique spectral and geometric properties. At an EP, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system become degenerate, leading to a non-trivial Jordan block structure in the Hamiltonian. This degeneracy allows for the emergence of non-trivial topological invariants, such as the non-Hermitian Chern number or the winding number, which can change discontinuously as the system passes through an EP [1]. The coalescence of eigenstates at an EP also leads to the formation of non-orthogonal eigenstates, which can significantly influence the system's response to perturbations and its overall stability. These effects are particularly pronounced in systems with PT symmetry, where the interplay between gain and loss can lead to the formation of robust topological edge states that are protected by the presence of EPs [1].\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, the control and manipulation of EPs offer new opportunities for designing and engineering topological phases in non-Hermitian systems. Recent experimental realizations in photonic and electronic systems have demonstrated the feasibility of creating and detecting EPs, paving the way for novel applications in quantum information processing, sensing, and wave manipulation [1]. Theoretical studies have also explored the use of EPs as a mechanism for symmetry breaking, where the system's topology can be tuned by adjusting the location and order of EPs in the parameter space [2].\n\nDespite the progress made, several challenges remain in the characterization and control of EPs in non-Hermitian systems. The non-trivial spectral properties of EPs make them difficult to detect and analyze using conventional topological invariants, necessitating the development of new mathematical and computational techniques [3]. Moreover, the robustness of topological states near EPs is still an active area of research, as the interplay between EPs and disorder can significantly affect the system's stability and performance [1]. Future directions in this field include the exploration of higher-order EPs and their role in more complex topological transitions, as well as the integration of machine learning techniques for the automated detection and analysis of EPs in large-scale systems [3]. These efforts will be crucial in advancing the understanding and application of non-Hermitian topological phases in both theoretical and experimental settings.",

      "content": "The non-Hermitian skin effect is a striking phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems, where bulk states localize at the boundaries instead of being distributed throughout the system. This behavior fundamentally differs from the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence observed in Hermitian systems, where topological edge states emerge from the interplay between the bulk topology and the system's boundary conditions. In non-Hermitian systems, the skin effect can dominate the spectral properties, leading to a breakdown of the standard topological bulk-boundary correspondence [14]. The localization of states at the edges is driven by the non-Hermitian nature of the system, particularly the presence of gain and loss, which can induce asymmetric propagation and non-reciprocal couplings. This effect has been observed in a wide range of systems, including photonic lattices, electronic circuits, and mechanical metamaterials, highlighting its universality across different physical platforms [15].\n\nThe implications of the non-Hermitian skin effect for topological robustness are profound. In Hermitian systems, topological protection arises from the stability of the bulk topology under small perturbations. However, in non-Hermitian systems, the skin effect introduces a new layer of complexity. While the edge-localized states can be robust against certain types of perturbations, their stability is often sensitive to the specific form of non-Hermitian parameters, such as the gain-loss balance and the spatial distribution of non-Hermitian couplings [1]. This sensitivity raises important questions about the robustness of topological states in non-Hermitian systems and the conditions under which they can maintain their topological character.\n\nA key challenge in characterizing the non-Hermitian skin effect is the development of appropriate topological invariants that account for the localization of bulk states. Traditional invariants such as the Chern number or winding number, which are defined for Hermitian systems, may fail to capture the topological properties of non-Hermitian systems due to the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence. Recent advances have introduced generalized invariants, such as the biorthogonal Chern number and the non-Hermitian winding number, which are better suited for capturing the topological properties of non-Hermitian systems with skin effects [2]. These invariants provide a framework for classifying non-Hermitian topological phases and understanding how the skin effect modifies the topological structure of the system.\n\nThe non-Hermitian skin effect is closely connected to the broader context of non-Hermitian topological phases and their characterization. As discussed in the previous subsection, the role of exceptional points in topological transitions highlights the interplay between non-Hermitian singularities and topological properties. Similarly, the skin effect further influences the topological phase diagram, often leading to new types of phase transitions and topological states. The interplay between the skin effect and other topological features, such as exceptional points and chiral symmetries, remains a central topic in current research, emphasizing the complex and rich structure of non-Hermitian topological systems [1].\n\nDespite these advances, several open questions remain. One critical issue is the interplay between the skin effect and other topological features, such as exceptional points and chiral symmetries. The presence of the skin effect can modify the topological phase diagram of a system, leading to new types of phase transitions and topological states. Understanding these interactions is essential for the design of robust non-Hermitian topological devices and the development of novel quantum technologies. As the field continues to evolve, the study of the non-Hermitian skin effect will play a central role in shaping the future of non-Hermitian topological phenomena.",

Unlike Hermitian Hamiltonians, which preserve the norm of quantum states and ensure real eigenvalues, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can lead to exponential growth or decay, reflecting the presence of gain and loss in open systems [1]. This deviation from unitarity results in a breakdown of the standard conservation laws, necessitating a reevaluation of the underlying principles of time evolution in non-Hermitian settings.\n\nThe spectral properties of non-Hermitian systems are characterized by complex eigenvalues, which arise from the coupling of the system to its environment. These eigenvalues can be either real or complex, depending on the system's symmetry and the nature of the perturbations. When complex eigenvalues emerge, they can lead to non-adiabatic effects, where the system's state undergoes rapid transitions that are not captured by traditional adiabatic approximations [1]. This phenomenon is particularly relevant in systems with exceptional points, where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, leading to singularities that profoundly influence the system's dynamics [1].\n\nNon-orthogonal eigenstates, another hallmark of non-Hermitian systems, further complicate the dynamics by violating the spectral theorem that underpins Hermitian quantum mechanics. These eigenstates are not only non-orthogonal but also do not form a complete basis in the usual sense, which poses challenges in the formulation of observables and the calculation of expectation values [1]. The non-unitary evolution of such systems requires the use of biorthogonal eigenstates, which are essential for defining a proper inner product and ensuring the consistency of the dynamics [1].\n\nThe implications of non-Hermitian time evolution extend beyond theoretical considerations, influencing practical applications in quantum information processing, photonic systems, and condensed matter physics. In quantum computing, for instance, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can be exploited to enhance the speed of state transformations and improve the resilience of quantum operations against decoherence [2]. In photonic systems, the manipulation of complex eigenvalues and non-orthogonal eigenstates can lead to novel functionalities, such as unidirectional waveguiding and topological protection of light [3].\n\nDespite the rich dynamical behavior of non-Hermitian systems, several challenges remain in their theoretical and experimental characterization. The presence of complex eigenvalues and non-orthogonal eigenstates necessitates the development of specialized numerical methods and analytical techniques to handle the non-unitary dynamics. Additionally, the stability of non-Hermitian topological states under perturbations and the role of exceptional points in phase transitions remain active areas of research [1].

These points emerge when the Hamiltonian matrix becomes defective, leading to the breakdown of the standard spectral decomposition and the emergence of non-trivial topological structures. The presence of EPs is not only a hallmark of non-Hermitian systems but also a critical factor in driving phase transitions and non-adiabatic dynamics. This subsection explores the role of EPs in non-Hermitian systems, highlighting their influence on the breakdown of adiabatic approximations and the emergence of singular behavior.\n\nAt the heart of EPs lies the non-Hermitian nature of the Hamiltonian, which allows for complex eigenvalues and non-orthogonal eigenstates. These features give rise to a rich interplay between the system's dynamics and its spectral properties. Near an EP, small perturbations can lead to large changes in the system's behavior, making the adiabatic approximation invalid. This breakdown is particularly significant in the context of non-adiabatic dynamics, where the system's evolution cannot be described by a slow, continuous change in the parameters. Instead, the system exhibits rapid transitions and singular behavior, which are essential for understanding the dynamics of open and dissipative systems [1].\n\nThe study of EPs has led to the development of novel analytical and numerical techniques to handle the complexities of non-Hermitian systems. For instance, the use of biorthogonal eigenstates and generalized topological invariants has provided deeper insights into the topological protection of states near EPs [1]. Additionally, the introduction of the FEAST eigensolver has enabled the efficient computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for large, non-Hermitian systems, facilitating the study of EPs in practical scenarios [1]. These advancements have not only enhanced our understanding of EPs but also opened new avenues for controlling and manipulating non-Hermitian systems.\n\nThe implications of EPs extend beyond theoretical interest, with significant applications in various fields. In photonics, EPs have been utilized to design robust photonic devices with enhanced performance, such as non-reciprocal waveguides and topological lasers [1]. In quantum information science, the unique properties of EPs have been leveraged to develop new protocols for quantum computing and sensing, where the robustness of topological states is crucial [1].

Unlike Hermitian systems, where the spectral theorem ensures orthogonal eigenstates and real eigenvalues, non-Hermitian systems can exhibit complex eigenvalues and non-orthogonal eigenstates, which significantly affect the stability and robustness of topological phases. The interplay between stability, non-Hermitian effects, and topological protection is intricate and has been the subject of extensive research. In this subsection, we explore the key mechanisms that govern the stability of non-Hermitian topological states and the role of symmetry in preserving their robustness.\n\nOne of the primary challenges in analyzing the stability of non-Hermitian topological states is the breakdown of conventional topological protection mechanisms. In Hermitian systems, topological invariants such as the Chern number or winding number are robust against local perturbations as long as the spectral gap remains open. However, in non-Hermitian systems, the presence of complex eigenvalues and non-Hermitian skin effects can lead to the localization of bulk states at the system boundaries, disrupting the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence [16]. This has motivated the development of generalized topological invariants, such as the biorthogonal Chern number and the non-Hermitian winding number, which account for the non-orthogonal nature of eigenstates [17]. These invariants provide a more accurate description of topological robustness in non-Hermitian systems and have been shown to remain stable under certain types of perturbations, particularly those that respect underlying symmetries [16].\n\nSymmetry plays a crucial role in stabilizing non-Hermitian topological states. In particular, the interplay between non-Hermitian symmetries such as PT symmetry and topological protection has been extensively studied. When PT symmetry is unbroken, the system exhibits real eigenvalues and can support stable topological edge states. However, when PT symmetry is broken, the eigenvalues become complex, leading to instabilities and potential transitions between different topological phases [16]. The stability of topological states under non-Hermitian perturbations is thus closely tied to the preservation of these symmetries. Recent studies have demonstrated that certain non-Hermitian systems can maintain topological protection even in the presence of gain and loss, provided the perturbations are carefully balanced [16].\n\nAnother important factor in the stability analysis of non-Hermitian topological states is the presence of exceptional points (EPs), where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. EPs can act as critical points for topological phase transitions and significantly affect the stability of topological states. Near EPs, the system becomes highly sensitive to perturbations, leading to non-adiabatic dynamics and possible instabilities [16]. However, in some cases, the robustness of topological states can be enhanced by leveraging the unique properties of EPs, such as their ability to localize and amplify signals [16].\n\nOverall, the stability of non-Hermitian topological states is a multifaceted issue that requires a careful analysis of symmetry, perturbations, and the interplay between non-Hermitian effects and topological protection. Future research will need to address the challenges of characterizing stability in more complex and higher-dimensional systems, as well as the development of robust experimental techniques for observing and controlling these states. Theoretical advancements in generalized topological invariants and numerical methods for simulating non-Hermitian systems will be crucial in this endeavor [16].",

Non-Hermitian systems, characterized by complex eigenvalues and non-orthogonal eigenstates, are inherently sensitive to the balance between gain and loss. This sensitivity can either enhance or degrade the topological protection of quantum and classical states, depending on the specific configuration and the strength of the non-Hermitian perturbations [18].\n\nIn the context of topological states, the robustness is often tied to the system’s ability to maintain its topological invariant despite the presence of non-Hermitian perturbations. Balanced gain and loss can stabilize topological states by preserving the symmetry of the system, such as parity-time (PT) symmetry, which is crucial for maintaining the non-Hermitian topological protection [6]. However, when the gain and loss are asymmetric or too strong, they can lead to the breakdown of topological protection, resulting in the emergence of non-adiabatic dynamics and the destruction of topological edge modes [19]. This highlights the delicate balance required to harness the advantages of non-Hermitian systems without compromising their topological robustness.\n\nThe impact of gain and loss is particularly evident in the formation and stability of exceptional points (EPs), which are critical for the emergence of non-Hermitian topological phases [18]. At EPs, eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, leading to singular behavior that can either enhance or destabilize the system. Careful engineering of gain and loss can be used to control the position and stability of EPs, thereby tuning the topological properties of the system. This offers a promising avenue for designing devices with tailored topological features, such as robust photonic waveguides or quantum circuits with enhanced stability [20].\n\nMoreover, the role of gain and loss in the non-Hermitian skin effect cannot be overlooked. The skin effect, where bulk states localize at the edges of the system, can be mitigated or enhanced by modulating the gain and loss profile. This provides a strategy for either suppressing or leveraging the skin effect to achieve desired transport properties in non-Hermitian topological systems [21]. The ability to control the skin effect through gain and loss opens up new possibilities for the design of topological devices with improved performance and resilience.\n\nFuture directions in this area include the development of more sophisticated control strategies that exploit the interplay between gain, loss, and topology. Advances in machine learning and data-driven methods are expected to play a significant role in optimizing these systems, enabling the design of robust and efficient topological devices [6].

These states are often localized at the boundaries of non-Hermitian systems and exhibit distinct robustness properties, such as enhanced stability under certain perturbations, or, conversely, susceptibility to exceptional points (EPs) that can drastically alter their behavior. The emergence of such states is closely tied to the spectral properties of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which, unlike Hermitian ones, do not necessarily have real eigenvalues or orthogonal eigenstates [17]. This departure from the standard quantum mechanical framework introduces both challenges and opportunities for understanding topological protection in non-Hermitian settings.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of non-Hermitian edge states is their sensitivity to the presence of gain and loss.

This subsection explores these aspects in depth, highlighting the key mechanisms that govern the stability of non-Hermitian edge modes.\n\nOne of the defining features of non-Hermitian systems is the emergence of exceptional points (EPs), where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. These singularities play a crucial role in the robustness of topological edge modes. Near EPs, the system exhibits enhanced sensitivity to perturbations, which can lead to phase transitions and the breakdown of topological protection [2]. However, when the system is tuned away from EPs, the robustness of the edge modes can be significantly enhanced. This behavior has been studied extensively in photonic and electronic systems, where non-Hermitian perturbations such as gain and loss can either destabilize or stabilize the edge states depending on their symmetry and strength [11; 2].\n\nNon-Hermitian symmetries, such as PT symmetry, also play a critical role in determining the stability of topological edge modes. In PT-symmetric systems, the balance between gain and loss can protect edge modes from decoherence and disorder, leading to a form of topological robustness that is distinct from the Hermitian case [1; 2]. However, this protection is not guaranteed and can be lost when the system is driven beyond the PT-symmetry breaking threshold, leading to a transition to a non-topological phase [13]. Recent studies have shown that the robustness of non-Hermitian edge modes can be further enhanced by engineering the system to exhibit a non-Hermitian skin effect, where bulk states localize at the boundaries, effectively decoupling them from the perturbations [15; 1].\n\nThe stability of non-Hermitian edge modes under external perturbations has also been analyzed using numerical and analytical techniques. For instance, the FEAST eigensolver has been employed to compute the spectra of non-Hermitian systems, revealing how edge modes persist under spatial inhomogeneities and disorder [1]. Additionally, the use of matrix pencils with positive semidefinite Hermitian parts has provided a framework for understanding the stability of non-Hermitian linear systems under perturbations [23]. These methods have confirmed that non-Hermitian systems can maintain topological robustness in certain parameter regimes, even when conventional Hermitian protection mechanisms fail.\n\nLooking ahead, the study of non-Hermitian edge modes under perturbations is poised to benefit from advances in machine learning and data-driven approaches, which can help identify optimal parameter regimes and predict the behavior of complex non-Hermitian systems [1; 3].

These experiments highlight the potential of non-Hermitian systems to overcome some of the limitations of Hermitian topological insulators, such as sensitivity to disorder and the need for strict symmetry protection.\n\nThe role of non-Hermitian effects in modifying conventional topological protection is a central theme in this subsection. While Hermitian topological insulators are typically protected by symmetry, non-Hermitian systems can exhibit topological protection even in the absence of such symmetries. This is due to the interplay between non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence and the emergence of exceptional points, which can act as robust topological markers [1]. These findings suggest that non-Hermitian topological insulators may provide a more general framework for understanding topological phases, beyond the constraints of Hermitian symmetry classes.\n\nLooking ahead, the development of non-Hermitian topological insulators in condensed matter systems presents both challenges and opportunities. The integration of non-Hermitian effects into existing topological material platforms requires careful control over gain and loss mechanisms, as well as the development of new theoretical tools to characterize non-Hermitian topological invariants. Nevertheless, the unique properties of these systems offer exciting prospects for applications in quantum information processing, photonic devices, and robust transport in open systems. As experimental and theoretical techniques continue to advance, non-Hermitian topological insulators are poised to play a pivotal role in the next generation of topological materials and devices.",

By leveraging the unique properties of non-Hermitian systems, such as exceptional points (EPs) and non-Hermitian skin effects, researchers have demonstrated unprecedented control over light propagation, enabling robust waveguiding, unidirectional transport, and enhanced optical functionalities. These developments are particularly promising for the design of photonic circuits, topological lasers, and quantum photonic devices, where traditional Hermitian topological frameworks often fall short due to their sensitivity to disorder and imperfections.\n\nA central concept in non-Hermitian photonic systems is the use of EPs, where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, leading to non-trivial topological structures and phase transitions. These points serve as critical points in the spectral flow and can be harnessed to engineer robust topological states. For instance, in photonic lattices with balanced gain and loss, EPs can be used to achieve unidirectional light propagation, where waves propagate in one direction without reflection, a property that is highly desirable for optical isolators and circulators [9]. This is particularly advantageous in integrated photonic circuits, where parasitic reflections and backscattering are major challenges.\n\nTopological photonic crystals and waveguides have also been explored as a means of achieving robust light propagation in the presence of disorder. By incorporating non-Hermitian effects such as gain and loss, these systems can exhibit topologically protected edge states that are resilient to perturbations. The non-Hermitian Chern number and biorthogonal Chern number provide a framework for characterizing these phases, allowing for the design of photonic structures with non-trivial topological properties [8]. This has led to the realization of photonic systems that support unidirectional edge modes, which can be used to guide light along predefined paths with minimal loss.\n\nAnother promising application is in the development of non-Hermitian topological lasers. By exploiting the unique properties of EPs, these lasers can achieve single-mode lasing with enhanced sensitivity and stability. The non-Hermitian topology ensures that the laser modes are robust against structural imperfections, making them ideal for applications in optical communications and sensing. Recent experimental demonstrations have confirmed the feasibility of such systems, showing that they can outperform conventional lasers in terms of coherence and directionality [30].\n\nThe integration of machine learning and topology optimization has further advanced the design of non-Hermitian photonic systems. These techniques allow for the efficient exploration of complex design spaces, enabling the discovery of novel photonic structures with tailored topological properties. By combining these methods with traditional photonic design principles, researchers are pushing the boundaries of what is possible in non-Hermitian photonic systems.\n\nLooking ahead, the future of non-Hermitian topological photonics lies in the development of scalable, integrated devices that can operate over a wide range of frequencies and geometries. Challenges remain in achieving stable and controllable non-Hermitian effects in practical systems, but the rapid progress in both theoretical and experimental studies suggests that these hurdles are surmountable.

Photonic, electronic, and mechanical systems have emerged as key experimental frameworks, each offering unique advantages and challenges in capturing the non-Hermitian dynamics and topological features. These platforms provide a critical bridge between theoretical predictions and practical observations, enabling the study of phenomena such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and robust edge states.\n\nPhotonic systems have been particularly successful in exploring non-Hermitian topological phenomena due to their high tunability and the ability to engineer gain and loss profiles.

      "content": "The measurement of topological invariants in non-Hermitian systems presents a host of experimental and theoretical challenges that distinguish them from their Hermitian counterparts. Unlike Hermitian systems, where topological invariants are often defined using the Berry phase or Chern number, non-Hermitian systems exhibit complex eigenvalues, non-orthogonal eigenstates, and exceptional points (EPs), which complicate the conventional definitions and measurement protocols. The absence of a well-defined inner product and the presence of non-unitary evolution further hinder the direct application of traditional topological probes, such as the Chern number or the Zakharov-Shabat spectrum [31]. These challenges necessitate the development of new measurement strategies that account for the unique spectral and dynamical features of non-Hermitian systems.\n\nOne major difficulty in measuring non-Hermitian topological invariants lies in the extraction of robust invariants from experimental data, especially in the presence of disorder, noise, and non-ideal boundary conditions. Traditional topological probes, which rely on the assumption of Hermitian Hamiltonians, often fail in non-Hermitian settings due to the breakdown of the spectral theorem and the non-orthogonality of eigenstates. For example, in systems with complex eigenvalues, the conventional band structure analysis becomes inadequate, and the topological structure may be obscured by the interplay between gain and loss [32]. Moreover, the presence of EPs introduces singularities in the spectrum that can drastically alter the topological phase diagram, making it challenging to distinguish between different topological phases [33].\n\nAnother key challenge is the accurate detection and quantification of EPs, which are critical for the topological characterization of non-Hermitian systems. The coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors at EPs leads to non-trivial phase transitions and can significantly affect the robustness of topological states. However, experimental detection of EPs requires high precision and advanced measurement techniques, as the small deviations from EPs can lead to significant changes in the system's topology [30]. Additionally, the numerical computation of topological invariants in non-Hermitian systems demands specialized algorithms that can handle the non-Hermitian nature of the Hamiltonian, such as the use of biorthogonal Chern numbers or the development of contour-integral-based methods [34].\n\nRecent advances in computational methods, such as the FEAST eigensolver and spectral decomposition techniques, have begun to address some of these challenges by enabling the efficient and accurate computation of non-Hermitian eigenvalues and invariants [32; 33]. These methods are closely aligned with the developments discussed in the preceding subsection on computational techniques, as they provide essential tools for both theoretical analysis and experimental interpretation. However, the integration of these methods with experimental platforms remains an ongoing challenge. Machine learning and data-driven approaches are also emerging as promising tools for the characterization and prediction of non-Hermitian topological states, though their application in this context is still in its infancy [8].\n\nFuture research in this area will likely focus on the development of robust experimental protocols for measuring non-Hermitian topological invariants, the refinement of numerical algorithms to handle large-scale non-Hermitian systems, and the exploration of novel topological phenomena enabled by non-Hermitian dynamics. The ability to accurately measure and manipulate these invariants will be crucial for the realization of practical applications in quantum information processing, photonics, and condensed matter physics.",

These invariants are critical for characterizing the topological phases of non-Hermitian systems. The generalized FEAST algorithm, which leverages Cauchy integrals for eigenvalue extraction, has demonstrated remarkable performance in large-scale simulations by retaining the multi-level parallelism of its Hermitian counterpart.\n\nTopological data analysis (TDA) has also emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing non-Hermitian systems, particularly in identifying robust topological features such as persistent homology and Betti numbers [20].
