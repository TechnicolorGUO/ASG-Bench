      "content": "The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework has emerged as a cornerstone for ensuring transparency and rigor in systematic reviews, originally developed for health sciences [1]. Its principles, emphasizing structured reporting and methodological clarity, have since been adapted to various disciplines, including ecological and evolutionary biology. This adaptation is particularly vital given the unique challenges inherent in ecological and evolutionary research, which often involve complex, heterogeneous, and temporally dynamic datasets [2]. The need for a specialized PRISMA extension in these fields arises from the necessity to account for factors such as spatial and temporal variability, phylogenetic relationships, and the integration of diverse data types, which are not fully addressed by conventional reporting guidelines [3].\n\nSystematic reviews play a critical role in ecological and evolutionary research by synthesizing evidence from multiple studies, thereby enhancing the robustness of conclusions and informing policy and management decisions [4]. However, the complexity of ecological systems and the variability of evolutionary processes necessitate a reporting framework that can accommodate these intricacies. The PRISMA extension for ecology and evolutionary biology is designed to address this need by incorporating domain-specific reporting items that reflect the unique characteristics of ecological and evolutionary datasets [5]. This extension not only enhances the reproducibility of reviews but also improves the interpretability of findings by integrating phylogenetic and ecological data [6].\n\nThe rationale for this survey is rooted in the growing recognition of the need for standardized reporting in ecological and evolutionary research. While existing guidelines such as the ARRIVE and STROBE statements provide valuable frameworks, they are not specifically tailored to the complexities of ecological and evolutionary studies [7]. The PRISMA extension aims to fill this gap by offering a structured approach that facilitates the transparent and comprehensive reporting of systematic reviews in these domains.\n\nThis survey is structured to provide a comprehensive analysis of the PRISMA extension for ecological and evolutionary biology. It begins with an overview of the PRISMA framework and its core principles, followed by a discussion of its evolution from health sciences to ecological contexts. The survey then examines the significance of structured reporting in ecological and evolutionary studies, highlighting its role in enhancing reproducibility and methodological consistency. Finally, it introduces the objectives and scope of this survey, which include evaluating the effectiveness of the PRISMA extension, identifying key challenges, and proposing future directions for its development [8]. By synthesizing current knowledge and identifying gaps, this survey aims to contribute to the ongoing refinement of PRISMA for ecological and evolutionary research.",

      "content": "The early adoption and adaptation of PRISMA in ecological research marked a pivotal shift toward structured, transparent, and reproducible methodologies in systematic reviews. While PRISMA was initially developed for health sciences, its principles resonated with ecologists and evolutionary biologists who sought to address the inherent complexity and variability of their data. The initial recognition of PRISMA's utility in ecological studies emerged from a growing awareness of the need for standardized reporting to enhance the credibility and reliability of meta-analyses and systematic reviews [4]. Researchers recognized that the PRISMA framework, with its checklist and flow diagram, could be adapted to better capture the nuances of ecological and evolutionary research, which often involves heterogeneous data, spatial and temporal variability, and intricate phylogenetic relationships [3].\n\nEarly case studies and pilot applications of PRISMA in ecological meta-analyses laid the groundwork for its adaptation. These studies revealed that while PRISMA's core elements—such as clear study selection criteria, transparent data extraction, and explicit reporting of search strategies—were relevant, they required modification to align with the unique challenges of ecological datasets. For example, the inclusion of phylogenetic information and the handling of spatially structured data posed significant methodological hurdles that were not addressed by the original PRISMA guidelines [5]. Researchers began to explore ways to integrate these elements into the PRISMA framework, leading to the development of domain-specific adaptations such as PRISMA-ECO [9].\n\nOne of the primary challenges faced by researchers in applying PRISMA to ecological datasets was the high variability and complexity of the data. Ecological studies often involve multiple data types, including genetic, morphological, and environmental data, which are difficult to harmonize under a single reporting framework [10]. Furthermore, the lack of standardized metadata and the absence of clear reporting guidelines for ecological and evolutionary data complicated the application of PRISMA's rigid structure. This led to early calls for more flexible and domain-specific criteria that could accommodate the diversity of ecological research contexts [7].\n\nInterdisciplinary collaboration played a crucial role in shaping the early PRISMA extension for ecology. Ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and data scientists worked together to refine the framework, integrating new data types and methodological approaches. This collaborative effort not only enhanced the adaptability of PRISMA but also underscored the importance of community engagement in the development of reporting standards [11]. As the field progressed, these early efforts laid the foundation for the evolution of PRISMA into a more robust and versatile tool for ecological and evolutionary research, paving the way for future refinements and broader adoption.",

      "content": "The evolution of PRISMA guidelines to accommodate ecological and evolutionary data reflects a dynamic and iterative process driven by the unique challenges of these disciplines. Initially designed for health sciences, PRISMA's rigid structure was found insufficient to address the complexity, variability, and multidimensionality of ecological and evolutionary data. This necessitated the development of domain-specific adaptations that emphasize methodological flexibility, the integration of novel data types, and enhanced transparency in reporting. Over time, the PRISMA extension for ecology and evolutionary biology has undergone significant refinements, incorporating principles from ecological theory, phylogenetic analysis, and spatial statistics to improve the rigor and reproducibility of systematic reviews [12].\n\nOne of the most critical shifts in the evolution of PRISMA has been the move from a one-size-fits-all reporting framework to a more nuanced and context-sensitive approach. Early versions of PRISMA were criticized for their inability to capture the hierarchical and non-linear nature of ecological and evolutionary processes, such as phylogenetic relationships, environmental gradients, and long-term ecological dynamics. In response, researchers have emphasized the need for modular reporting standards that can accommodate these complexities. For instance, the inclusion of phylogenetic and spatial data into the PRISMA framework has enabled more accurate synthesis of findings related to species distributions and evolutionary adaptation [12]. This shift has been supported by methodological advancements in handling missing data, heterogeneity, and uncertainty—key challenges in ecological datasets [12].\n\nAnother significant development has been the integration of new data types, such as remote sensing, environmental variables, and multi-omics data, into PRISMA reporting. These data types require specialized handling to ensure methodological consistency and comparability across studies. As a result, the PRISMA extension now includes guidelines for the transparent reporting of statistical methods, data preprocessing, and model validation, which are critical for ecological and evolutionary meta-analyses [12]. Furthermore, community feedback and consensus-building have played a central role in shaping the updated PRISMA guidelines, ensuring that they align with the evolving needs of the research community [12].\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain. The diversity of ecological and evolutionary research contexts continues to pose difficulties in standardizing reporting practices. Future refinements to PRISMA should focus on enhancing interoperability with emerging tools and frameworks, improving the integration of machine learning and AI techniques, and fostering broader adoption through training and education initiatives. By addressing these challenges, the PRISMA extension can continue to evolve as a robust and adaptable tool for enhancing the quality and transparency of systematic reviews in ecology and evolutionary biology.",

      "content": "The development and refinement of the PRISMA extension for ecological and evolutionary biology have been shaped by a series of pivotal studies, initiatives, and collaborative efforts that have sought to address the unique challenges of these disciplines. These contributions have not only guided the evolution of the PRISMA framework but have also highlighted the necessity of domain-specific adaptations to ensure the transparency, reproducibility, and methodological rigor of systematic reviews in ecological and evolutionary research.\n\nOne of the earliest and most influential initiatives in this regard was the PRISMA-ECO extension, which was developed to address the specific reporting needs of ecological meta-analyses [12]. This extension introduced guidelines for handling the complexity of ecological data, including the integration of spatial, temporal, and phylogenetic information, as well as strategies for managing missing data and uncertainty [12]. The PRISMA-ECO framework laid the groundwork for subsequent adaptations, emphasizing the need for flexibility and context-specific criteria that reflect the variability inherent in ecological datasets.\n\nThe Biodiversity Research Network (BRN) and the Tree of Life initiative have also played a critical role in shaping the PRISMA extension [12]. These large-scale collaborative efforts provided a platform for synthesizing biodiversity data and highlighted the importance of integrating phylogenetic and ecological information in systematic reviews. The BRN, in particular, emphasized the need for standardized reporting protocols that facilitate data sharing and cross-study comparisons, influencing the design of the PRISMA extension for ecological and evolutionary contexts.\n\nThe open science and reproducibility movement has further driven the development and adoption of the PRISMA extension [12]. The movement's emphasis on transparency, data sharing, and methodological rigor has encouraged researchers to adopt more structured and standardized reporting practices. This has led to the incorporation of guidelines for data availability, code sharing, and detailed methodology descriptions, which are now integral to the PRISMA extension. The MELIBEA score, which assesses the effectiveness of open access mandates, has also informed the design of reporting standards that promote reproducibility and data accessibility in ecological research [12].\n\nCollaborative efforts among journals, funding agencies, and research organizations have been instrumental in promoting the adoption of the PRISMA extension. Journals such as *Ecology Letters* and *Evolutionary Ecology* have mandated the use of PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews, while funding agencies like the National Science Foundation (NSF) have encouraged the inclusion of structured reporting in grant applications [13]. These institutional initiatives have helped to standardize the use of PRISMA in ecological and evolutionary research, increasing its visibility and impact.\n\nEmerging trends in the field highlight the growing need for further refinement of the PRISMA extension. Advances in machine learning and big data analytics have introduced new challenges and opportunities for systematic reviews, particularly in the integration of high-dimensional and heterogeneous datasets. Future directions for the PRISMA extension include the development of guidelines for the use of AI-based methods in ecological and evolutionary meta-analyses, as well as the incorporation of dynamic and adaptive reporting frameworks that accommodate the evolving nature of ecological systems. As the field continues to evolve, the PRISMA extension will need to remain adaptable, responsive to new methodological developments, and grounded in the unique epistemological and methodological needs of ecological and evolutionary research.",

      "content": "The PRISMA extension for ecological and evolutionary biology represents a critical adaptation of the original PRISMA framework, tailored to address the unique challenges of these disciplines, such as high data variability, complex ecological interactions, and the integration of phylogenetic and spatial data. However, its application and effectiveness must be evaluated in comparison to other reporting standards and frameworks that are commonly used in ecological and evolutionary research. This subsection provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of the PRISMA extension with key reporting standards, including the ARRIVE guidelines for animal research, the STROBE statement for observational studies, the CONSORT guidelines for randomized trials, and the ECO-CHECK and PRISMA-PE for ecological and environmental studies. These comparisons highlight the unique features, advantages, and limitations of the PRISMA extension in the ecological context.\n\nThe ARRIVE guidelines, primarily designed for animal research, emphasize transparency in experimental design and reporting, but they lack the specificity required for ecological and evolutionary studies, where controlled experiments are often challenging to implement [12]. Similarly, the STROBE statement, intended for observational studies, provides a structured approach to reporting cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies, yet it does not account for the spatial and temporal complexities inherent in ecological data [12]. The CONSORT guidelines, while robust for clinical trials, are less applicable to ecological settings due to the absence of randomization and blinding in most ecological experiments [12]. In contrast, the PRISMA extension explicitly incorporates elements of ecological and evolutionary data, such as the inclusion of phylogenetic information, spatial and temporal variability, and the integration of multiple data types [12].\n\nThe ECO-CHECK and PRISMA-PE, specifically designed for ecological and environmental research, offer a closer alignment with the PRISMA extension, particularly in their emphasis on transparency and reproducibility in the synthesis of ecological data. However, while ECO-CHECK provides a checklist for evaluating the quality of ecological studies, it lacks the systematic review structure that PRISMA-PE and the PRISMA extension provide [12]. Furthermore, the PRISMA extension's focus on structured reporting, data integration, and methodological transparency positions it as a more comprehensive framework for addressing the methodological challenges of ecological and evolutionary research compared to other standards.\n\nDespite its strengths, the PRISMA extension also faces limitations, particularly in its adaptability to the dynamic and interdisciplinary nature of ecological and evolutionary studies. For instance, the framework may not fully capture the complexity of evolutionary processes or the nuances of multivariate ecological datasets, which often require more flexible and context-specific reporting standards [13]. Additionally, the integration of machine learning and AI-driven tools into the PRISMA extension remains an underdeveloped area, highlighting the need for continued refinement and innovation [14].\n\nIn conclusion, the PRISMA extension for ecology and evolutionary biology offers a more tailored and comprehensive approach compared to other reporting standards, but its effectiveness is contingent upon ongoing adaptation to the evolving needs of the field. Future developments should focus on enhancing its flexibility, incorporating emerging technologies, and improving its alignment with interdisciplinary research practices.",

      "content": "The adaptation of PRISMA for ecological and evolutionary research is grounded in a reevaluation of the epistemological and methodological assumptions that underpin systematic reviews. Traditional PRISMA guidelines, originally developed for health sciences, are built on a framework that assumes controlled, replicable experimental conditions, standardized reporting, and a relatively homogeneous data landscape. However, ecological and evolutionary systems are inherently complex, characterized by high variability, scale dependence, and non-linear interactions among biotic and abiotic factors. This necessitates a theoretical reorientation that accommodates the unique epistemological challenges of these fields, where data are often observational, heterogeneous, and influenced by historical and environmental contingencies [12].\n\nThe epistemological basis for structured reporting in ecological and evolutionary research is rooted in the need to address the intrinsic complexity and uncertainty of these domains. Unlike the health sciences, where controlled experiments dominate, ecological and evolutionary studies frequently rely on observational data, long-term monitoring, and comparative analyses across diverse environments. This requires systematic review frameworks to explicitly account for spatial and temporal variability, as well as the integration of phylogenetic, ecological, and environmental data [12]. Such considerations are not merely methodological but epistemological, reflecting a shift from the experimental paradigm to a more integrative and data-driven approach to knowledge synthesis.\n\nA critical theoretical challenge lies in aligning PRISMA's structured reporting with the dynamic and often non-hierarchical nature of ecological and evolutionary processes. For instance, evolutionary relationships are not linear but are best represented as phylogenetic trees, which must be incorporated into the review process to capture the historical context of species interactions [12]. Similarly, ecological systems are often analyzed through network-based models, where modules and interactions are key to understanding community structure and function [12]. These complexities necessitate methodological adjustments in study selection, data integration, and reporting standards, which the PRISMA extension explicitly addresses.\n\nMoreover, the need for structured reporting in ecological and evolutionary contexts is driven by the increasing demand for reproducibility and transparency in scientific research. Ecological data are often plagued by issues such as missing values, inconsistent metadata, and sampling biases, which can undermine the reliability of meta-analyses and systematic reviews [12]. PRISMA's extension provides a framework for systematically addressing these challenges through standardized data collection, transparent methodology, and rigorous quality assessment [13]. This aligns with broader trends in open science, where reproducibility and data sharing are increasingly emphasized as cornerstones of scientific integrity [12].\n\nFuture developments in the PRISMA extension for ecological and evolutionary research must continue to evolve in response to emerging methodological challenges and technological advancements. This includes integrating machine learning and artificial intelligence for more sophisticated data analysis, as well as enhancing the framework's adaptability to new data types and research paradigms [12]. By maintaining a balance between structure and flexibility, the PRISMA extension can continue to serve as a vital tool for synthesizing ecological and evolutionary knowledge in an increasingly data-rich scientific landscape.",

      "content": "The methodological adjustments required to adapt the PRISMA framework for ecological and evolutionary research reflect the inherent complexity, scale, and interconnectedness of these domains. Unlike traditional health sciences, where systematic reviews often rely on controlled experiments and homogenous data, ecological and evolutionary studies involve heterogeneous, non-experimental datasets that span vast spatial and temporal scales. To address these challenges, PRISMA extensions have been designed to incorporate specialized reporting standards that account for the variability and multifaceted nature of ecological and evolutionary processes [12; 12; 14]. These adjustments emphasize the need for more flexible, domain-specific criteria that can accommodate the diversity of ecological data types, such as phylogenetic trees, species distribution models, and environmental variables.\n\nOne key methodological adjustment is the refinement of study selection and inclusion criteria to reflect the specific characteristics of ecological and evolutionary research. Traditional PRISMA guidelines often assume a clear delineation of study populations and interventions, which is less applicable in ecological contexts where natural variability and environmental interactions complicate such definitions. For example, in ecological meta-analyses, researchers must account for spatial and temporal heterogeneity, which can significantly affect the interpretation of findings [14; 15]. To address this, the PRISMA extension incorporates guidelines for handling missing data, heterogeneity, and uncertainty in ecological datasets, ensuring that the reporting process remains transparent and robust [16; 12].\n\nAnother critical adjustment is the integration of evolutionary relationships and phylogenetic data into the PRISMA reporting framework. Evolutionary processes are inherently linked to the genetic and historical relationships among species, and their accurate representation is essential for understanding ecological dynamics. The PRISMA extension includes provisions for reporting phylogenetic data, such as the use of phylogenetic trees to contextualize species interactions and evolutionary histories [12; 12]. This approach not only enhances the interpretability of review findings but also aligns with the broader goal of integrating multiple data types into a cohesive analytical framework.\n\nAdditionally, the PRISMA extension addresses the challenges of handling multivariate and high-dimensional ecological datasets. These datasets often involve complex interactions among multiple environmental variables, which require advanced statistical and computational techniques for analysis. To support this, the PRISMA extension advocates for transparent reporting of statistical methods, including data preprocessing, model specification, and uncertainty quantification. By explicitly documenting these processes, the framework ensures that ecological and evolutionary meta-analyses remain reproducible and scientifically rigorous [13; 12].\n\nLooking ahead, future refinements to the PRISMA extension will likely focus on enhancing its adaptability to emerging data types and methodological approaches. As ecological and evolutionary research continues to evolve, the PRISMA framework must remain flexible and responsive to new challenges, ensuring that it remains a valuable tool for structured, transparent, and high-quality systematic reviews in these fields [12; 12].",

      "content": "The integration of ecological and evolutionary data types within the PRISMA extension is a critical component of its methodological foundation, reflecting the complex and multifaceted nature of ecological and evolutionary research. Unlike traditional PRISMA guidelines, which are primarily designed for health sciences, the extension must accommodate a diverse array of data types, including phylogenetic trees, species distribution models (SDMs), and environmental variables. This integration is not merely a technical challenge but also a conceptual one, requiring a reevaluation of how data are collected, analyzed, and reported within systematic reviews.\n\nPhylogenetic trees, which represent evolutionary relationships among species, are a cornerstone of evolutionary biology. Their inclusion in PRISMA-based reviews is essential for understanding the historical context of species interactions and adaptations. However, the integration of phylogenetic data into systematic reviews is often complicated by the need to account for the hierarchical and non-independent nature of evolutionary relationships. For instance, the method described in [17] emphasizes the importance of incorporating phylogenetic information to avoid biased inferences, particularly when analyzing traits that may have evolved through common ancestry. The PRISMA extension must therefore provide clear guidelines for reporting phylogenetic data, including the methods used to construct and validate phylogenetic trees, as well as the assumptions underlying such analyses.\n\nSpecies distribution models (SDMs) are another key data type that must be integrated into the PRISMA framework. SDMs are widely used to predict the geographic distribution of species based on environmental variables, making them invaluable for understanding the impacts of climate change and habitat fragmentation. However, the complexity of SDMs, which often involve multiple predictor variables and non-linear relationships, poses significant challenges for systematic review. The work by [18] highlights the importance of reporting the specific environmental variables used in SDMs, as well as the algorithms and validation techniques employed. The PRISMA extension must ensure that these details are clearly documented to enhance transparency and reproducibility.\n\nEnvironmental variables, such as temperature, precipitation, and soil type, are also critical for ecological studies. These variables are often highly variable in space and time, requiring careful consideration of how they are measured, aggregated, and analyzed. The challenges of handling such data are discussed in [2], which emphasizes the need for standardized protocols and clear documentation of data preprocessing steps. The PRISMA extension must address these issues by providing guidance on the reporting of environmental data, including the spatial and temporal resolution of measurements and the methods used to account for spatial autocorrelation.\n\nIn addition to these data types, the PRISMA extension must also address the integration of multi-source data, such as genomic, morphological, and ecological data. The work by [19] demonstrates the potential of combining these data types to provide a more comprehensive understanding of ecological and evolutionary processes. However, the integration of such data requires careful consideration of data harmonization and standardization. The PRISMA extension must therefore include best practices for data integration, ensuring that the results of systematic reviews are both accurate and meaningful.\n\nFinally, the integration of ecological and evolutionary data types within the PRISMA framework presents several challenges, including the need for domain-specific expertise and the potential for data heterogeneity. Emerging trends, such as the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence, offer promising solutions to these challenges, as discussed in [19]. These tools can help automate data processing, improve model accuracy, and enhance the interpretability of results. As the field of ecological and evolutionary research continues to evolve, the PRISMA extension must remain adaptable, incorporating new methodologies and technologies to ensure that systematic reviews remain relevant and effective.",

Ecological and evolutionary studies often involve complex, heterogeneous data that require specialized criteria to ensure the validity and reproducibility of systematic reviews. Traditional PRISMA guidelines, originally developed for health sciences, must be adapted to accommodate the unique characteristics of ecological and evolutionary datasets, such as spatial and temporal variability, phylogenetic dependencies, and multidimensional environmental interactions. This adaptation necessitates a nuanced approach to study selection and evaluation that aligns with the epistemological and methodological foundations of ecological and evolutionary science [20].\n\nA key criterion for study selection in ecological and evolutionary research is methodological rigor. Researchers must assess the quality of studies based on the clarity of research design, the appropriateness of statistical methods, and the transparency of data collection and analysis [21]. This includes evaluating the representativeness of samples, the control of confounding variables, and the extent to which studies address the specific ecological or evolutionary questions at hand. For instance, studies that incorporate phylogenetic data must be evaluated for their use of appropriate models and the integration of evolutionary relationships into the analysis [22]. Such criteria ensure that the findings of the review are robust and generalizable across different ecological contexts.\n\nData quality is another critical factor in evaluating ecological and evolutionary studies. The variability and incompleteness of ecological data, combined with the challenges of data standardization, require rigorous checks for data accuracy and consistency [10]. This involves assessing the completeness of datasets, the reliability of measurements, and the potential biases introduced by sampling strategies. Furthermore, the integration of diverse data types—such as species distribution models, environmental variables, and remote sensing data—requires careful evaluation of how well these data are synthesized and contextualized within the review framework [22].\n\nRelevance to ecological and evolutionary questions is a core criterion that ensures the practical utility of the review. Studies must be evaluated for their alignment with the research objectives, their contribution to understanding ecological processes or evolutionary dynamics, and their applicability to broader scientific or conservation goals [23]. This includes considering the temporal and spatial scale of the studies, as well as their ability to capture the dynamic and multifaceted nature of ecological and evolutionary systems [24].\n\nEmerging trends in ecological and evolutionary research, such as the use of machine learning for data synthesis and the increasing emphasis on open science, present both opportunities and challenges for study selection and evaluation [25; 26]. As the field continues to evolve, the criteria for study selection and evaluation must be continuously refined to reflect new methodologies, data sources, and analytical approaches. Future developments in the PRISMA extension will need to incorporate these advancements to ensure the continued relevance and effectiveness of systematic reviews in ecological and evolutionary research.",

      "content": "The structural elements of study design and methodological choices are foundational to the effective application of the PRISMA extension in ecological and evolutionary research. Unlike traditional systematic reviews, which often assume homogeneity and controlled conditions, ecological and evolutionary studies must account for the inherent variability, spatial and temporal scales, and complex interactions that define natural systems. This necessitates a methodological framework that is both flexible and rigorous, capable of addressing the unique challenges of ecological data while maintaining the transparency and reproducibility that PRISMA emphasizes. The study design must be carefully aligned with the research objectives, ensuring that the methodological choices reflect the domain-specific characteristics of ecological and evolutionary data.\n\nA key consideration in study design is the alignment of spatial and temporal scales with the research question. Ecological and evolutionary processes often operate across multiple scales, from individual organisms to entire ecosystems, and from short-term interactions to long-term evolutionary trends. This requires methodologies that can integrate multi-scale data while maintaining coherence and interpretability. For instance, spatial heterogeneity in ecological data can be addressed through stratified sampling strategies and the use of spatially explicit models, as highlighted in the work of [12]. Another critical aspect is the integration of interdisciplinary approaches, as ecological and evolutionary research often involves the synthesis of data from diverse disciplines, including genetics, environmental science, and computational biology. This necessitates methodological frameworks that can accommodate a wide range of data types, such as phylogenetic trees, species distribution models, and environmental variables. The PRISMA extension must therefore support the inclusion of such data while ensuring that the reporting standards are consistent and transparent. The work of [14] provides valuable insights into the challenges of integrating diverse data types and highlights the need for standardized protocols to facilitate data harmonization.\n\nIn addition, the selection of appropriate research questions and hypotheses is essential for the effective application of the PRISMA extension. Ecological and evolutionary research often involves complex, non-linear relationships, which require methodological approaches that can capture these dynamics. This includes the use of advanced statistical methods, such as generalized additive models and mixed-effects models, to account for non-normality, heterogeneity, and missing data. The work of [12] and [12] provides empirical evidence of the effectiveness of such approaches in improving the accuracy and reliability of ecological meta-analyses.\n\nFinally, the methodological framework must also address the challenges of reproducibility and transparency in ecological and evolutionary research. This includes the implementation of open science practices, such as data sharing and pre-registration of study protocols. The work of [12] and [27] underscores the importance of these practices in enhancing the credibility and impact of ecological research. As the field continues to evolve, future directions for the PRISMA extension should focus on the development of more adaptive and context-sensitive reporting standards that can better accommodate the dynamic and complex nature of ecological and evolutionary data.",

Given the inherent complexity, variability, and spatial-temporal dynamics of ecological and evolutionary datasets, the PRISMA extension emphasizes the need for rigorous, transparent, and adaptable approaches to data gathering. This subsection explores the critical considerations and methodological adaptations required to ensure representativeness, consistency, and scientific validity in data collection for ecological and evolutionary studies.\n\nA central challenge in ecological research is the heterogeneity of data sources, which may include field observations, remote sensing data, phylogenetic trees, and environmental variables. To address this, stratified and randomized sampling techniques are often employed to ensure that datasets are representative of the broader ecological or evolutionary context [2]. These methods help mitigate biases that can arise from uneven sampling across different spatial or temporal scales. For instance, stratified sampling allows for the inclusion of diverse habitats or species groups, while randomized sampling enhances the generalizability of findings by reducing the risk of overrepresentation of certain categories [18].\n\nAdaptive sampling strategies are also gaining prominence, particularly in long-term ecological monitoring and evolutionary studies. These strategies allow researchers to adjust sampling intensity and methods based on preliminary findings, thereby improving data quality and efficiency. Such flexibility is essential in ecological contexts where environmental conditions and species interactions can change dynamically [18]. For example, in studies of climate change impacts on species distributions, adaptive sampling can help capture rare or transient events that may be critical for understanding broader ecological trends.\n\nThe integration of remote sensing and field-based data collection methods is another key aspect of modern sampling strategies in ecological and evolutionary research. Remote sensing technologies, such as satellite imagery and LiDAR, provide high-resolution spatial data that can be combined with ground-truth data to improve the accuracy of ecological models [28]. This hybrid approach not only enhances the spatial coverage of datasets but also allows for the validation of model outputs against empirical observations.\n\nDocumentation of sampling protocols and data collection procedures is equally important for ensuring transparency and reproducibility, which are core tenets of the PRISMA extension. Detailed records of sampling locations, timing, and methods allow for the replication of studies and the comparison of findings across different research contexts [29]. Furthermore, the use of standardized metadata formats and ontologies facilitates the integration of diverse datasets, enhancing the interoperability of ecological and evolutionary research [10].\n\nIn conclusion, the development and implementation of sampling methods and data collection strategies in ecological and evolutionary research must be guided by a commitment to representativeness, adaptability, and transparency. As ecological data continue to grow in complexity and volume, future research should focus on the development of more sophisticated sampling frameworks that can accommodate emerging data types and technological advancements while maintaining scientific rigor [2]. The integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence in sampling and data collection is an area of significant potential, offering new opportunities for improving the efficiency and accuracy of ecological and evolutionary research.",

      "content": "The integration of phylogenetic and ecological information within the PRISMA extension represents a critical advancement in the systematic review of ecological and evolutionary studies. Traditional systematic review frameworks often fail to account for the complex, hierarchical nature of evolutionary relationships and the spatial and temporal dynamics of ecological processes. The PRISMA extension addresses this gap by explicitly incorporating phylogenetic data and ecological context, thereby enhancing the interpretability and robustness of review findings. This subsection examines the methods, challenges, and benefits of integrating these two domains within the PRISMA framework, emphasizing their mutual complementarity in ecological and evolutionary research.\n\nPhylogenetic data provide a historical and evolutionary context that is essential for understanding the relationships among species and the processes that have shaped biodiversity. By incorporating phylogenetic trees into the review process, researchers can better account for shared ancestry and evolutionary divergence, which are key factors in interpreting ecological patterns and processes [30]. This integration allows for a more nuanced analysis of how traits, behaviors, and ecological functions have evolved across species, providing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving ecological interactions and community structure.\n\nEcological data, on the other hand, offer a snapshot of current environmental conditions, species distributions, and ecosystem dynamics. These data are crucial for assessing the impacts of environmental change, human activities, and conservation efforts. The PRISMA extension facilitates the synthesis of ecological data by ensuring transparent and standardized reporting of environmental variables, spatial scales, and temporal dynamics [22]. This enables researchers to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent when analyzing data in isolation.\n\nThe combination of phylogenetic and ecological information enhances the interpretability of review findings by providing a more comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary and environmental drivers of ecological phenomena. For example, integrating phylogenetic data with species distribution models can reveal how evolutionary history influences current ecological patterns, such as species range shifts in response to climate change [18]. Similarly, incorporating ecological context into phylogenetic analyses can shed light on the evolutionary pressures that have shaped trait variation across species.\n\nDespite these benefits, the integration of phylogenetic and ecological data presents several challenges. These include the need for standardized data formats, the handling of missing or incomplete data, and the development of appropriate analytical methods that can accommodate both types of data [31]. Additionally, the interpretation of results requires a deep understanding of both evolutionary and ecological principles, which may not always be readily available within the same research team.\n\nFuture developments in the PRISMA extension should focus on improving the interoperability of phylogenetic and ecological data, enhancing methods for handling missing data, and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration. By addressing these challenges, the PRISMA extension can continue to evolve as a powerful tool for synthesizing and interpreting ecological and evolutionary research, ultimately contributing to more informed and evidence-based decision-making in conservation and environmental management.",

      "content": "Transparent reporting of statistical and analytical methods is a cornerstone of the PRISMA extension for ecology and evolutionary biology, ensuring that the findings of systematic reviews and meta-analyses are not only robust but also reproducible and interpretable. In ecological and evolutionary research, where data are often complex, heterogeneous, and influenced by multiple interacting factors, the need for detailed methodological transparency is particularly acute. The PRISMA extension mandates that researchers clearly specify the statistical models, tests, and parameters used in their analyses, as well as the software, algorithms, and computational tools employed. This not only facilitates the replication of results but also enhances the overall scientific rigor of the review process [12].\n\nOne of the critical aspects of transparent reporting is the specification of statistical models. Ecological and evolutionary meta-analyses often involve complex hierarchical or mixed-effects models, which require careful description of random and fixed effects, as well as the assumptions underlying these models. For instance, in studies involving phylogenetic data, researchers must detail how evolutionary relationships were incorporated into the analysis, whether through phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) or other phylogenetic comparative methods [12]. The PRISMA extension encourages the use of standardized reporting frameworks to ensure that such details are consistently communicated.\n\nData preprocessing and transformation are also essential components of transparent reporting. This includes handling of missing data, outliers, and data normalization, which can significantly influence the outcomes of the analysis. The PRISMA extension emphasizes the importance of documenting these steps explicitly, as they can introduce biases or affect the validity of the results. For example, studies that use imputation techniques to address missing data should report the specific methods employed, such as multiple imputation or predictive mean matching, and the impact of these techniques on the final results [12].\n\nIn addition to statistical methods, the PRISMA extension requires researchers to report the software and algorithms used for data analysis. This includes the version numbers of software packages, as well as any custom scripts or code. Such information is crucial for ensuring that the analysis can be replicated and verified by other researchers. Furthermore, the extension encourages the use of open-source tools and platforms, which promote transparency and facilitate the sharing of analytical workflows [12].\n\nThe reporting of uncertainty and variability is another key requirement. Ecological and evolutionary studies often deal with high levels of variability, and the PRISMA extension mandates that researchers present appropriate statistical measures such as confidence intervals, p-values, and effect sizes. This not only enhances the interpretability of the results but also provides a more comprehensive understanding of the data.\n\nIn conclusion, the transparent reporting of statistical and analytical methods within the PRISMA extension is essential for enhancing the reproducibility and scientific rigor of ecological and evolutionary meta-analyses. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of advanced computational tools and the adoption of more standardized reporting practices will be critical in addressing the unique challenges of ecological and evolutionary research.

This subsection outlines practical guidance for researchers and practitioners, emphasizing workflow design, tool selection, and stakeholder engagement. The goal is to support the adoption of the PRISMA extension while addressing the unique challenges of ecological and evolutionary datasets, which are often characterized by high variability, spatial-temporal complexity, and diverse data types.\n\nWorkflow design is a critical first step in implementing the PRISMA extension. Researchers should begin by defining clear research questions and study objectives, ensuring that the methodology aligns with the complexities of ecological and evolutionary data [20]. This includes specifying inclusion and exclusion criteria that account for the scale, heterogeneity, and context of the data. A well-structured workflow should also incorporate iterative refinement, allowing for adjustments as new data or insights emerge [32]. For instance, integrating phylogenetic and ecological data requires careful planning to ensure compatibility and meaningful synthesis, as highlighted in the PRISMA-ECO extension [32].\n\nTool selection is another key consideration. While traditional systematic review tools such as RevMan and Rayyan are widely used, they may not be sufficient for handling the multidimensional and spatially explicit nature of ecological and evolutionary data. Researchers should consider tools that support the integration of phylogenetic trees, species distribution models, and environmental variables, such as the R package \"metaprop\" or the \"EcoMeta\" framework [32]. Additionally, emerging technologies such as machine learning and natural language processing can enhance data extraction, annotation, and analysis, as demonstrated in studies on AI-assisted systematic reviews [25]. However, it is essential to balance innovation with methodological consistency, ensuring that the use of such tools adheres to the principles of transparency and reproducibility [32].\n\nStakeholder engagement is equally important. The PRISMA extension is not a solitary endeavor; it requires collaboration among ecologists, evolutionary biologists, data scientists, and journal editors. Engaging these stakeholders early in the process ensures that the methodology is aligned with disciplinary standards and that the resulting reviews are widely accepted and applicable. This is particularly important given the challenges of data heterogeneity and the need for domain-specific reporting standards [32]. Furthermore, involving stakeholders in the review process can enhance the credibility and impact of the findings, as noted in studies on collaborative approaches to systematic reviews [32].\n\nFinally, the implementation of the PRISMA extension must be accompanied by continuous training and capacity building. Researchers should be equipped with the necessary skills to apply the extension effectively, including an understanding of ecological data structures, statistical methods, and software tools [32]. This is especially critical for early-career researchers who may lack experience in systematic review methodologies.

For instance, a meta-analysis on the effects of climate change on species distribution employed the PRISMA extension to guide the selection and reporting of studies, ensuring a systematic and transparent approach to data aggregation and analysis [12]. This study highlighted how structured reporting criteria helped mitigate biases and improve the interpretability of findings, particularly in the context of heterogeneous ecological data.\n\nAnother notable application involved the review of evolutionary relationships among marine species, where the integration of phylogenetic data was a critical component of the PRISMA extension [12]. By explicitly incorporating phylogenetic trees and evolutionary relationships, the review provided a deeper understanding of species interactions and historical evolutionary processes. This case study underscored the importance of tailoring PRISMA guidelines to accommodate the complexity of evolutionary data, which often involves non-linear and hierarchical relationships.\n\nA third case study focused on the impact of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, where the PRISMA extension ensured the systematic inclusion of ecological data from multiple sources [12]. The structured approach enabled researchers to identify and synthesize findings from diverse studies, addressing the challenges of data variability and methodological diversity. The use of standardized reporting templates and detailed documentation of study selection criteria enhanced the reproducibility of the review, allowing for independent verification of results.\n\nIn addition, a review of plant-pollinator interactions demonstrated how the PRISMA extension could standardize reporting across diverse datasets, which is essential in ecological studies where data collection methods and metrics often vary widely [12]. The study emphasized the role of the PRISMA extension in improving the clarity and completeness of reporting, which is crucial for ensuring the reliability of meta-analytical findings.\n\nThese case studies collectively illustrate how the PRISMA extension addresses the unique challenges of ecological and evolutionary research, such as data heterogeneity, complex relationships, and the need for domain-specific reporting standards. However, they also highlight ongoing challenges, such as the need for further refinement of guidelines to accommodate evolving research methodologies and data types.

Unlike traditional systematic reviews that often focus on a single study type or data source, the PRISMA extension for ecology and evolution is designed to integrate multi-source, multi-scale, and multi-modal data, enabling more comprehensive and robust meta-analyses [12]. This subsection examines how the PRISMA extension facilitates the synthesis of such datasets, emphasizing methodological adaptations, challenges, and emerging best practices.\n\nA critical aspect of this synthesis is the integration of phylogenetic, ecological, and environmental data within the PRISMA framework. For instance, the PRISMA-ECO extension has been instrumental in ensuring that evolutionary relationships and ecological contexts are systematically considered, allowing for deeper insights into species interactions and adaptive processes [12]. By incorporating phylogenetic trees and environmental variables, researchers can better account for the hierarchical and interconnected nature of ecological systems, thereby reducing biases that may arise from overlooking evolutionary history [12]. This is particularly important in studies of biodiversity and species distribution, where the interplay between genetic and environmental factors is central to understanding ecological dynamics [15].\n\nThe PRISMA extension also addresses the challenge of synthesizing datasets with varying levels of detail, resolution, and quality. For example, in the context of long-term ecological monitoring, the PRISMA framework has been applied to standardize the inclusion of data from field surveys, remote sensing, and laboratory experiments, ensuring that findings are comparable across studies [12]. Techniques such as spatial cross-validation and feature selection are increasingly being used to mitigate the effects of spatial autocorrelation and high-dimensional data, which are common in ecological datasets [14]. These strategies not only improve the reliability of predictions but also enhance the interpretability of results, making the synthesis of diverse datasets more effective [12].\n\nHowever, the synthesis of ecological and evolutionary data using PRISMA is not without challenges. One key limitation is the variability in data formats and metadata standards, which complicates the aggregation and comparison of findings across studies [12]. Moreover, the dynamic and context-dependent nature of ecological systems necessitates flexible and iterative review approaches, which are not always fully captured by static PRISMA guidelines [33].

      "content": "The comparative analysis of traditional systematic review methods and those employing the PRISMA extension reveals significant differences in structure, transparency, and applicability, particularly within ecological and evolutionary research. Traditional systematic reviews, while foundational, often lack the specificity required to address the complex, multivariate nature of ecological and evolutionary data. These methods typically follow a linear, hypothesis-driven approach that may not fully capture the dynamic interactions and hierarchical structures inherent in ecological systems. In contrast, the PRISMA extension introduces domain-specific criteria that enhance the rigor and reproducibility of reviews in these fields, as evidenced by its integration of phylogenetic, spatial, and environmental data [34; 35]. This tailored approach allows for more nuanced inclusion of studies, ensuring that the heterogeneity of ecological datasets is appropriately addressed, a challenge that traditional methods often fail to overcome [36].\n\nOne key advantage of the PRISMA extension is its emphasis on transparent reporting and standardized methodologies, which reduces ambiguity in study selection and data extraction. Traditional approaches often suffer from inconsistencies in the application of inclusion criteria, leading to potential biases and reduced generalizability [37]. The PRISMA framework, by contrast, offers a structured checklist that guides researchers through the review process, ensuring that critical elements such as study design, data collection, and statistical analysis are consistently reported [38]. This not only improves the reliability of findings but also facilitates replication and meta-analysis, which are essential for advancing ecological and evolutionary science.\n\nMoreover, the PRISMA extension enhances the integration of qualitative and quantitative data, a critical feature in ecological and evolutionary reviews that often involve diverse data types. Traditional methods tend to prioritize quantitative outcomes, potentially overlooking the contextual and interpretive insights provided by qualitative data. The PRISMA framework addresses this gap by promoting a more holistic synthesis of findings, as demonstrated in case studies that integrate phylogenetic relationships with ecological niche models [39]. This is particularly valuable in evolutionary studies, where the interplay between genetic variation, environmental pressures, and historical processes is central to understanding adaptation and speciation.\n\nDespite these advantages, the PRISMA extension is not without limitations. Its complexity can be a barrier for researchers unfamiliar with its requirements, and the need for domain-specific adaptations may delay its widespread adoption [40]. Additionally, the dynamic nature of ecological systems challenges the rigidity of PRISMA's structured approach, necessitating further refinements to accommodate evolving research paradigms. Future developments should focus on enhancing the flexibility of the PRISMA framework while maintaining its core principles of transparency and rigor.

Ecological data, often derived from field observations, remote sensing, or experimental manipulations, vary widely in structure, resolution, and scale, complicating the synthesis of findings [34]. Similarly, evolutionary data, including genetic sequences, phylogenetic trees, and comparative genomic data, introduce additional layers of complexity due to their high dimensionality and the need for specialized analytical approaches [5]. This variability not only complicates the standardization of reporting but also challenges the application of uniform statistical and analytical methods, leading to inconsistencies in the interpretation of results.\n\nOne of the primary challenges is the lack of standardized data formats and metadata structures in ecological studies, which hinders the aggregation and comparison of findings across different datasets. For instance, the absence of a universal metadata schema makes it difficult to harmonize data from disparate sources, such as long-term ecological monitoring programs or biodiversity surveys [42]. This lack of standardization is further exacerbated by the diversity of data types, including genetic, behavioral, and environmental data, which require different handling and integration strategies [22]. Moreover, the presence of missing or incomplete data in many ecological studies poses a significant barrier to the application of consistent reporting and analysis criteria, undermining the reliability of meta-analyses and systematic reviews [43].\n\nAnother critical issue is the complexity of evolutionary processes, which are often nonlinear, context-dependent, and influenced by multiple interacting factors. Traditional systematic review frameworks, such as PRISMA, may not adequately capture the dynamic and multifaceted nature of evolutionary mechanisms, leading to gaps in the representation of findings [36]. The lack of a unified terminology for evolutionary processes further complicates the accurate and consistent reporting of results, as different studies may use varying definitions and classifications for similar phenomena [5]. This fragmentation not only affects the reproducibility of findings but also limits the generalizability of conclusions across studies.\n\nDespite these challenges, emerging approaches such as the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence are showing promise in addressing some of the integration issues. These technologies can automate data annotation, detect and correct inconsistencies, and enhance the reproducibility of systematic reviews [44]. However, the effective implementation of these solutions requires further development of domain-specific tools and frameworks that can accommodate the unique characteristics of ecological and evolutionary data.\n\nIn conclusion, the heterogeneity and complexity of ecological and evolutionary data present significant challenges for the PRISMA extension.

This complexity introduces critical reporting gaps, as traditional PRISMA structures struggle to accommodate the multifaceted nature of evolutionary mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer, speciation, and adaptation over time [12]. These processes are inherently iterative and context-sensitive, often requiring flexible and adaptive reporting frameworks that are not fully supported by current PRISMA guidelines.\n\nOne of the primary limitations is the lack of a unified terminology for evolutionary mechanisms and outcomes, which complicates consistent reporting across studies [12]. For instance, the same evolutionary phenomenon can be described using different terms depending on the disciplinary background of the researchers, leading to inconsistencies in systematic reviews. Furthermore, the dynamic and time-dependent nature of evolutionary processes is often underrepresented in PRISMA guidelines, limiting their applicability to longitudinal or comparative studies. This is particularly problematic in fields like evolutionary genetics, where the interplay between environmental pressures and genetic variation is central to understanding adaptation and diversification [12].\n\nAnother critical gap lies in the integration of phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships into the PRISMA framework. While phylogenetic data are increasingly recognized as essential for evolutionary research, their inclusion in systematic reviews remains inconsistent and often inadequate. The current PRISMA extension provides limited guidance on how to incorporate these data, leading to incomplete or misleading conclusions in meta-analyses [12]. This is exacerbated by the heterogeneity of phylogenetic data formats and the lack of standardized protocols for their analysis and interpretation [12].\n\nIn addition, the PRISMA extension has not fully addressed the multidisciplinary nature of evolutionary research, which often involves integrating data from genetics, ecology, and environmental science. This interdisciplinary complexity requires reporting standards that are both flexible and rigorous, yet the current PRISMA guidelines are largely tailored to single-discipline applications. The result is a lack of comprehensive coverage of the diverse data types and methodological approaches that characterize modern evolutionary research [12].\n\nTo address these limitations, future refinements of the PRISMA extension should prioritize the development of domain-specific adaptations that better reflect the dynamic and context-dependent nature of evolutionary processes. This includes the incorporation of more flexible reporting structures, standardized terminology for evolutionary mechanisms, and enhanced guidance for the integration of phylogenetic and ecological data. Additionally, the PRISMA extension must evolve to support interdisciplinary research by incorporating diverse data types and methodological approaches. These improvements will not only enhance the accuracy and reliability of systematic reviews in evolutionary biology but also support the broader goals of reproducibility and transparency in ecological and evolutionary research [12].",

      "content": "The implementation and adoption of the PRISMA extension in ecological and evolutionary research face a range of practical and cultural barriers that hinder its widespread use. These challenges stem from both the complexity of ecological and evolutionary data and the institutional and methodological inertia within the research community. One significant barrier is the limited awareness and training in the PRISMA extension among ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Many researchers are unfamiliar with the framework's nuances and may lack the necessary skills to apply it effectively, particularly in the context of complex, multi-dimensional datasets [13]. This lack of training is compounded by the fact that the PRISMA extension, while designed to improve transparency and rigor, introduces additional layers of methodological complexity that can be intimidating for researchers accustomed to more flexible or traditional reporting practices.\n\nInstitutional and funding structures also pose substantial obstacles to the adoption of the PRISMA extension. Many journals and funding agencies have not yet mandated the use of PRISMA for ecological and evolutionary studies, and when they do, the guidelines are often not sufficiently tailored to the specific needs of these disciplines. This lack of institutional support reduces the incentive for researchers to adopt the PRISMA extension, as it can be perceived as an additional burden rather than a valuable tool for improving research quality [13]. Furthermore, the complexity of the PRISMA extension for ecological contexts may deter researchers from using it, especially those without specialized training or support [13]. The extension requires careful attention to the reporting of phylogenetic and ecological data, as well as the integration of diverse data types, which can be challenging for researchers who are not familiar with these requirements.\n\nAnother critical barrier is the incompatibility of the PRISMA extension with existing software tools and workflows in ecological research. Many researchers rely on specialized software for data analysis and visualization, and the integration of PRISMA guidelines into these tools is often lacking or poorly supported. This can lead to inconsistencies in how studies are reported and analyzed, undermining the very transparency and reproducibility that the PRISMA extension aims to achieve [13]. Additionally, the rapid development of new methods and technologies in ecological research creates a challenge for PRISMA guidelines to remain current and relevant over time [13].\n\nDespite these challenges, there are emerging trends and opportunities for addressing these barriers. For instance, the growing emphasis on open science and data transparency has the potential to promote the adoption of the PRISMA extension by highlighting its role in improving the reproducibility of ecological and evolutionary research [12]. Moreover, the development of new tools and platforms that support PRISMA-compliant workflows could help bridge the gap between the extension's requirements and the practical needs of researchers. As the field continues to evolve, ongoing efforts to refine and adapt the PRISMA extension will be essential to ensuring its effective implementation and broader adoption.",

      "content": "The application of the PRISMA extension in ecological and evolutionary research faces significant challenges due to the dynamic and context-dependent nature of the field. While PRISMA provides a structured framework for reporting systematic reviews, its static nature often fails to accommodate the evolving methodologies and interdisciplinary complexities inherent in ecological and evolutionary studies. Ecological systems are characterized by high variability, non-linear interactions, and temporal and spatial heterogeneity, which necessitate flexible and adaptive reporting standards that can evolve with the research landscape [12]. Similarly, evolutionary processes involve intricate mechanisms such as gene flow, genetic drift, and speciation, which are not always amenable to the hierarchical and linear structures of traditional reporting guidelines [14].\n\nA key limitation of current PRISMA extensions is their insufficient integration of interdisciplinary approaches, which are increasingly essential in ecological and evolutionary research. Ecological studies often incorporate data from genetics, environmental science, and computational modeling, yet the PRISMA extension may not fully capture the multifaceted nature of these integrated datasets [12]. This limitation is further exacerbated by the lack of a unified terminology for evolutionary mechanisms, making it difficult to consistently report findings across studies [14]. Moreover, the rapid development of new methods and technologies in ecological research creates a challenge for PRISMA guidelines to remain current and relevant over time, as they are often developed based on prior research paradigms [12].\n\nAnother critical issue is the lack of domain-specific adaptations that could enhance the applicability of PRISMA in ecological and evolutionary contexts. While PRISMA provides a general framework for systematic reviews, it may not account for the unique challenges posed by ecological data, such as missing or incomplete datasets, inconsistent metadata standards, and the need for specialized statistical approaches [13]. For instance, the integration of phylogenetic information and evolutionary relationships is often inadequate in current PRISMA guidelines, leading to incomplete or misleading conclusions in meta-analyses [14].\n\nIn addition, the rapid evolution of ecological research methods and the increasing use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in data analysis further challenge the static nature of PRISMA guidelines. As new analytical techniques emerge, the PRISMA extension must adapt to ensure that these methods are appropriately reported and evaluated [12]. This requires a continuous process of refinement and updating to reflect the latest scientific advancements and methodological innovations in ecological and evolutionary research.\n\nTo address these limitations, future developments of the PRISMA extension should prioritize flexibility, interdisciplinary integration, and continuous adaptation. This includes the incorporation of domain-specific reporting standards, the development of dynamic templates that can evolve with research practices, and the integration of advanced analytical methods to enhance the accuracy and reliability of ecological and evolutionary systematic reviews [14].

These tools range from data curation platforms to computational frameworks that support statistical and phylogenetic analysis, each contributing to the reproducibility and transparency required in ecological and evolutionary research. A growing number of tools have been developed to address the unique challenges of managing complex, heterogeneous, and spatially structured data, aligning with the evolving needs of the PRISMA extension [12; 33; 14].\n\nOne class of tools focuses on structured data entry and metadata creation, offering form-based survey platforms that enforce PRISMA-compliant reporting standards. These platforms ensure that ecological and evolutionary data are collected in a consistent and standardized manner, facilitating integration across studies. For instance, tools like MODULAR [12] provide automated calculation of modularity in ecological networks, supporting the structured analysis of ecological interactions. Similarly, software such as ToxTrac [33] enables high-speed tracking of organisms, capturing behavioral data in a format that aligns with the PRISMA extension's emphasis on transparency and replicability.\n\nIn addition to data collection, computational frameworks have been developed to support the analysis of ecological and evolutionary datasets under PRISMA guidelines. These frameworks integrate statistical, phylogenetic, and ecological modeling capabilities, enabling researchers to adhere to PRISMA principles throughout the review process. For example, phyloDB and other graph-based systems facilitate large-scale phylogenetic analysis, ensuring that evolutionary relationships are accurately represented in systematic reviews [14]. Cloud-based and distributed computing environments further enhance the scalability and reproducibility of ecological meta-analyses, as seen in the application of workflow automation systems and version-controlled analysis pipelines [33].\n\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly being integrated into PRISMA extension workflows to automate data processing, improve model interpretability, and enhance the reproducibility of systematic reviews. Tools such as EvoGrader [27] leverage machine learning to analyze evolutionary explanations, while natural language processing (NLP) techniques are being used to extract and standardize key information from ecological literature [14]. These innovations not only streamline data management but also address the challenges of handling high-dimensional and multivariate ecological datasets.\n\nLooking ahead, the continued development of software tools that align with PRISMA guidelines will be critical for advancing the rigor and transparency of ecological and evolutionary research.

These frameworks integrate statistical, phylogenetic, and ecological analysis tools, providing researchers with the infrastructure needed to adhere to PRISMA guidelines while addressing the unique challenges of ecological and evolutionary data. A key component of these frameworks is the ability to manage and analyze large, heterogeneous datasets, including phylogenetic trees, species distribution models, and environmental variables, which are central to the PRISMA extension in these domains [18]. For instance, tools like phyloDB and other graph-based systems enable the integration of phylogenetic data into systematic review workflows, facilitating the analysis of evolutionary relationships and enhancing the interpretability of review findings [18].\n\nIntegrated analysis platforms that combine statistical, phylogenetic, and ecological modeling capabilities are also gaining traction. These platforms ensure consistent application of PRISMA principles by offering tools for hypothesis testing, model selection, and data visualization. Cloud-based and distributed computing environments further enhance the scalability and reproducibility of ecological meta-analyses, allowing researchers to handle large datasets and perform complex analyses efficiently [45]. For example, workflow automation systems and version-controlled analysis pipelines have been shown to improve the reproducibility of ecological meta-analyses, making it easier to track and replicate results [45].\n\nThe integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) into PRISMA extension workflows is another emerging trend.

These technologies offer innovative solutions to the challenges of data heterogeneity, reproducibility, and interpretability that are inherent in systematic reviews of complex ecological and evolutionary datasets. By automating data processing, improving model transparency, and enhancing the rigor of statistical inference, ML and AI are significantly augmenting the PRISMA extension's capacity to synthesize ecological knowledge effectively.\n\nOne of the key applications of ML in PRISMA extension workflows is the automation of data annotation and classification. Machine learning models can be trained to extract and structure key information from ecological literature, such as study design, environmental variables, and species interactions, thereby streamlining the systematic review process [47]. This not only reduces the manual effort required but also increases the consistency and scalability of data collection. Moreover, AI-driven tools can detect and correct inconsistencies in datasets, improving data quality and compliance with PRISMA reporting standards [48].\n\nIn the realm of model interpretability, ML techniques such as random forests and Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) have been shown to outperform traditional statistical models in predicting species interactions and ecological outcomes [19]. These models provide deeper insights into the relationships between ecological variables, enabling researchers to identify causally relevant trait-matching combinations. Furthermore, the integration of natural language processing (NLP) allows for the extraction of structured ecological data from unstructured text, enhancing the accuracy and completeness of systematic reviews [49].\n\nThe use of ML in PRISMA workflows also addresses the issue of reproducibility by enabling the development of robust, transparent analytical pipelines. For instance, the use of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) with missingness incorporated into attributes has been shown to produce more reliable predictions than traditional imputation methods [50]. Similarly, the adoption of spatial cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning strategies has improved the reliability of predictive models in ecological studies [2].\n\nDespite these advancements, the integration of ML and AI into PRISMA extension workflows is not without challenges. Issues such as model overfitting, data bias, and the need for domain-specific adaptation remain significant barriers. Additionally, the interpretability of complex ML models can sometimes be limited, raising concerns about their applicability in ecologically sensitive contexts [51].\n\nLooking ahead, the future of ML and AI in the PRISMA extension lies in the development of more interpretable, scalable, and domain-aware models. Advances in causal inference and explainable AI will be crucial in ensuring that ML-driven insights are both scientifically valid and actionable.

By enabling real-time collaboration and shared access to analysis tools, they enhance the efficiency and reproducibility of systematic reviews, aligning with the principles of open science and open data [12].\n\nOne of the key benefits of cloud-based platforms is their ability to support distributed data collection and storage, which is critical for large-scale ecological and evolutionary studies. Platforms such as Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, and Azure provide robust infrastructure for managing vast datasets, ensuring data integrity, and facilitating secure sharing among research teams [12]. Additionally, cloud platforms often integrate with version control systems like GitHub, which is crucial for tracking changes in data and code, ensuring traceability, and promoting reproducibility [12].\n\nCollaborative platforms such as Overleaf, RStudio Cloud, and JupyterHub have also gained traction in ecological research, as they allow multiple researchers to work on the same project simultaneously. Overleaf, for example, enables real-time editing of LaTeX documents, which is particularly useful for preparing manuscripts that adhere to PRISMA extension guidelines [12]. Similarly, JupyterHub supports interactive data analysis and visualization, making it ideal for integrating ecological and phylogenetic data into systematic reviews [13].\n\nIn addition to facilitating collaboration, these platforms often incorporate tools for automated data processing and analysis.

This survey has demonstrated that the adaptation of PRISMA to ecological and evolutionary contexts is not merely a procedural adjustment, but a necessary evolution to address the unique complexities and heterogeneity of ecological and evolutionary data. By incorporating phylogenetic, spatial, and temporal dimensions, the PRISMA extension facilitates more accurate and contextually relevant synthesis of evidence, thereby enhancing the reliability and reproducibility of ecological and evolutionary research [14]. The integration of domain-specific data types, such as species distribution models and environmental variables, underscores the adaptability of the PRISMA framework to the multidimensional nature of ecological studies [12].\n\nDespite its benefits, the application of the PRISMA extension in ecological and evolutionary research faces several challenges. Data heterogeneity, variability in study designs, and the difficulty of standardizing reporting practices across diverse datasets remain persistent obstacles [14]. Furthermore, the dynamic and often non-linear nature of evolutionary processes poses a challenge for the structured, linear reporting format of PRISMA, highlighting the need for continuous refinement and flexibility [12]. The survey also identified a gap in the adoption of the PRISMA extension, with many researchers lacking the necessary training and tools to implement it effectively [12].\n\nFuture research should focus on addressing these challenges through the development of more robust tools and training programs tailored to ecological and evolutionary contexts. Advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence offer promising avenues for automating and streamlining parts of the systematic review process, such as study selection, data extraction, and meta-analysis [14]. Additionally, there is a need for a more unified approach to data sharing and metadata standardization to improve the accessibility and reusability of ecological datasets [12]. The integration of PRISMA with emerging frameworks, such as the ECO-CHECK and PRISMA-PE, could further enhance the applicability of the extension in ecological and environmental research [12].\n\nIn conclusion, the PRISMA extension has the potential to significantly enhance the quality and transparency of systematic reviews in ecology and evolutionary biology. However, its full potential can only be realized through continued methodological innovation, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the development of supportive tools and training programs.
