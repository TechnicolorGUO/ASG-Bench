Their high surface-to-volume ratio, quantum confinement effects, and tunable surface chemistry endow them with extraordinary optical, electronic, and biological behaviors, which have been harnessed for a wide range of biomedical applications [1]. The transformative potential of nanoparticles is underscored by their ability to enhance diagnostic accuracy, enable targeted therapeutic interventions, and improve drug delivery efficiency, making them indispensable in advancing clinical outcomes [1]. As the field of nanomedicine continues to evolve, the need for accurate and systematic classification of nanoparticles has become increasingly critical to ensure their effective and safe use in medical contexts.\n\nThe classification of nanoparticles is a multidimensional task that involves the analysis of their size, shape, surface chemistry, and functional properties. Traditional classification methods rely on physical and chemical characterization techniques such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and spectroscopic analyses to determine these properties [1]. However, the complexity and variability of nanoparticle systems necessitate more sophisticated and standardized approaches to classification. Recent advances in machine learning and data-driven methodologies have introduced automated and scalable solutions for nanoparticle classification, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of these processes [1]. These developments are particularly relevant as the demand for high-throughput nanoparticle analysis grows, driven by applications in drug delivery, imaging, and biosensing.\n\nThe significance of nanoparticle classification extends beyond technical considerations, as it directly influences the design, efficacy, and safety of nanoparticle-based medical applications. For instance, the size and surface charge of nanoparticles can affect their biodistribution and cellular uptake, while their chemical composition determines their stability and biocompatibility [1]. A systematic classification framework allows researchers to tailor nanoparticles for specific medical applications, optimizing their performance in targeted drug delivery, imaging, and therapeutic interventions. Moreover, the integration of computational models and big data analytics into nanoparticle classification has opened new avenues for predicting nanoparticle behavior and improving their design [2].\n\nAs the field of nanoparticle research continues to expand, the challenges associated with their classification and application in medicine remain complex and multifaceted. Issues such as nanoparticle aggregation, long-term stability, and potential toxicity underscore the need for rigorous and standardized classification protocols [3]. Emerging trends in nanoparticle synthesis and characterization, including the use of green synthesis methods and advanced imaging techniques, further highlight the dynamic nature of this field [1]. By addressing these challenges and leveraging innovative classification strategies, researchers can unlock the full potential of nanoparticles in transforming medical diagnostics and therapeutics.",

      "content": "Nanoparticle classification based on size, shape, and morphology is a fundamental aspect of nanotechnology, as these properties significantly influence the physicochemical behavior, stability, and biological interactions of nanoparticles. Accurate characterization of these parameters enables the design and optimization of nanoparticles for specific biomedical applications, such as drug delivery, imaging, and therapy. Traditional methods for size analysis include dynamic light scattering (DLS), which provides average hydrodynamic diameters but lacks resolution for heterogeneous samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) offer high-resolution imaging, allowing precise size and shape determination, though they require extensive sample preparation and are often limited to static observations [1; 4; 5]. In recent years, advances in computational modeling and machine learning have significantly enhanced the accuracy and throughput of morphological classification, enabling automated analysis of large-scale datasets [3; 4; 2].\n\nSize distribution analysis remains a cornerstone of nanoparticle classification, with DLS being widely used for its simplicity and speed. However, DLS is susceptible to aggregation effects and cannot distinguish between different particle shapes. Alternative methods such as centrifugal sedimentation and field-flow fractionation provide more detailed size distribution information but are often more complex and costly. TEM and SEM, on the other hand, enable direct visualization of nanoparticles, allowing for the identification of irregularities and structural variations. These techniques are particularly valuable for assessing the uniformity of nanoparticles, which is crucial for applications requiring precise control over particle dimensions [3; 1; 6].\n\nShape and morphology classification is equally important, as the geometric properties of nanoparticles significantly affect their functional behavior. For instance, rod-shaped or spherical nanoparticles may exhibit different cellular uptake efficiencies and biodistribution profiles. SEM and TEM are the primary tools for shape analysis, but they are limited in throughput and require skilled operators for image interpretation. Recent advances in machine learning have introduced automated shape recognition algorithms, such as U-Net and convolutional neural networks, which can classify nanoparticle shapes with high accuracy from large image datasets [4; 5; 2]. These approaches not only improve classification speed but also reduce subjectivity in image analysis, making them highly valuable for high-throughput screening and quality control.\n\nMorphological pattern recognition has also benefited from the integration of computational modeling and data-driven approaches. Techniques such as Hough transforms and starlet wavelet-based segmentation have been employed to extract key morphological features from nanoparticle images, enabling detailed classification and comparison. Additionally, recent studies have demonstrated the utility of deep learning in predicting nanoparticle morphology from spectroscopic and diffraction data, offering a more holistic approach to classification [4; 5]. As the field continues to evolve, the development of more sophisticated and robust classification methods will remain critical for advancing nanoparticle research in medicine.",

      "content": "The classification of nanoparticles based on their chemical composition and surface functionalization is a critical aspect of nanoparticle characterization, as these properties fundamentally influence their stability, reactivity, and bioavailability. Chemical composition refers to the elemental and molecular makeup of the nanoparticle, while surface functionalization involves the attachment of specific ligands, polymers, or biomolecules that can modulate interactions with biological systems. These characteristics are essential for determining the applicability of nanoparticles in biomedical contexts, such as drug delivery, imaging, and diagnostics. Advanced analytical techniques, including spectroscopy and elemental mapping, are indispensable for accurately determining these properties and classifying nanoparticles according to their chemical and surface attributes [3].\n\nSpectroscopic techniques such as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are widely used for analyzing the elemental and molecular composition of nanoparticles. EDS, for instance, provides elemental identification by detecting characteristic X-ray emissions from the sample, while FTIR spectroscopy reveals the presence of functional groups by measuring the absorption of infrared radiation [1]. XPS, on the other hand, offers surface-sensitive chemical analysis by probing the valence and core levels of the elements present on the nanoparticle surface, enabling the identification of oxidation states and chemical bonding [7]. These techniques collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of the chemical composition of nanoparticles, facilitating their classification and optimization for specific applications.\n\nSurface functionalization is a key parameter in nanoparticle classification, as it determines the colloidal stability, targeting efficiency, and biocompatibility of the nanoparticles. Functionalization strategies involve the attachment of ligands, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), antibodies, or peptides, which can enhance the circulation time of nanoparticles in the bloodstream and enable targeted delivery to specific cells or tissues. Techniques such as zeta potential measurements, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and fluorescent labeling are used to assess the effectiveness of surface modifications [1]. Zeta potential analysis, for example, measures the surface charge of nanoparticles, which is crucial for understanding their electrostatic interactions and stability in suspension [1]. SPR and fluorescent labeling, on the other hand, allow for real-time monitoring of ligand-receptor interactions and the spatial distribution of surface-bound molecules [1].\n\nIn addition to spectroscopy and surface analysis, techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are employed to evaluate the chemical stability and reactivity of nanoparticles. TGA measures the mass change of a sample as a function of temperature, providing insights into thermal decomposition and stability, while DSC measures the heat flow associated with phase transitions and chemical reactions [1]. These methods are particularly useful for assessing the long-term stability of nanoparticles under various environmental conditions.\n\nEmerging trends in nanoparticle classification emphasize the integration of machine learning and data-driven approaches to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of chemical and surface characterization. Techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and principal component analysis (PCA) are being used to analyze large datasets of spectroscopic and surface characteristics, enabling the automated classification of nanoparticles based on their chemical and surface properties [1; 8]. These advancements not only improve the precision of nanoparticle classification but also facilitate the development of novel nanomaterials with tailored functionalities for biomedical applications. This classification approach complements the functional and morphological categorizations discussed in the previous and following subsections, offering a more holistic understanding of nanoparticle behavior in medical applications.",

This functional classification provides a framework for understanding how nanoparticles are engineered to meet the specific demands of diagnostic, therapeutic, and delivery-oriented tasks. The primary categories include imaging and diagnostic agents, drug delivery systems, therapeutic agents, and biosensors, each of which requires distinct physicochemical properties and design strategies [1].\n\nImaging and diagnostic nanoparticles are primarily designed to enhance contrast and resolution in various imaging modalities. For example, quantum dots (QDs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are widely used in fluorescence and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for high-resolution molecular imaging [1]. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are particularly effective in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to their ability to alter the magnetic properties of surrounding tissues, improving image contrast [1]. These particles often require specific surface functionalization to ensure biocompatibility and targeted accumulation in the desired biological environment [1].\n\nIn the realm of drug delivery, nanoparticles are engineered to encapsulate, protect, and deliver therapeutic agents with high precision. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymeric nanoparticles, and inorganic nanoparticles such as silica or iron oxide-based particles are commonly employed for this purpose. The functional classification of drug delivery nanoparticles takes into account factors such as biocompatibility, stability, surface charge, and targeting efficiency. Stimuli-responsive nanoparticles, which release their cargo in response to pH, temperature, or enzymatic triggers, are particularly effective in achieving site-specific drug delivery, reducing systemic toxicity [1].\n\nTherapeutic nanoparticles extend the functional classification to include mechanisms such as photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, gene delivery, and immunotherapy. Gold nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and semiconductor quantum dots are often used for photothermal and photodynamic applications due to their ability to generate heat or reactive oxygen species upon light irradiation [2]. In gene therapy, lipid-based nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles have been extensively studied for their ability to deliver genetic material such as mRNA or siRNA with high efficiency [3].\n\nBiosensors represent another crucial category of functional nanoparticles, where the particles are designed to detect biomarkers or disease-related molecules with high sensitivity and specificity. These biosensors often rely on the unique optical, electrical, or magnetic properties of nanoparticles to enhance signal detection [1]. The integration of machine learning and data-driven models further enhances the accuracy and reliability of nanoparticle-based biosensors, enabling real-time monitoring and early disease detection [3].\n\nEmerging trends in functional classification emphasize the development of multifunctional nanoparticles that combine imaging, drug delivery, and therapeutic capabilities in a single system. These \"theranostic\" nanoparticles represent a paradigm shift in personalized medicine, allowing for simultaneous diagnosis and treatment. However, challenges such as biocompatibility, long-term stability, and regulatory approval remain significant barriers to clinical translation [9].\n\nIn conclusion, functional classification based on medical applications provides a critical lens through which nanoparticles can be designed, optimized, and utilized for specific clinical needs. As the field continues to evolve, integrating advanced characterization techniques and machine learning algorithms will be essential in refining these classifications and improving the efficacy of nanoparticle-based medical technologies.",

Traditional methods of nanoparticle classification, while effective, often rely on manual interpretation and are limited by their scalability and reproducibility. In contrast, ML and data-driven approaches offer automated, efficient, and interpretable solutions that can handle the complexity and heterogeneity of nanoparticle data. These models are particularly valuable in analyzing large-scale datasets derived from imaging, spectroscopy, and other advanced characterization techniques, enabling the identification of subtle patterns and features that may be difficult to discern through conventional means [1].\n\nOne of the key applications of ML in nanoparticle classification is the automated analysis of imaging data, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as U-Net, have been successfully employed to segment nanoparticle images and classify them based on size, shape, and morphology [1]. These deep learning models can learn complex features from raw image data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering and improving classification accuracy. For instance, in a study by [1], a CNN-based model achieved a classification accuracy of 96.85% for Alzheimer's disease using functional MRI data, demonstrating the potential of deep learning in biomedical applications, which can be extended to nanoparticle classification.\n\nAnother critical aspect of data-driven approaches is feature engineering and dimensionality reduction. Techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and autoencoders are used to extract meaningful features from high-dimensional nanoparticle data. These methods not only improve classification performance but also reduce computational complexity, making it feasible to analyze large-scale datasets [1]. For example, in a study focused on the classification of anticancer peptides, a kernel sparse representation classifier was employed, which outperformed traditional black-box methods by leveraging the structure of amino acid pairs and using an efficient matching pursuit solver [1].\n\nPredictive modeling is another essential application of ML in nanoparticle classification. Machine learning models such as random forests, support vector machines (SVMs), and neural networks are used to predict nanoparticle behavior, including toxicity, aggregation, and stability, based on their physicochemical properties [2]. These models can be trained on large datasets that integrate multiple sources of information, such as spectroscopic data, chemical composition, and morphological features, enabling the development of more accurate and reliable classification systems.\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain. The integration of heterogeneous data from various characterization techniques requires standardized datasets and robust validation protocols. Additionally, the interpretability of ML models, particularly deep learning, remains a concern, as their \"black-box\" nature can limit their adoption in clinical and regulatory settings. Addressing these challenges will require further research into explainable AI and the development of more transparent and interpretable models.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of machine learning and data-driven models into nanoparticle classification is revolutionizing the field, offering unprecedented accuracy, scalability, and efficiency. As the field continues to evolve, the development of more robust, interpretable, and generalizable models will be essential for advancing the application of nanoparticles in medicine.",

These traditional methods remain indispensable for producing nanoparticles with tailored characteristics for biomedical, catalytic, and electronic applications. Among the most widely employed approaches are sol-gel synthesis, precipitation methods, electrospinning, and vapor-phase deposition techniques, each with distinct mechanisms, advantages, and limitations.\n\nSol-gel synthesis, for instance, is a versatile chemical process that involves the formation of a colloidal suspension (sol) that evolves into a gel, followed by drying and heat treatment to produce nanoparticles [3]. This method is particularly effective for oxide-based nanoparticles, such as silica and titanium dioxide, offering high purity and homogeneity. However, it often requires careful control of pH, temperature, and precursor concentrations to achieve the desired particle morphology, as variations in these parameters can lead to undesirable aggregation or non-uniform particle size distribution [3]. The ability to control the microstructure of the final product makes sol-gel synthesis suitable for applications ranging from drug delivery to optical devices.\n\nPrecipitation methods, including co-precipitation and reverse micelle techniques, are another group of chemical approaches that enable the synthesis of nanoparticles with controlled size and shape. Co-precipitation involves the simultaneous precipitation of multiple components, often metals or metal oxides, from a solution under specific conditions [1]. This method is straightforward and cost-effective, making it suitable for large-scale production. However, achieving precise control over particle size and morphology can be challenging, as the kinetics of nucleation and growth are highly dependent on the reaction environment. Reverse micelle techniques, on the other hand, utilize surfactant-based microemulsions to encapsulate precursor molecules, creating a confined environment for nanoparticle formation [1]. This approach allows for better control over particle size and morphology, as the micelle size directly influences the nanoparticle size. Nevertheless, the complexity of surfactant selection and the need for subsequent purification steps can limit its scalability.\n\nElectrospinning, a physical method, is widely used for the fabrication of nanofibers and nanoparticles through the application of high-voltage electric fields. This technique is particularly effective for polymeric and composite nanoparticles, offering a straightforward way to control fiber diameter and morphology [1]. The electrospun nanofibers can be further processed into nanoparticles through techniques such as grinding or dissolution. However, electrospinning is less suitable for inorganic nanoparticles, as the high voltages involved can cause degradation or unwanted chemical reactions. Moreover, achieving uniform particle size and shape requires optimization of parameters such as voltage, solution concentration, and collector distance.\n\nVapor-phase deposition techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and physical vapor deposition (PVD), are physical methods that enable the synthesis of nanoparticles with high crystallinity and precise control over size and shape. These techniques are commonly used for the production of carbon nanotubes, metal nanoparticles, and semiconductor nanowires [1]. CVD involves the reaction of gaseous precursors on a substrate, while PVD relies on the condensation of vaporized materials. Both methods offer excellent control over nanoparticle morphology but are typically more complex and expensive compared to chemical methods. Additionally, the high temperatures and vacuum conditions required for these processes can limit their applicability to certain materials.\n\nEmerging trends in nanoparticle synthesis are increasingly focused on improving scalability, reducing environmental impact, and enhancing functional properties. For instance, the integration of machine learning and data-driven optimization is being explored to refine synthesis parameters and predict nanoparticle behavior [1]. These advancements, coupled with the development of green synthesis methods, are expected to drive the next generation of nanoparticle fabrication techniques, addressing the current limitations of traditional chemical and physical approaches.",

These methods leverage the natural reducing and stabilizing agents present in living organisms, such as microorganisms, plants, and biomolecules, to synthesize nanoparticles without the need for harsh chemicals or high-energy inputs. This subsection provides a critical analysis of these approaches, highlighting their advantages, challenges, and emerging trends.\n\nMicrobial synthesis is one of the most extensively studied biological methods for nanoparticle fabrication. Bacteria, fungi, and algae have been shown to reduce metal ions into nanoparticles through enzymatic reactions and biosurfactant-mediated processes [1]. For instance, *Bacillus subtilis* and *Escherichia coli* have been used to synthesize silver and gold nanoparticles, with the resulting particles exhibiting excellent stability and biocompatibility [1]. The advantage of microbial synthesis lies in its scalability and the ability to produce nanoparticles with controlled size and shape. However, this method is often limited by the slow reaction kinetics and the need for precise environmental control, which can complicate large-scale production [1].\n\nPlant-mediated synthesis offers an alternative approach that is both eco-friendly and cost-effective. Plant extracts, rich in polyphenols, flavonoids, and other reducing agents, can act as both reducing and capping agents during nanoparticle synthesis. For example, *Aloe vera* and *Neem* extracts have been used to synthesize silver and gold nanoparticles with high uniformity and stability [1]. This method is advantageous due to its simplicity, low cost, and the ability to use renewable resources. However, the variability in plant extract composition can lead to inconsistencies in nanoparticle size and morphology, necessitating rigorous standardization protocols [1].\n\nEnzyme-assisted synthesis represents another promising avenue for green nanoparticle fabrication. Enzymes such as lysozyme and peroxidase can catalyze the reduction of metal ions, enabling the synthesis of nanoparticles under mild conditions [2]. This approach is particularly appealing for applications requiring high purity and controlled nanoparticle properties. Nevertheless, the high cost of enzyme isolation and the need for specific reaction conditions can limit its widespread adoption.\n\nDespite the numerous benefits of biological and green synthesis approaches, challenges remain in terms of scalability, reproducibility, and standardization. Recent advances in synthetic biology and systems biology are beginning to address these issues by enabling the engineering of microorganisms and plants to produce nanoparticles with enhanced properties [3]. Furthermore, the integration of machine learning and data-driven models is being explored to optimize synthesis parameters and predict nanoparticle behavior [1].

Among the most prominent methods are lithography, self-assembly, and 3D printing, each offering unique advantages in terms of precision, scalability, and versatility. These techniques not only allow for the fabrication of nanoparticles with defined size, shape, and composition but also facilitate the integration of complex functionalities, such as stimuli responsiveness and multifunctionality, essential for advanced therapeutic and diagnostic applications.\n\nLithography-based techniques, including electron beam lithography and photolithography, provide sub-10 nm resolution and high precision in patterning, making them ideal for creating complex nanostructures with controlled geometry. These methods rely on the use of masks and resist layers to define patterns, which are then etched or deposited to produce the desired nanostructures. However, lithography is often limited by its high cost, complexity, and the need for cleanroom environments, which can hinder its widespread use in biomedical settings [1]. Despite these challenges, recent advances in direct-write lithography and nanoimprint techniques have demonstrated potential for scalable and cost-effective nanoparticle fabrication [1].\n\nSelf-assembly, in contrast, leverages molecular interactions to spontaneously form ordered structures, offering a bottom-up approach to nanoparticle fabrication. This technique is particularly advantageous for creating uniform and monodisperse nanoparticles, as it relies on the inherent tendency of molecules to arrange themselves into stable configurations. For example, block copolymer self-assembly has been widely used to generate well-defined nanoparticle arrays with tunable size and spacing [1]. However, the lack of control over the final structure and the dependence on specific environmental conditions, such as temperature and solvent composition, present significant challenges in achieving consistent results [1].\n\n3D printing, specifically stereolithography and fused deposition modeling, has also gained traction as a promising method for fabricating three-dimensional nanoparticle-based systems. These techniques enable the creation of complex geometries and multi-functional devices, which are particularly useful in applications such as tissue engineering and lab-on-chip systems. The ability to integrate multiple materials and functionalities within a single structure further enhances the potential of 3D printing in biomedical applications [1]. Nevertheless, the resolution and precision of current 3D printing technologies remain limited compared to lithography, and the development of suitable inks and resins for nanoparticle incorporation is still an active area of research [2].\n\nEmerging trends in advanced fabrication techniques emphasize the integration of these methods with microfluidics and lab-on-chip systems, enabling precise control over nanoparticle synthesis and functionalization. The use of machine learning and data-driven approaches to optimize fabrication parameters and predict nanoparticle behavior is also gaining momentum, offering new opportunities for efficient and reproducible synthesis [3].

These techniques are essential for understanding the size, shape, and distribution of nanoparticles, which are critical factors in determining their behavior in biological systems and their effectiveness in medical applications. Among the most widely used advanced imaging methods are scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and super-resolution microscopy, each offering unique capabilities and limitations [1; 1; 1].\n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) provides high-resolution topographical images of nanoparticles, making it ideal for analyzing surface features and particle distribution. Its ability to produce detailed images with a large depth of field makes it particularly useful for studying irregularly shaped nanoparticles. However, SEM requires vacuum conditions and can be limited in its ability to provide three-dimensional information. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), on the other hand, allows for atomic-level imaging, offering insights into internal structures, crystallography, and interfacial properties. TEM is particularly valuable for studying the crystalline structure of nanoparticles, but its application is often restricted by the need for thin samples and the potential for radiation damage [1; 1].\n\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) is another powerful tool for nanoscale surface topography and mechanical property analysis. Unlike SEM and TEM, AFM can operate in liquid environments, making it suitable for in-situ studies of nanoparticles in biological systems. AFM also provides information on nanoparticle adhesion, elasticity, and interactions, which are important for understanding their behavior in complex environments. However, AFM is generally slower and less suitable for high-throughout analysis compared to other techniques [2; 3].\n\nSuper-resolution microscopy techniques, such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) and photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM), have revolutionized the field by enabling imaging beyond the diffraction limit. These techniques are particularly useful for studying sub-cellular interactions and nanoparticle behavior in living cells. While they offer exceptional resolution, their application is often limited by the need for specialized equipment and fluorescent labeling [1; 3].\n\nEmerging trends in advanced imaging include the integration of machine learning and data-driven approaches to enhance image analysis and classification. These techniques improve the accuracy and efficiency of nanoparticle analysis by automating feature extraction and pattern recognition.

These techniques leverage the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter to extract detailed information at the molecular and atomic levels, making them indispensable in nanomaterials research. Among the most widely used spectroscopic methods are Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Each of these techniques offers unique advantages and limitations, and their combined application enables a comprehensive understanding of nanoparticle properties.\n\nRaman spectroscopy is a powerful non-destructive technique that provides molecular fingerprinting by detecting inelastic scattering of monochromatic light. It is particularly sensitive to vibrational and rotational modes of molecules, making it ideal for identifying functional groups and crystallinity in nanoparticles [1]. However, Raman spectroscopy is often limited by weak signal intensity, especially for nanoparticles with low Raman cross-sections, and requires high-quality laser sources and sensitive detectors. This limitation has been addressed in part by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which utilizes plasmonic nanostructures to amplify the Raman signal by several orders of magnitude [1].\n\nIn contrast, FTIR spectroscopy offers a broader range of information on molecular bonds and functional groups by measuring the absorption of infrared radiation. It is widely used for analyzing the surface chemistry of nanoparticles, particularly those with organic or polymeric coatings [1]. Despite its high sensitivity and ease of use, FTIR is less effective for inorganic nanoparticles, which often exhibit weak or no infrared absorption. Moreover, the technique is sensitive to sample preparation, requiring the formation of thin films or KBr pellets, which may alter the native properties of nanoparticles.\n\nXRD is a cornerstone technique for determining the crystalline structure of nanoparticles, providing information on lattice parameters, crystallographic phases, and crystallite size through the analysis of diffraction patterns [1]. This method is particularly useful for assessing the degree of crystallinity and identifying phase transformations in metallic and oxide nanoparticles. However, XRD is limited in its ability to probe amorphous or nanostructured materials, and it requires well-defined crystalline samples for accurate interpretation.\n\nXPS, on the other hand, provides surface-sensitive chemical analysis by measuring the kinetic energy of electrons emitted from a material's surface upon irradiation with X-rays. It is invaluable for determining the elemental composition, oxidation states, and chemical bonding of nanoparticles, making it a critical tool in surface science and nanotechnology [1]. However, XPS has limited depth resolution, typically probing only the top few nanometers of a material, and is not suitable for analyzing bulk properties.\n\nEmerging trends in spectroscopic characterization include the integration of machine learning algorithms to enhance data interpretation and the development of advanced spectroscopic techniques such as time-resolved and hyperspectral spectroscopy.

These techniques enable the assessment of nanoparticle stability, dispersion, and interactions with biological systems, which are crucial for their safe and effective use. Among the most widely used methods are dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential analysis, which provide valuable insights into the size distribution and surface charge of nanoparticles, respectively. DLS measures the Brownian motion of particles in a liquid medium to determine their hydrodynamic size, while zeta potential analysis quantifies the electrokinetic potential at the particle surface, influencing colloidal stability. These techniques are non-invasive, relatively fast, and suitable for large-scale screening [1]. However, they have limitations, such as sensitivity to polydispersity and the inability to distinguish between aggregated and individual particles. Furthermore, DLS is less effective for particles smaller than 10 nm due to the limitations of light scattering theory [1].\n\nElectrophoretic light scattering (ELS) is another technique that measures the electrophoretic mobility of nanoparticles, which is directly related to their zeta potential. ELS provides complementary information to DLS, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of nanoparticle behavior in solution. ELS is particularly useful for analyzing charged particles and determining their stability under different environmental conditions. However, like DLS, ELS is limited in its ability to resolve complex polydisperse systems and requires careful calibration to ensure accurate results [1].\n\nCryo-transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) offers a unique advantage in characterizing nanoparticles in their native, hydrated state, preserving their structural integrity. This technique is particularly valuable for studying the dynamic behavior of nanoparticles in biological environments, as it provides high-resolution images of individual particles without the need for drying or staining. Cryo-TEM can also be used to investigate the aggregation behavior of nanoparticles and their interactions with cellular membranes. However, the technique is resource-intensive, requiring specialized equipment and expertise, and is not well-suited for high-throughput analysis [1].\n\nIn addition to these traditional methods, emerging approaches such as machine learning-based image analysis and data-driven modeling are revolutionizing nanoparticle characterization.

Furthermore, in vitro biodistribution studies using fluorescent or radiolabeled nanoparticles can simulate nanoparticle transport and accumulation in different cellular compartments, providing insights into their pharmacokinetic profiles.\n\nIn vivo evaluation, on the other hand, is more complex due to the variability and unpredictability of biological systems. Biodistribution studies often involve imaging modalities such as fluorescence, positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which allow real-time tracking of nanoparticle distribution in animal models [1]. These studies are essential for assessing nanoparticle targeting efficiency, clearance pathways, and potential off-target effects. Additionally, in vivo toxicity assessments, including histopathological, hematological, and biochemical analyses, help evaluate the long-term safety and biocompatibility of nanoparticles [2].\n\nEmerging trends in nanoparticle evaluation emphasize the integration of computational models and machine learning to predict in vivo behavior based on in vitro data. For instance, predictive toxicology models using deep learning have been developed to simulate nanoparticle interactions with biological systems and identify potential adverse effects before in vivo testing [3].

Biocompatibility refers to the ability of a material to perform with an appropriate host response in a specific application, and for nanoparticles, this involves evaluating their interactions with biological systems without eliciting adverse effects [1]. This subsection explores the methodologies and challenges in assessing how nanoparticles interact with living cells, tissues, and organs, emphasizing the importance of designing nanoparticles that can coexist safely with the human body.\n\nThe biocompatibility of nanoparticles is influenced by several factors, including their size, shape, surface chemistry, and composition. Smaller nanoparticles (typically below 100 nm) can more easily penetrate biological barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier, and may exhibit different biological behaviors compared to larger particles [1]. Size distribution analysis using techniques like dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is essential for understanding nanoparticle behavior in biological environments [1]. Additionally, surface functionalization plays a critical role in modulating nanoparticle interactions with biological systems. For example, coating nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG) can reduce nonspecific protein adsorption and prolong their circulation time in the bloodstream [1].\n\nCellular response to nanoparticle exposure includes uptake mechanisms, intracellular trafficking, and potential cytotoxic effects. Studies have shown that nanoparticles can be internalized via endocytosis, and their intracellular fate depends on factors such as surface charge and hydrophobicity [1]. In vitro studies often use assays like the MTT assay or live/dead staining to evaluate cytotoxicity, while in vivo models provide insights into long-term biocompatibility and potential organ-specific effects [2]. The assessment of inflammation and immune response is also crucial, as nanoparticles may trigger immune activation or alter immune cell function, depending on their surface properties and composition [3].\n\nRecent advances in biocompatibility assessment have integrated machine learning and computational modeling to predict nanoparticle behavior and toxicity based on physicochemical properties. These approaches can complement traditional experimental methods by providing insights into nanoparticle interactions with biological systems and reducing the need for extensive in vitro and in vivo testing [1]. However, challenges remain in standardizing biocompatibility testing protocols and ensuring that assessments are relevant to clinical settings.\n\nLooking ahead, the development of more sophisticated in vitro models, such as organ-on-a-chip systems, and the integration of high-throughput screening methods will enhance the efficiency and accuracy of biocompatibility assessments. Additionally, the use of advanced imaging and spectroscopic techniques, combined with data-driven approaches, will provide a more comprehensive understanding of nanoparticle-biological interactions.

The mechanisms of nanoparticle-induced toxicity are multifaceted, involving cellular, organ, and systemic levels. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing safe and effective nanomaterials. At the cellular level, nanoparticles can induce oxidative stress, a well-documented mechanism of toxicity, through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and DNA [17]. Oxidative stress is often exacerbated by the surface chemistry of nanoparticles, where functional groups and metal ions can catalyze ROS production, as demonstrated in studies on metallic nanoparticles [18]. Additionally, nanoparticle size and shape play a crucial role in their cellular uptake and intracellular distribution. Smaller nanoparticles, due to their high surface area-to-volume ratio, tend to penetrate cellular membranes more easily, leading to increased intracellular accumulation and potential disruption of cellular functions [19]. Another significant mechanism of nanoparticle toxicity is genotoxicity, which involves damage to genetic material. This can occur through direct interaction with DNA, leading to mutations or chromosomal abnormalities. For example, studies on carbon nanotubes have shown that their fibrous structure can mimic asbestos fibers, leading to persistent inflammation and genotoxic effects [17]. Furthermore, nanoparticles can disrupt cellular functions by altering membrane integrity and affecting signaling pathways. This disruption is often mediated by the interaction of nanoparticles with membrane lipids and proteins, leading to changes in cell viability and function [18]. At the organ level, nanoparticles can accumulate in specific tissues, leading to localized toxicity. For instance, nanoparticles that are not properly cleared from the body can accumulate in the liver and spleen, leading to organ dysfunction. In vivo studies have shown that the biodistribution and clearance of nanoparticles depend on factors such as surface charge, size, and functionalization, which can influence their toxicity profile [18]. Systemic toxicity, on the other hand, arises from the widespread distribution of nanoparticles throughout the body, potentially affecting multiple organ systems. This is particularly concerning for nanoparticles that can cross the blood-brain barrier or enter the bloodstream, leading to neurotoxicity or cardiovascular effects [17]. Recent advances in toxicity evaluation have leveraged machine learning and data-driven approaches to predict nanoparticle toxicity based on their physicochemical properties. These models, such as random forests and support vector machines, have shown promise in identifying key toxicity determinants and improving the safety assessment of nanomaterials [17]. Despite these advances, challenges remain in understanding the complex interactions between nanoparticles and biological systems. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated models that integrate multi-omics data and consider the dynamic nature of nanoparticle-biological interactions. Additionally, standardized toxicity testing protocols are needed to ensure the consistent evaluation of nanoparticle safety across different applications.

Surface modification and design optimization are central to these efforts, as they directly influence nanoparticle interactions with biological systems. A primary objective is to reduce nonspecific uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), minimize immune recognition, and prevent unintended cellular damage. These goals are achieved through a variety of surface engineering approaches, including the use of biocompatible polymers, bioactive ligands, and stealth coatings that alter surface charge and hydrophilicity. For instance, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is extensively employed to prolong nanoparticle circulation time and reduce opsonization, as demonstrated in studies utilizing PEGylated liposomes [1]. Additionally, the functionalization of nanoparticles with targeting moieties such as antibodies, peptides, or aptamers enhances specificity and reduces off-target effects, improving therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity [1].\n\nSurface modifications also play a crucial role in addressing the issue of nanoparticle aggregation, which can lead to unintended physiological outcomes. Coatings such as dextran, chitosan, and silica can stabilize nanoparticles in biological environments, preventing premature aggregation and ensuring uniform dispersion. For example, a study on silica-coated gold nanoparticles demonstrated significant improvement in colloidal stability and reduced cytotoxicity compared to uncoated counterparts [1]. Moreover, the incorporation of stimuli-responsive elements, such as pH-sensitive linkers or temperature-sensitive polymers, allows for controlled release of therapeutic agents, further enhancing safety and efficacy. These strategies are particularly relevant in drug delivery applications, where the precise spatial and temporal release of payloads is essential for optimal therapeutic outcomes [1].\n\nAnother promising approach involves the design of biodegradable nanoparticles that degrade into non-toxic byproducts within the body. Materials such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and chitosan are widely used for their tunable degradation rates and minimal residual toxicity [1]. Recent advances in machine learning have enabled the prediction of nanoparticle degradation pathways, facilitating the design of safer, more predictable nanomaterials. For instance, ML models have been trained to predict the stability and degradation profiles of nanoparticles based on their chemical composition and surface chemistry [2].

For instance, nanoparticles designed for targeted drug delivery require precise control over surface functionalization and morphology to ensure optimal interaction with biological systems [1; 2].\n\nThe medical applications of nanoparticles, particularly in diagnostics, therapeutics, and drug delivery, have been extensively explored in this survey. The development of nanoparticle-based imaging agents, such as quantum dots and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, has significantly improved the resolution and specificity of diagnostic tools, enabling early detection of diseases [1; 1]. Similarly, the use of nanoparticles in therapeutic applications, including photothermal and photodynamic therapy, has demonstrated promising results in treating cancer and other conditions [1; 1]. However, the survey also highlights the need for further research into the long-term safety and biocompatibility of nanoparticles, as well as the development of standardized protocols for their evaluation [2; 3].\n\nLooking ahead, the future of nanoparticle research lies in the integration of advanced computational models, such as machine learning and deep learning, to optimize design, classification, and performance [11; 2]. Emerging trends, such as the development of responsive and smart nanoparticles, as well as the application of nanotechnology in personalized medicine, offer exciting opportunities for innovation [3; 9]. However, these advancements must be accompanied by rigorous safety assessments and ethical considerations to ensure the responsible translation of nanoparticle-based technologies into clinical practice [2; 14]. Ultimately, the survey emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, robust standardization, and continuous innovation to fully realize the potential of nanoparticles in medicine.",
