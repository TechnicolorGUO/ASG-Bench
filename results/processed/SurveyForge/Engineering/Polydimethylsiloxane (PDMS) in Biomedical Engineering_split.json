      "content": "[1]\nPolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has emerged as a cornerstone material in biomedical engineering, owing to its unique combination of chemical stability, mechanical flexibility, and biocompatibility. Initially developed for industrial applications, PDMS has undergone a remarkable transformation, evolving into a widely adopted biomaterial that underpins a diverse array of biomedical technologies. This subsection provides a comprehensive overview of PDMS, emphasizing its chemical structure, key physical and mechanical properties, and its growing significance in biomedical applications. By contextualizing its historical development and highlighting its transition from an industrial polymer to a critical biomaterial, this section establishes the foundation for the broader survey that follows.\n\nPDMS is a silicon-based organic polymer with a repeating unit of -[2]-, which imparts it with exceptional chemical inertness and thermal stability. The silicon-oxygen backbone is inherently resistant to hydrolysis and oxidation, while the methyl groups attached to the silicon atoms contribute to its low surface energy and hydrophobicity. These properties make PDMS highly resistant to degradation in biological environments and enable it to maintain its integrity over extended periods, a critical requirement for long-term biomedical applications. Additionally, PDMS exhibits a high degree of flexibility and elasticity, allowing it to conform to complex geometries without losing structural integrity. This mechanical adaptability, combined with its transparency, makes PDMS an ideal material for applications ranging from microfluidic devices to tissue engineering scaffolds.\n\nThe historical trajectory of PDMS in biomedical engineering reflects its adaptability and versatility. Originally developed in the 1940s as a high-temperature resistant lubricant and sealant, PDMS found early applications in the aerospace and automotive industries. However, its biocompatibility and ease of fabrication soon attracted attention from the biomedical community. The 1980s and 1990s marked a pivotal shift as researchers began exploring PDMS for microfluidic systems, where its transparency and ease of soft lithography enabled the creation of intricate fluidic networks. This breakthrough catalyzed its adoption in lab-on-a-chip technologies, biosensing, and drug delivery systems, further cementing its role as a versatile platform material in biomedical engineering [3].\n\nIn recent years, PDMS has become a key component in advanced biomedical technologies, including tissue engineering, organ-on-a-chip systems, and wearable biosensors. Its ability to support cell growth and interact with biological tissues while maintaining mechanical stability has made it a preferred material for developing scaffolds and microenvironmental platforms. Moreover, its surface can be readily modified to enhance cell adhesion, control protein adsorption, and improve biocompatibility, making it highly suitable for a wide range of applications. However, despite its many advantages, PDMS also presents challenges, such as its relatively low surface energy, which can limit cell-material interactions, and its susceptibility to gas permeability, which may affect long-term device stability [3].\n\nThis survey aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of PDMS in biomedical engineering, examining its material properties, applications, and limitations. By integrating insights from recent studies and technological advancements, this work seeks to illuminate the current state of PDMS research and identify future directions for its application in biomedical systems. As the field continues to evolve, PDMS remains at the forefront of innovations, offering a robust platform for the development of next-generation biomedical devices.",

      "content": "Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a linear silicone polymer characterized by a unique chemical structure that underpins its exceptional material properties. The fundamental repeating unit of PDMS consists of a silicon-oxygen (Si–O) backbone, with two methyl groups (-CH₃) attached to each silicon atom, forming a (CH₃)₂SiO repeating unit [3]. This siloxane backbone is highly stable due to the strong Si–O bond (bond energy ≈ 452 kJ/mol) and its inherent flexibility, which arises from the rotational freedom around the Si–O bonds [3]. The Si–O bond's ability to undergo conformational changes without breaking contributes to PDMS’s low glass transition temperature (Tg ≈ -123 °C), allowing it to remain flexible even at low temperatures [3]. The presence of methyl groups further enhances the material's chemical inertness and hydrophobicity, as the methyl groups shield the Si–O backbone from reactive species and reduce surface energy [3]. These functional groups also contribute to PDMS’s low dielectric constant and its excellent electrical insulating properties, making it suitable for applications in biomedical devices and microelectronics [3].\n\nThe molecular weight of PDMS plays a critical role in determining its mechanical and physical properties. Higher molecular weight PDMS exhibits increased chain entanglement and intermolecular interactions, leading to enhanced tensile strength and elasticity [4]. However, excessively high molecular weights can lead to increased viscosity, complicating processing and fabrication [5]. The crosslinking density, achieved through the addition of crosslinkers such as vinyl-terminated silanes, further modulates PDMS’s mechanical behavior. Higher crosslinking densities result in increased rigidity and reduced elongation at break, while lower crosslinking densities maintain the polymer's flexibility and elasticity [3]. This tunable mechanical response is a key advantage of PDMS, allowing its properties to be tailored for specific applications. For instance, in biomedical applications requiring high flexibility, such as implantable sensors or soft robotics, low crosslinking densities are preferred, whereas higher crosslinking densities may be necessary for structural components requiring greater mechanical stability [5].\n\nThe interplay between molecular weight and crosslinking density also affects PDMS's thermal stability and degradation behavior. PDMS exhibits excellent thermal stability up to 250 °C, but its thermal degradation occurs via scission of the Si–O backbone, a process that is accelerated at high temperatures and in the presence of moisture [6]. The molecular architecture of PDMS, particularly the length and branching of the polymer chains, significantly influences its resistance to oxidative and hydrolytic degradation. Studies have shown that the presence of methyl groups and the absence of reactive functional groups make PDMS highly resistant to enzymatic and chemical degradation, further enhancing its biocompatibility and long-term stability in physiological environments [7].\n\nIn summary, the chemical structure and molecular properties of PDMS, including its Si–O backbone, methyl groups, molecular weight, and crosslinking density, collectively determine its outstanding material characteristics. These properties make PDMS an ideal candidate for a wide range of biomedical applications, from microfluidics to tissue engineering. Future research should focus on further optimizing the balance between molecular weight, crosslinking density, and functionalization to expand PDMS's utility in advanced biomedical systems.",

      "content": "The mechanical and physical properties of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are central to its widespread use in biomedical applications. As a silicone-based polymer, PDMS exhibits remarkable elasticity, flexibility, and durability, which are crucial for applications ranging from microfluidic devices to tissue engineering scaffolds. These properties stem from its unique molecular structure, which consists of a silicon-oxygen backbone with methyl groups attached to the silicon atoms. This structure allows for high chain mobility and low intermolecular interactions, resulting in a material that can undergo large deformations without permanent damage [8]. The elasticity of PDMS is often quantified using Young's modulus, which typically ranges from 0.2 to 1 MPa, depending on the crosslinking density and molecular weight of the polymer [9]. This low modulus makes PDMS highly compliant, enabling it to conform to complex biological surfaces and reducing mechanical stress on surrounding tissues.\n\nTensile strength and elongation at break are key indicators of PDMS's mechanical performance under uniaxial loading. PDMS demonstrates high elongation at break, often exceeding 100%, which is significantly higher than that of conventional elastomers such as natural rubber or polyurethane [10]. This property is particularly advantageous in biomedical applications that require repeated mechanical cycling, such as wearable sensors or implantable devices. However, the tensile strength of PDMS is relatively low, typically ranging from 0.5 to 5 MPa, which limits its use in load-bearing applications. To enhance mechanical performance, PDMS can be reinforced with fillers or blended with other polymers to achieve a balance between elasticity and strength [11].\n\nDurability and fatigue resistance are critical for long-term biomedical implants. PDMS is known for its excellent resistance to fatigue, making it suitable for devices that undergo cyclic mechanical stress, such as catheters or flexible biosensors [12]. However, the material's performance can be influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. PDMS exhibits a glass transition temperature (Tg) around -123°C, which means it remains flexible even at low temperatures, a feature that is beneficial for cryogenic applications [13]. At elevated temperatures, PDMS may experience thermal degradation, which can affect its mechanical integrity. Humidity can also impact PDMS by causing swelling or altering surface properties, necessitating surface treatments or encapsulation strategies in certain applications [14].\n\nThe interplay between PDMS's mechanical and physical properties and environmental conditions is an active area of research. Recent studies have explored the use of advanced characterization techniques, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), to better understand the material's response to external stimuli [15]. These insights are vital for optimizing PDMS-based devices for specific biomedical applications, ensuring both functionality and long-term reliability. As the demand for biocompatible and biodegradable materials grows, further research into the mechanical behavior of PDMS under physiological conditions will be essential to expand its utility in the field of biomedical engineering.",

      "level": 3,
      "content": "The chemical inertness and resistance to degradation of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are fundamental properties that underpin its widespread use in biomedical applications. PDMS, a silicon-based polymer with a backbone of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms, exhibits remarkable chemical stability due to the strong Si–O bond, which is highly resistant to hydrolysis and oxidation. This intrinsic chemical inertness minimizes the likelihood of unwanted reactions with biological fluids, enzymes, or other environmental factors, making PDMS a preferred material for long-term implantable devices and in vitro systems. Moreover, the absence of reactive functional groups on the PDMS backbone further enhances its resistance to degradation, ensuring that the material maintains its structural and mechanical integrity over extended periods [3].\n\nOne of the key advantages of PDMS is its resistance to enzymatic degradation. Unlike natural polymers such as collagen or chitosan, which can be rapidly broken down by proteases and other enzymes, PDMS remains largely unaffected by biological catalysts. This property is particularly important in biomedical devices that come into contact with bodily fluids, where enzymatic activity could compromise the material’s performance. Studies have shown that PDMS can maintain its mechanical and chemical properties even after prolonged exposure to physiological environments, such as saline solutions and blood plasma [3]. This stability is attributed to the non-polar and hydrophobic nature of PDMS, which limits the interaction between the polymer and water molecules, thereby reducing the potential for hydrolytic degradation [3].\n\nOxidative degradation is another critical concern for polymeric materials in biomedical applications, especially in environments with high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). PDMS, however, demonstrates excellent resistance to oxidative stress. The Si–O backbone is less susceptible to oxidation compared to carbon-based polymers, and the presence of methyl groups along the chain provides additional protection against radical-induced damage. This makes PDMS an ideal candidate for applications involving long-term exposure to oxidative conditions, such as in implantable sensors or devices used in chronic disease monitoring [3].\n\nThe chemical inertness of PDMS also plays a significant role in its biocompatibility. Unlike other materials that may elicit immune responses or cause inflammation, PDMS is generally well-tolerated by biological systems. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that PDMS does not induce significant cellular toxicity or immune activation, which is crucial for devices that require prolonged contact with tissues or blood [3]. Furthermore, the low surface energy of PDMS minimizes non-specific protein adsorption, reducing the risk of biofouling and improving the longevity of biomedical devices.\n\nDespite its advantages, PDMS is not entirely immune to degradation under extreme conditions. Prolonged exposure to high temperatures or certain solvents can lead to chain scission or crosslinking, which may affect its mechanical properties. However, such degradation is typically slow and can be mitigated through appropriate surface modifications or by incorporating stabilizing additives [4]. Additionally, while PDMS is resistant to most chemical attacks, its susceptibility to UV radiation and certain organic solvents remains a consideration in specific applications.\n\nFuture research in this area should focus on optimizing the chemical stability of PDMS for more demanding biomedical environments, such as those involving high mechanical stress or complex biochemical interactions. Emerging trends in surface functionalization and hybrid material design may offer new strategies to enhance PDMS's resistance to degradation while maintaining its intrinsic advantages. These innovations will be essential in expanding the utility of PDMS in next-generation biomedical devices.",

      "content": "The biocompatibility of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a cornerstone of its widespread use in biomedical applications, as it ensures minimal adverse interactions with biological systems. PDMS exhibits favorable biocompatibility due to its chemical inertness, low surface energy, and resistance to degradation, which collectively minimize the risk of immune responses and cellular toxicity [16]. This subsection evaluates in vitro and in vivo studies that assess PDMS's interactions with cells, focusing on cell adhesion, proliferation, and immune response, while emphasizing its suitability for biomedical applications.\n\nIn vitro studies have consistently demonstrated that PDMS supports cell adhesion and proliferation, making it an attractive substrate for tissue engineering and cell culture. For example, studies have shown that PDMS surfaces promote the adhesion of various cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and stem cells, without inducing significant cytotoxicity [3]. This is attributed to PDMS's hydrophobic nature, which can be modulated through surface modification techniques such as plasma treatment or chemical functionalization, thereby enhancing cell-material interactions [3]. The ability of PDMS to maintain cell viability over extended periods has been confirmed in long-term culture experiments, where cells exhibit normal growth patterns and metabolic activity [3].\n\nIn vivo studies further validate the biocompatibility of PDMS, as it has been extensively used in implantable devices, such as microfluidic chips and biosensors, without eliciting substantial immune responses. For instance, implantation studies have shown that PDMS-based devices remain stable in biological environments, with minimal inflammation and foreign body reaction observed at the implantation site [3]. The biocompatibility of PDMS is also influenced by its surface properties, as the hydrophobicity of PDMS can be engineered to control cell adhesion and tissue integration. For example, hydrophilic surface modifications have been shown to enhance cell spreading and promote tissue integration, while maintaining the material's inherent biocompatibility [3].\n\nDespite its favorable biocompatibility, PDMS is not entirely inert, and its long-term performance in vivo requires careful consideration. Some studies have reported subtle immune responses, particularly in chronic implantation scenarios, which can affect the performance of PDMS-based devices [4]. These findings highlight the importance of ongoing research into surface modification strategies and the development of hybrid materials that combine the advantages of PDMS with other biocompatible polymers.\n\nIn conclusion, PDMS's biocompatibility and cellular interactions make it a valuable material for a wide range of biomedical applications. Ongoing research continues to refine surface modification techniques and explore the integration of PDMS with other materials to further enhance its performance in vivo. Future studies should focus on long-term biocompatibility assessments and the development of advanced surface engineering strategies to optimize cell-material interactions.",

      "content": "Surface modification strategies are essential for tailoring the properties of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to meet the specific requirements of biomedical applications. While PDMS is inherently biocompatible, its native hydrophobicity, limited bioactivity, and poor cell adhesion characteristics often necessitate surface modifications to enhance its performance in biological environments. These modifications are critical for applications such as tissue engineering, biosensing, and drug delivery, where controlled interactions with cells and biological molecules are essential. Common strategies include plasma treatment, chemical functionalization, and bioactive coating, each with distinct advantages, limitations, and applications.\n\nPlasma treatment is one of the most widely used methods for modifying PDMS surfaces. This technique involves exposing the PDMS to reactive oxygen or nitrogen species generated by a plasma discharge, which can increase surface hydrophilicity and introduce functional groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, or carboxyl groups [3]. These groups can subsequently serve as anchors for further chemical modifications or bioactive molecule immobilization. Plasma treatment is particularly effective for improving cell adhesion and reducing non-specific protein adsorption. However, the hydrophilic effect is often temporary, as PDMS tends to rehydrophobize over time due to the migration of low-molecular-weight silicone species to the surface [3]. Despite this limitation, plasma treatment remains a popular choice due to its simplicity, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.\n\nChemical functionalization offers a more permanent and tailored approach to surface modification. Techniques such as silane-based chemistry and thiol-ene reactions allow for the covalent attachment of functional groups or biomolecules to the PDMS surface. For example, silane coupling agents can be used to graft peptides, proteins, or polysaccharides onto PDMS, thereby enhancing cell adhesion and bioactivity [3]. Thiol-ene chemistry, on the other hand, enables the rapid and efficient formation of covalent bonds between thiol-functionalized molecules and PDMS, making it suitable for applications requiring high stability and specificity [3]. While chemical functionalization provides superior control over surface chemistry, it often requires more complex procedures and can be more expensive compared to plasma treatment.\n\nCoating with bioactive molecules is another effective strategy for enhancing PDMS biocompatibility and cell-material interactions. Common coatings include polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is known for its anti-fouling properties and ability to reduce non-specific protein adsorption [3]. PEGylation can also improve the long-term stability of PDMS surfaces by preventing degradation and maintaining hydrophilicity. In addition to PEG, other bioactive coatings such as collagen, fibronectin, and laminin can be immobilized on PDMS to promote cell adhesion and proliferation. These coatings are typically applied through physical adsorption or covalent bonding, with the latter offering greater durability and resistance to washing. However, the efficiency and uniformity of these coatings can vary, depending on the surface chemistry and processing conditions.\n\nEmerging trends in surface modification strategies emphasize the integration of nanotechnology and advanced fabrication techniques. For instance, the use of nanoscale topography, such as nanopillars or nanogrooves, can influence cell behavior by mimicking the extracellular matrix and guiding cell alignment and migration [4]. Additionally, the incorporation of stimuli-responsive polymers or hydrogels into PDMS surfaces allows for dynamic control over cell adhesion and detachment, which is particularly useful in applications such as cell culture and tissue engineering. Future directions in this field will likely focus on developing more biocompatible and biodegradable PDMS derivatives, as well as combining surface modification strategies with machine learning and computational modeling to optimize performance and functionality.",

      "content": "The fabrication of PDMS-based microfluidic devices is a cornerstone of modern lab-on-a-chip systems, enabling the creation of intricate fluidic networks with high precision and biocompatibility. Among the most widely used techniques, soft lithography stands out due to its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and ability to produce microstructures with submicron resolution. This method involves the replication of a master mold, typically fabricated using photolithography, into PDMS through casting. The resulting microchannels exhibit excellent surface quality and are ideal for handling biological samples due to PDMS's transparency and inertness [3]. However, soft lithography is limited by its reliance on rigid master molds, which can be time-consuming and expensive to produce for complex geometries.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, replica molding and casting have emerged as viable alternatives, particularly for high-throughput and large-scale production. These techniques involve the direct replication of a master mold into PDMS without the need for photolithographic steps, thus reducing fabrication complexity and cost [3]. Recent advancements in 3D printing have also revolutionized PDMS microfabrication, allowing for the rapid prototyping of custom microfluidic devices with complex 3D geometries [3]. While 3D printing offers greater design flexibility, it currently faces challenges in achieving the high resolution and surface smoothness required for high-performance microfluidic applications. Grayscale lithography, another emerging technique, enables the fabrication of 3D microstructures by varying the exposure intensity during photolithography, providing a middle ground between traditional soft lithography and 3D printing [3].\n\nThe choice of fabrication method depends on the specific requirements of the application. For instance, applications requiring high-throughput screening may benefit from the scalability of replica molding, while research applications involving complex fluid dynamics may prefer the precision of soft lithography or the flexibility of 3D printing. The advantages of PDMS in terms of ease of fabrication, biocompatibility, and optical transparency make it a preferred material for microfluidic systems, especially in biomedical contexts where direct observation of cellular behavior is critical [3].\n\nDespite the progress, challenges such as surface hydrophobicity and gas permeability continue to affect the long-term stability and reliability of PDMS microfluidic devices. Surface modification techniques, such as plasma treatment and silane-based functionalization, are commonly employed to improve wettability and reduce non-specific protein adsorption. Additionally, hybrid fabrication approaches combining PDMS with other materials, such as polyurethane or silicon, are being explored to enhance mechanical durability and chemical resistance [4].\n\nFuture directions in PDMS microfabrication are likely to focus on the integration of advanced manufacturing techniques, such as digital microfluidics and microcontact printing, to enable more sophisticated and multifunctional microfluidic systems. As the demand for miniaturized and integrated biomedical devices continues to grow, the development of scalable and reproducible fabrication methods will remain a critical area of research. The ongoing refinement of PDMS-based fabrication techniques promises to expand the capabilities of microfluidic systems, paving the way for more precise and efficient biomedical applications.",

PDMS-based microfluidic devices have been extensively utilized in cell culture, drug delivery, and biochemical analysis, where their ability to support precise fluid control and real-time monitoring of biological processes is critical. The biocompatibility of PDMS ensures minimal interference with cellular functions, while its transparency facilitates optical access for imaging and sensing applications [9]. These properties have enabled the development of advanced microfluidic platforms for in vitro and in vivo studies, significantly advancing the field of lab-on-a-chip technologies.\n\nIn cell culture applications, PDMS microfluidic devices offer a controlled microenvironment that mimics physiological conditions, allowing for the study of cell behavior, differentiation, and interaction in a highly controllable manner. The material's ability to be precisely patterned and its compatibility with biological samples make it particularly suitable for 3D cell culture and organ-on-a-chip systems [9]. For instance, PDMS-based microfluidic channels can be engineered to provide gradient-based nutrient delivery, mechanical stimulation, and spatial confinement, all of which are essential for modeling complex biological tissues. Furthermore, the integration of PDMS with optical and electrical sensors has enabled real-time monitoring of cellular responses, facilitating dynamic studies of cellular processes [10].\n\nPDMS is also a key component in drug delivery microsystems, where it is used to fabricate microchannels, reservoirs, and valves for controlled and sustained release of therapeutic agents. The material's low surface energy and inert nature prevent non-specific adsorption of drugs and biological molecules, ensuring accurate dosing and minimizing contamination risks [10].

These challenges include surface hydrophobicity, gas permeability, and long-term reliability, which collectively impact the accuracy, reproducibility, and practical deployment of PDMS devices.\n\nOne of the primary challenges in PDMS microfluidics is its inherent surface hydrophobicity, which can lead to poor wettability and unpredictable fluid behavior in microchannels [3]. This hydrophobicity hinders the uniform distribution of aqueous solutions and can cause air bubbles to form, disrupting the flow and affecting the accuracy of assays. To overcome this, surface modification techniques such as oxygen plasma treatment, silane functionalization, and hydrophilic coatings have been employed. However, these treatments often degrade over time, necessitating repeated reconditioning [3]. Research has shown that hydrophilic coatings, while effective in improving wettability, may not be stable under prolonged exposure to biological fluids, thereby compromising device integrity [3].\n\nAnother critical limitation is the high gas permeability of PDMS, which makes it suitable for gas exchange in certain applications but problematic in others. For instance, in long-term experiments or in devices requiring stable fluid environments, PDMS’s permeability can lead to unintended diffusion of gases, altering the chemical composition of the fluid and affecting experimental outcomes [3]. This has been particularly problematic in applications such as cell culture, where gas concentration must be precisely controlled. To address this, encapsulation techniques and hybrid material integration have been explored to reduce gas exchange while maintaining PDMS’s flexibility and transparency [3].\n\nLong-term reliability is another significant concern. PDMS is susceptible to mechanical fatigue and chemical degradation over extended periods, especially under continuous flow or repeated use. This can lead to structural deformation, loss of seal integrity, and contamination risks. Studies have shown that PDMS microchannels may exhibit dimensional changes due to swelling or shrinkage, which can disrupt fluid dynamics and device performance [3]. Advanced fabrication techniques, such as 3D printing and the use of crosslinking agents, have been proposed to enhance the mechanical stability of PDMS structures [3].\n\nFuture research should focus on developing more durable and chemically stable PDMS variants, as well as on optimizing surface modification strategies for long-term functionality. Additionally, the integration of PDMS with more robust materials, such as elastomers or hybrid composites, may offer solutions to the challenges of gas permeability and mechanical fatigue.

These scaffolds are engineered to mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM) and provide a supportive environment for cell growth, differentiation, and tissue regeneration. The methodologies employed in the design and fabrication of PDMS-based scaffolds can be broadly categorized into conventional and advanced techniques, each offering distinct advantages and limitations.\n\nConventional fabrication methods such as soft lithography and molding are widely used due to their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and ability to produce intricate microstructures. Soft lithography involves the use of photolithography to create a master mold, which is then used to replicate the desired microchannel structures in PDMS [3]. This method is particularly effective for creating scaffolds with defined topographies and porous structures that facilitate cell infiltration and nutrient diffusion. However, the resolution and complexity of the structures are limited by the resolution of the photolithographic process. Molding techniques, on the other hand, allow for the replication of complex geometries by casting PDMS into pre-fabricated molds. This method is highly scalable and suitable for the fabrication of large-area scaffolds, though it may require post-processing to achieve the desired surface properties [3].\n\nAdvanced fabrication techniques, such as 3D printing and microfabrication, have opened new avenues for the design of PDMS-based scaffolds with enhanced functionality and customizability. 3D printing enables the fabrication of scaffolds with complex 3D architectures and tailored porosity, making it ideal for creating patient-specific scaffolds.

These properties, combined with the ease of microfabrication, have made PDMS a cornerstone in the development of microfluidic-based organ-on-a-chip platforms [10]. By integrating PDMS with microfluidic channels, researchers can precisely control the delivery of nutrients, drugs, and other biochemical signals, thereby creating highly controllable and reproducible in vitro models of human organs [10].\n\nOne of the key advantages of PDMS in 3D cell culture is its ability to support complex, multi-cellular configurations that closely resemble in vivo conditions. Unlike traditional 2D cell culture systems, PDMS-based scaffolds can be engineered to provide 3D microenvironments that promote cell aggregation, tissue-like organization, and intercellular signaling. This is particularly important for studying processes such as angiogenesis, immune cell interaction, and drug metabolism, which are inherently 3D in nature [10]. Additionally, the flexibility of PDMS allows for the development of dynamic cultures that can mimic the mechanical stresses and strains experienced by cells in vivo, such as those in the lung, heart, or blood vessels [10].\n\nDespite its advantages, PDMS also presents several challenges in the context of long-term 3D cell culture and organ-on-a-chip systems. Its hydrophobic nature can hinder cell adhesion and lead to non-specific protein adsorption, which can interfere with cellular functions and experimental outcomes. To overcome this, various surface modification strategies have been employed, including plasma treatment, chemical functionalization, and the incorporation of bioactive coatings [22].

While PDMS offers advantages such as biocompatibility, flexibility, and transparency, its intrinsic hydrophobicity and lack of bioactive functional groups often limit its direct application in tissue engineering. To address these limitations, various surface modification techniques have been developed to introduce functional groups, alter surface topography, and improve the interaction between PDMS scaffolds and biological systems. These strategies are essential for the development of advanced scaffolding materials that can support complex cellular processes and mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM) environment.\n\nPlasma treatment is one of the most widely used techniques for modifying the surface of PDMS. By exposing PDMS to reactive plasma, the surface can be activated, increasing its hydrophilicity and introducing functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), carbonyl (-C=O), and carboxyl (-COOH) groups. This modification enhances cell adhesion by improving wettability and providing reactive sites for subsequent biofunctionalization. Studies have shown that plasma-treated PDMS surfaces exhibit improved cell attachment and spreading compared to unmodified PDMS [3]. However, the hydrophilic surface generated through plasma treatment is often unstable over time, as the surface tends to revert to its hydrophobic state due to the low surface energy of PDMS. To overcome this, surface passivation techniques or further chemical functionalization may be required.\n\nChemical functionalization strategies, such as silane-based and thiol-ene chemistry, are also extensively used to introduce specific bioactive molecules onto PDMS surfaces. Silane coupling agents, such as 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) or 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS), can be used to graft functional groups that promote cell adhesion or serve as anchors for subsequent bioconjugation. Thiol-ene reactions offer an alternative approach, where thiol-functionalized molecules can react with double bonds on the PDMS surface, allowing for the attachment of peptides, proteins, or other bioactive molecules [3]. These strategies enable the precise control of surface chemistry and have been shown to significantly enhance cell-scaffold interactions.\n\nIn addition to chemical modification, topographical engineering of PDMS surfaces has emerged as a powerful approach to influence cell behavior. Techniques such as nanoimprint lithography and soft lithography allow for the creation of micro- and nano-scale patterns on the surface of PDMS scaffolds, which can guide cell alignment, migration, and differentiation. The combination of surface topography with chemical cues provides a multifaceted approach to create biomimetic scaffolding environments.\n\nDespite the progress made in PDMS surface modification, challenges remain in terms of long-term stability, uniformity of modification, and the need for scalable fabrication methods. Future research should focus on the development of robust and biocompatible surface modification techniques that can be easily integrated into existing fabrication processes while maintaining the mechanical and biological performance of PDMS scaffolds.

This synergy not only expands the range of applications for PDMS in tissue engineering but also enables the design of scaffolds that better mimic the complexity of native extracellular matrices [3].\n\nOne of the most common approaches involves the integration of PDMS with hydrogels, which are inherently bioactive and capable of supporting cell proliferation and differentiation. For instance, PDMS-hydrogel composites have been used to create flexible, biocompatible scaffolds for applications such as cartilage and skin tissue engineering [3]. These hybrid systems benefit from the mechanical flexibility and durability of PDMS, while hydrogels provide the necessary biochemical cues to support cell growth. However, the interfacial compatibility between PDMS and hydrogels remains a challenge, often requiring surface modification or the use of intermediate layers to ensure strong adhesion and uniform mechanical behavior [3].\n\nAnother promising strategy involves the combination of PDMS with ceramic or mineral-based materials, such as hydroxyapatite (HA) or calcium phosphate. These inorganic components improve the mechanical strength and osteoconductivity of PDMS scaffolds, making them more suitable for bone tissue engineering applications [3]. For example, PDMS-HA composites have been shown to enhance cell adhesion and mineralization, which are crucial for bone regeneration. However, the brittleness of ceramic components can introduce mechanical instability, necessitating careful optimization of the composite composition and structure [3].\n\nNatural polymers, such as collagen, chitosan, and alginate, are also frequently combined with PDMS to improve the biological performance of scaffolds. These materials provide a more biologically relevant environment for cell growth, while PDMS contributes to the scaffold’s flexibility and ease of fabrication. For instance, PDMS-collagen composites have been used in vascular tissue engineering to create biocompatible, stretchable conduits that support endothelial cell growth [4]. Nevertheless, the degradation rates and mechanical properties of natural polymers can vary, requiring tailored design to match the specific needs of the target tissue [5].\n\nIn addition to improving mechanical and biological properties, the integration of PDMS with other biomaterials can enable advanced functionalities, such as responsive or smart scaffolding.

      "content": "PDMS has emerged as a critical material in the realm of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and advanced imaging modalities, offering unique properties that enhance the performance and versatility of imaging systems. Its transparency, flexibility, and biocompatibility make it an ideal candidate for fabricating optical components and integrating with imaging technologies. In OCT, PDMS is utilized to create adaptable and high-resolution imaging probes, enabling improved visualization of biological tissues in both in vivo and ex vivo settings [3]. The material's mechanical flexibility allows for the development of conformable optical elements that can maintain consistent contact with complex biological surfaces, thereby improving image quality and reducing artifacts [3]. Furthermore, PDMS's optical clarity ensures minimal signal loss and distortion, making it suitable for high-resolution OCT applications [3].\n\nBeyond OCT, PDMS plays a significant role in other advanced imaging modalities, such as multiphoton microscopy and confocal imaging. In these techniques, PDMS is employed to fabricate microstructured optical elements, such as waveguides and lenses, which can be tailored to specific imaging requirements [3]. The material's ease of fabrication via soft lithography and molding techniques allows for the precise control of optical element geometry, enhancing the resolution and depth of field in imaging systems [3]. Additionally, PDMS's ability to be coated with functional materials, such as biocompatible polymers or bioactive molecules, facilitates the development of hybrid imaging systems that combine optical and biochemical functionalities [4]. This versatility has enabled the creation of multifunctional imaging platforms that can simultaneously monitor multiple biological parameters, such as pH, oxygen levels, and cellular activity [5].\n\nThe integration of PDMS with optical sensors and detectors has further expanded its applications in biomedical imaging. PDMS-based optical sensors are commonly used to monitor physiological parameters in real-time, offering a non-invasive and continuous monitoring capability [3]. These sensors are often combined with microfluidic systems to enable the simultaneous analysis of fluid dynamics and cellular behavior, making them valuable tools for studying biological processes in controlled environments [5]. The use of PDMS in these systems also facilitates the development of wearable and implantable biosensors, which can provide long-term monitoring of health metrics without causing significant discomfort to the user [6].\n\nDespite its advantages, the application of PDMS in advanced imaging modalities is not without challenges. One of the primary limitations is its relatively low refractive index compared to other optical materials, which can affect the performance of optical components such as lenses and waveguides [7]. Additionally, the long-term stability of PDMS under continuous optical and mechanical stress remains a concern, particularly in applications requiring prolonged use [5]. Addressing these challenges will require further research into material modification strategies, such as the incorporation of high-refractive-index fillers or the development of hybrid PDMS-based composites [17].\n\nLooking ahead, the continued integration of PDMS with emerging imaging technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, holds great promise for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of biomedical imaging systems [23]. By leveraging the unique properties of PDMS and combining them with advanced computational methods, future imaging systems could achieve unprecedented levels of resolution, flexibility, and adaptability. As such, PDMS is poised to play an increasingly important role in the evolution of biomedical imaging and optics.",

As a silicone-based polymer, PDMS exhibits a unique combination of biocompatibility, mechanical flexibility, chemical inertness, and optical transparency, making it an ideal candidate for applications ranging from microfluidics and biosensing to tissue engineering and drug delivery. These properties have enabled PDMS to become a cornerstone in the development of lab-on-a-chip systems, where its compatibility with biological samples and ease of fabrication have facilitated the creation of highly integrated and functional microdevices [3]. Furthermore, PDMS's ability to support 3D cell culture and organ-on-a-chip platforms has significantly advanced in vitro models for studying cellular behavior and physiological processes [3]. Its adaptability in biosensing applications, particularly in the development of flexible and wearable sensors, has also been a major area of innovation, with PDMS-based tactile and pressure sensors demonstrating high sensitivity and durability in real-time health monitoring systems [3].\n\nDespite its numerous advantages, PDMS-based systems face several challenges that must be addressed to fully realize their potential in biomedical technologies. One of the primary limitations is the material's inherent hydrophobicity, which can hinder fluid flow in microfluidic systems and necessitate surface modification techniques to improve wettability and biocompatibility [3]. Additionally, the long-term stability and biocompatibility of PDMS in vivo remain concerns, particularly in implantable devices where prolonged exposure to biological environments can lead to degradation and immune responses [4]. Moreover, the mechanical properties of PDMS, while favorable for certain applications, may not be optimal for all biomedical scenarios, necessitating the development of hybrid materials and advanced fabrication techniques to enhance performance [3]. These challenges highlight the need for continued research into optimizing PDMS for specific applications and exploring new material combinations that can overcome its limitations.\n\nLooking ahead, future research should focus on advancing the integration of PDMS with emerging technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance the performance and adaptability of PDMS-based systems. For instance, the application of machine learning in biosensing and drug delivery systems can enable real-time data analysis and personalized therapeutic interventions [3].
