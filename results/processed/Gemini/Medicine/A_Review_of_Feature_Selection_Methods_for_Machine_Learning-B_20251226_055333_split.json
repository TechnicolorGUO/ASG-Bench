Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a pivotal tool for leveraging this data to predict disease risk, enabling the transition from reactive healthcare to precision medicine [cite: 1, 2]. However, the efficacy of ML models in clinical settings is frequently hampered by the \"curse of dimensionality,\" a phenomenon where the number of features (e.g., gene expression levels, clinical variables) vastly exceeds the number of samples [cite: 1].\n\nIn disease risk prediction, irrelevant or redundant features not only increase computational cost but also introduce noise that degrades predictive accuracy and obscures biological interpretability. Feature Selection (FS)—the process of identifying a subset of relevant features—is therefore not merely a preprocessing step but a fundamental requirement for building robust, generalizable, and clinically interpretable models [cite: 2, 3].\n\nThis review provides a comprehensive analysis of the landscape of feature selection methods for disease prediction. Unlike previous surveys that focus primarily on traditional statistical approaches, this paper critically examines state-of-the-art advancements emerging in 2024 and 2025, including **Causal Feature Selection**, **Federated Feature Selection**, and **LLM-driven selection**. We evaluate these methods based on their ability to handle high-dimensional data, ensure stability, and provide causal explanations, thereby bridging the gap between computational innovation and clinical utility.",

They are computationally efficient but often ignore feature dependencies [cite: 2, 4].\n2.  **Wrapper Methods:** These methods treat feature selection as a search problem, evaluating subsets by training a specific predictive model (e.g., Recursive Feature Elimination or RFE). While they often yield higher accuracy, they are computationally expensive and prone to overfitting [cite: 4, 5].\n3.  **Embedded Methods:** Feature selection is integrated directly into the model training process. Examples include LASSO (L1 regularization) and tree-based importance (Random Forest, XGBoost). These offer a balance between computational efficiency and interaction modeling [cite: 2, 6].",

While interpretable, these methods failed to capture complex, non-linear interactions between risk factors [cite: 1].\n*   **The Machine Learning Era (2000s–2015):** The introduction of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests popularized multivariate selection. Techniques like SVM-RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) became gold standards for gene expression analysis [cite: 12, 13]. The concept of \"stability\" in FS was formalized during this period by Kuncheva (2007), addressing the reproducibility crisis in biomarker discovery [cite: 14].\n*   **The Deep Learning and Causal Era (2016–Present):** The rise of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) led to \"black-box\" models, necessitating explainable AI (XAI) methods like SHAP and LIME for feature attribution [cite: 15, 16]. Concurrently, the integration of causal inference (e.g., CausalDRIFT) and privacy-preserving Federated Learning has redefined the field, addressing modern challenges of data silos and spurious correlations [cite: 11, 17].",

It excels in high-dimensional, low-sample-size (HDLSS) settings (e.g., breast cancer datasets), achieving competitive accuracy while prioritizing features with causal influence rather than mere association [cite: 11].\n*   **Markov Blanket Discovery (SF-DRMB):** The Simultaneous-Fusion-of-Double-Rules Markov Blanket (SF-DRMB) algorithm addresses errors in conditional independence tests. By refining the identification of parents, children, and spouses of the target node, it improves the robustness of risk factor mining, outperforming traditional Bayesian network methods [cite: 10].",

This method, termed *LLM-Select*, has shown performance rivaling data-driven methods like LASSO, particularly in domains where semantic knowledge is valuable. It is especially useful for determining which features to collect *before* data acquisition begins [cite: 18, 19, 20].\n*   **Clinical Prediction with LLMs (CPLLM):** This approach fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs on historical medical records to predict disease diagnosis and readmission.

This method allows healthcare institutions to collaboratively identify globally relevant features without sharing raw patient data. It utilizes backward elimination and threshold variation to improve communication efficiency by 4 to 14 times compared to standard FL [cite: 17, 22].\n*   **Handling Non-IID Data:** Heterogeneity in medical data (Non-IID) across hospitals poses a major challenge.
