Oxidative stress, characterized by an excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) relative to the antioxidant defense system, is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous chronic conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and aging [cite: 1, 2]. Consequently, the identification and quantification of antioxidant compounds in foods, pharmaceuticals, and biological fluids have become central themes in food science and clinical biochemistry.\n\nAntioxidants are broadly defined as substances that, when present at low concentrations compared to an oxidizable substrate, significantly delay or prevent the oxidation of that substrate [cite: 3]. However, the complexity of antioxidant defense systems—which include enzymatic (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase) and non-enzymatic (e.g., vitamins C and E, polyphenols) components—precludes the existence of a single, universal method for measuring antioxidant activity [cite: 2, 4].\n\nThis review provides a comprehensive analysis of the analytical methods used to determine antioxidant activity. It examines the theoretical frameworks distinguishing reaction mechanisms, traces the historical evolution of these assays, evaluates state-of-the-art chemical and cellular techniques, and critically discusses the limitations that currently challenge the field, particularly the translation of in vitro results to in vivo efficacy.",

The general reaction is $ROO^\\bullet + AH \\rightarrow ROOH + A^\\bullet$. These reactions are typically solvent-independent and rapid, mimicking the chain-breaking action of antioxidants in lipid peroxidation. Examples include the Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) and Total Radical-Trapping Antioxidant Parameter (TRAP) assays [cite: 6, 7].\n*   **Single Electron Transfer (SET):** SET-based assays involve the transfer of an electron from the antioxidant to the oxidant, resulting in a color change in the probe. The reaction is $M(n) + e^- \\rightarrow M(n-1)$. These assays are pH-dependent and generally slower than HAT reactions. Examples include the Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) and Cupric Reducing Antioxidant Capacity (CUPRAC) assays [cite: 5, 6].\n*   **Mixed Mode:** Some assays, such as DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)), can operate via both HAT and SET mechanisms depending on the solvent and pH conditions [cite: 7, 9].",

      "content": "The determination of antioxidant activity has matured from simple colorimetric tests to complex, biologically relevant models. While classical chemical assays like DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS remain valuable for initial screening and quality control due to their cost-effectiveness and simplicity, they offer limited insight into physiological efficacy. The field is currently undergoing a necessary transformation, driven by the realization that \"antioxidant capacity\" in a test tube does not equate to health benefits in the human body.\n\nFuture research must prioritize the standardization of analytical protocols and the adoption of cellular assays like CAA and in vivo biomarkers like F2-isoprostanes. Furthermore, the integration of nanotechnology and metabolomics promises to provide a more granular understanding of how specific antioxidant compounds interact with biological systems. Ultimately, a multi-methodological approach—combining chemical capacity, cellular protection, and molecular profiling—is essential for the accurate assessment of antioxidant activity in the modern scientific landscape.",
