In China, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) was deployed extensively alongside Western medicine as part of a unique integrative treatment model. This systematic literature review evaluates the efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19, with a specific focus on the \"Three Medicines and Three Prescriptions\" (Lianhua Qingwen, Jinhua Qinggan, Xuebijing, Qingfei Paidu, Huashibaidu, and Xuanfeibaidu). A comprehensive analysis of randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and pharmacological studies reveals that TCM interventions are associated with improved clinical cure rates, shortened viral shedding duration, and reduced progression to critical illness. Mechanistic studies suggest these effects are mediated through antiviral activity and immunomodulation, specifically the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Despite promising results, the field faces challenges regarding methodological heterogeneity and international standardization. This paper synthesizes current evidence, identifies research gaps, and proposes future directions for the modernization and global integration of TCM in pandemic preparedness.\n\n---",

      "content": "The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in late 2019 led to a pandemic that overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide. In the absence of specific antiviral agents during the early stages of the outbreak, the National Health Commission of China implemented a strategy of integrating Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with conventional Western medicine [cite: 1, 13]. This approach was predicated on the historical success of TCM in managing epidemic diseases, including the 2003 SARS outbreak and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [cite: 14, 15].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the substantial volume of clinical data generated regarding TCM's role in COVID-19 management. Reports indicate that over 90% of confirmed cases in China received some form of TCM treatment [cite: 3, 16]. Unlike the reductionist approach often seen in Western pharmacology, which targets specific viral proteins, TCM employs a holistic approach based on syndrome differentiation (*Bian Zheng*), aiming to restore physiological balance and enhance the host's immune response [cite: 6, 17].\n\nThis paper aims to provide a comprehensive, critical analysis of the existing literature. It examines the \"Three Medicines and Three Prescriptions\" which form the core of the official TCM treatment protocol, analyzes the molecular mechanisms through network pharmacology, and evaluates clinical outcomes ranging from symptom relief in mild cases to the suppression of cytokine storms in severe cases. Furthermore, it addresses the emerging application of TCM in treating Long COVID and discusses the methodological hurdles that must be overcome for broader scientific acceptance.",
