This systematic scoping review examines the current state of LLM applications in education, synthesizing findings from peer-reviewed literature published between 2017 and 2025. While LLMs demonstrate potential in automating laborious tasks—such as question generation, feedback provision, and essay grading—their adoption is fraught with significant practical and ethical challenges. Practical hurdles include the phenomenon of \"hallucination,\" lack of replicability, and high computational resource requirements. Ethical concerns are dominated by issues of algorithmic bias, data privacy, and the opacity of model decision-making. This paper critically analyzes these dimensions, categorizing 53 distinct use cases and identifying a pressing need for human-centered design frameworks. We conclude that while LLMs are powerful tools, their responsible deployment requires robust ethical guidelines, teacher-AI partnership models, and technical innovations like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure beneficence and equity in education.",

The field is characterized by a tension between the \"stochastic parrot\" nature of the technology and the high-stakes requirement for accuracy and fairness in education.\n\nKey findings suggest that the future of LLMs in education lies not in unmonitored automation, but in **structured Human-AI collaboration**. To move forward, the academic and ed-tech communities must prioritize:\n1.  **Transparency:** Open-sourcing models and datasets to ensure replicability.\n2.  **Equity:** Rigorous auditing of models for cultural and grading biases.\n3.  **Safety:** Implementing RAG and other grounding techniques to minimize hallucinations.\n\nBy adopting a human-centered approach that values pedagogical soundness over mere technological novelty, stakeholders can harness the power of LLMs to enhance, rather than undermine, the educational experience.",
