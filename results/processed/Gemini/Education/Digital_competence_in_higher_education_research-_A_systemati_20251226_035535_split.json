Evidence suggests a discrepancy between self-perceived skills and actual performance, highlighting a need for more objective, performance-based evaluation methods.\n*   **Teacher vs. Student Competence:** While early research focused on students (\"digital natives\"), recent trends emphasize the critical gap in faculty competence. Without digitally competent educators, the integration of technology into pedagogy remains superficial.\n*   **The AI Frontier:** The emergence of Generative AI has disrupted the field, necessitating new frameworks (e.g., UNESCO 2024) that integrate AI literacy with traditional digital competence, focusing on ethics and human-centered mindsets.\n\n---",

No longer a peripheral skill, digital competence has become a prerequisite for academic success, employability, and active citizenship in the 21st century [cite: 1, 2]. The integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into educational environments has shifted from a technical novelty to a structural necessity, a transition accelerated dramatically by the COVID-19 pandemic [cite: 2, 3].\n\nDespite the ubiquity of digital tools, the assumption that university students—often labeled \"digital natives\"—possess inherent academic digital competence has been challenged by empirical evidence [cite: 4, 5]. Simultaneously, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) face the dual challenge of upskilling faculty to teach *with* technology (pedagogical digital competence) and preparing students to work *in* a digitalized economy [cite: 6, 7].\n\nThis systematic literature review synthesizes research on digital competence in HE. It examines the evolution of definitions, the frameworks guiding policy and practice, the methods used to assess competence, and the emerging challenges posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI). The review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the field's current state, identifying critical gaps between policy rhetoric and educational reality.",

In contrast, \"digital competence\" is favored in continental Europe and policy contexts, often implying a broader set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes [cite: 8, 10].\n*   **Holistic Definitions:** Early definitions focused on technical proficiency (instrumental skills). However, current consensus defines digital competence as a multidimensional construct. It involves the confident, critical, and responsible use of digital technologies for learning, work, and societal participation [cite: 11, 12]. It encompasses not just technical operation but also information management, communication, content creation, safety, and problem-solving [cite: 9, 13].",
