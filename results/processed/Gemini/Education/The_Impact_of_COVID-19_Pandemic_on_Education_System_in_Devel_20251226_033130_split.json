While the crisis was global, its impact was disproportionately severe in developing countries, where pre-existing structural inequalities, digital divides, and resource constraints exacerbated learning losses. This systematic literature review synthesizes evidence regarding the impact of the pandemic on education systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It critically examines the distinction between \"Emergency Remote Teaching\" (ERT) and planned online learning, analyzes the \"triple shock\" to health, economies, and education, and evaluates the efficacy of various intervention modalities ranging from high-tech platforms to low-tech solutions like radio and SMS. Key findings indicate that learning poverty in LMICs potentially increased from 53% to 70%, with a projected loss of $17 trillion in lifetime earnings for the affected generation. Furthermore, the review highlights significant gendered impacts, including increased teenage pregnancy and dropout rates, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. The paper concludes by identifying critical research gaps and proposing future directions for building resilient education systems.\n\n---",

It often lacks the theoretical foundations of online pedagogy and is frequently described as \"panicgogy\" or a \"band-aid\" solution [cite: 12, 13, 14].\n\nIn developing countries, the conflation of these terms has led to unrealistic expectations and negative perceptions of e-learning, as the ERT experience was often marred by technical failures and lack of preparation [cite: 15, 16].",
