This systematic rapid review synthesizes literature published between late 2022 and early 2025 to evaluate the multifaceted impact of ChatGPT on education. The review analyzes the technological evolution from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, exploring its performance on standardized academic assessments, its utility as a pedagogical tool, and the profound ethical and cognitive challenges it presents. Findings indicate a \"double-edged sword\" dynamic: while ChatGPT offers unprecedented opportunities for personalized learning, automated feedback, and accessibility, it simultaneously poses significant risks regarding academic integrity, cognitive disengagement (\"lazy thinking\"), and information reliability. The paper concludes that the future of education lies not in prohibition but in the redesign of assessment strategies and the cultivation of AI literacy.\n\n---",

Unlike previous educational technologies that required specialized training, ChatGPT provided a user-friendly, natural language interface capable of generating human-like text, solving complex problems, and coding, thereby democratizing access to powerful generative AI (GenAI) capabilities [cite: 3, 4].\n\nThe educational sector’s reaction was immediate and polarized. Initial responses ranged from enthusiastic adoption by early innovators to complete prohibitions by major school districts and universities fearing an epidemic of contract cheating and plagiarism [cite: 5, 6]. As the technology evolved from GPT-3.5 to the more capable GPT-4 and GPT-4o, the discourse shifted from binary debates on banning versus using to more nuanced discussions on *how* to integrate these tools effectively while mitigating harm [cite: 7, 8].",

However, it simultaneously threatens the traditional foundations of academic integrity and raises valid concerns about the erosion of critical thinking skills [cite: 39, 40].\n\nThe consensus emerging from the rapid review is that prohibition is futile. Instead, the educational community must pivot toward **adaptation**. This involves a tripartite approach:\n1.  **Pedagogical Innovation:** Moving from passive information consumption to active, inquiry-based learning where AI serves as a scaffold rather than a crutch.\n2.  **Assessment Reform:** shifting value from the final product to the learning process.\n3.  **Ethical Integration:** Teaching students not just *how* to use the tool, but *when* and *why* to use it (or not use it).\n\nAs GPT-4 and future models continue to approach or exceed human performance on standardized metrics, the value of human education will increasingly depend on the cultivation of skills that AI cannot easily replicate: critical judgment, ethical reasoning, and complex, real-world problem solving.\n\n---",
