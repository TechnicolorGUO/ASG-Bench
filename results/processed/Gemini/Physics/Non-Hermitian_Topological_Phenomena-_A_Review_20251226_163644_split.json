Unlike conventional Hermitian systems, where energy conservation and orthogonal eigenstates are paramount, non-Hermitian systems—characterized by gain, loss, and non-reciprocity—exhibit unique spectral singularities and topological invariants. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of non-Hermitian topological phenomena. We examine foundational concepts such as Exceptional Points (EPs), the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect (NHSE), and the distinction between point and line gaps. We trace the historical development from Parity-Time ($\\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry to the 38-fold symmetry classification of non-Hermitian topological phases. Furthermore, we critically evaluate state-of-the-art experimental platforms, including topological lasers and topolectrical circuits, and address the ongoing debate regarding the fundamental signal-to-noise ratio limits of EP-based sensors. Finally, we identify key challenges and outline future research directions, particularly in non-Abelian braiding and interacting non-Hermitian systems.\n\n---",

      "content": "For much of the 20th century, quantum mechanics and solid-state physics were built upon the axiom of Hermiticity. The Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}$, representing the total energy of a closed system, was required to be Hermitian ($\\hat{H} = \\hat{H}^\\dagger$) to guarantee real eigenvalues and unitary time evolution [cite: 1, 2]. However, this framework is an idealization; realistic systems are inevitably coupled to their environments, exchanging energy and particles. Such open systems are effectively described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, where eigenvalues become complex, representing decay (loss) or amplification (gain) [cite: 2, 3].\n\nIn parallel, the discovery of the Quantum Hall Effect and Topological Insulators (TIs) revolutionized our understanding of phases of matter, classifying materials not by symmetry breaking but by global topological invariants (e.g., Chern numbers) [cite: 4, 5]. The intersection of these two fields—**Non-Hermitian Topological Physics**—has revealed that non-Hermiticity is not merely a perturbation that destroys topological order, but a fundamental modifier that enriches it [cite: 6, 7].\n\nThe motivation for this field is twofold. Theoretically, non-Hermitian systems defy the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC), leading to novel phenomena like the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect (NHSE), where bulk eigenstates localize macroscopically at boundaries [cite: 8, 9]. Experimentally, the ability to engineer gain and loss in classical wave systems (photonics, acoustics, electric circuits) has enabled the realization of devices with unprecedented functionalities, such as topological insulator lasers that combine robustness with high slope efficiency [cite: 10, 11].\n\nThis paper reviews the current state of non-Hermitian topological phenomena. We begin by defining key concepts, followed by a historical overview. We then discuss theoretical methods, experimental applications, and the critical challenges facing the field.\n\n---",

Systems with line gaps can often be adiabatically deformed to Hermitian or anti-Hermitian limits, inheriting conventional topological classifications (extrinsic topology) [cite: 14, 17].\n2.  **Point Gap:** The spectrum does not cross a specific reference point $E_{ref}$ (usually $E=0$). This allows for a non-trivial winding number of the complex spectrum around $E_{ref}$, a phenomenon with no Hermitian analog (intrinsic topology) [cite: 14, 16].

The field has rapidly matured from abstract mathematical classifications to concrete applications in robust lasing and versatile circuit simulations.\n\nHowever, significant hurdles remain. The practical utility of EP sensors hinges on resolving the SNR debate, and the extension of these concepts to the quantum many-body regime is in its infancy. As the community addresses these challenges, the interplay between topology, symmetry, and dissipation promises to yield next-generation technologies and deeper insights into the nature of open systems.\n\n---",
