Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) constitute a class of deep learning algorithms capable of solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding the governing physical laws into the network's objective function. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of PINNs within the specific domain of fluid mechanics. We examine the foundational architectures, mathematical formulations, and the historical trajectory from simple laminar flow solvers to complex turbulence modeling. The review critically assesses state-of-the-art techniques designed to mitigate spectral bias and optimization stiffness, including domain decomposition (cPINNs, XPINNs), causal training strategies, and hard-constraint enforcement. Furthermore, we explore diverse applications ranging from hemodynamic super-resolution to high-Reynolds-number aerodynamic flows. Finally, we identify persistent challenges regarding computational efficiency and convergence in chaotic regimes, outlining future research directions for hybridizing PINNs with traditional solvers and neural operators.",

Traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) relies on mesh-based numerical methods—such as Finite Difference (FDM), Finite Volume (FVM), and Finite Element Methods (FEM)—to discretize the spatial and temporal domains [cite: 1, 2]. While these methods have achieved high fidelity, they face significant limitations: they are computationally expensive for high-dimensional problems, require laborious mesh generation for complex geometries, and struggle to seamlessly integrate noisy observational data for inverse problems [cite: 3, 4, 5].\n\nIn recent years, Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) has emerged as a paradigm to bridge the gap between data-driven models and physical principles. Among these, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), introduced in the seminal work by Raissi et al. (2019), have garnered intense interest [cite: 3]. Unlike purely data-driven approaches that require massive labeled datasets, PINNs leverage the governing differential equations as a regularization mechanism, allowing them to learn from sparse data or, in forward problems, from no labeled data at all [cite: 6, 7].\n\nThe motivation for applying PINNs to fluid mechanics is threefold. First, PINNs offer a mesh-free alternative, potentially circumventing the difficulties of grid generation in complex domains [cite: 6]. Second, they excel at inverse modeling, enabling the reconstruction of flow fields and the estimation of unknown parameters (e.g., Reynolds number, viscosity) directly from sparse measurements [cite: 4, 8]. Third, they provide a unified framework for data assimilation, blending experimental results (e.g., PIV, MRI) with physical laws to enhance resolution and accuracy [cite: 9, 10].",

While they are not yet a replacement for traditional CFD in standard forward simulations due to computational costs and optimization challenges, they are transformative for inverse problems, data assimilation, and surrogate modeling. With the advent of advanced architectures like XPINNs, causal training, and operator learning, PINNs are progressively overcoming their initial limitations, paving the way for real-time, high-fidelity digital twins in aerospace, biomedical, and industrial engineering.",
