Unlike Hermitian systems, where bulk states are extended and boundary states are sparse, the NHSE is characterized by the macroscopic accumulation of bulk eigenstates at the boundaries of a lattice under open boundary conditions. This review provides a comprehensive systematic analysis of the NHSE, tracing its historical emergence from the Hatano-Nelson model to contemporary developments in higher-dimensional spectral theory. We elucidate the fundamental theoretical frameworks, specifically the non-Bloch band theory and the concept of the Generalized Brillouin Zone (GBZ), which resolve the breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we critically examine state-of-the-art advancements, including the algebraic skin effect, geometry-dependent localization, and hybrid skin-topological phases. The review surveys transformative applications in photonics, acoustics, and electric circuits, highlighting the use of NHSE for enhanced sensing and lasing. Finally, we identify persistent challenges in higher-dimensional classifications and many-body interactions, outlining a roadmap for future research in non-Hermitian physics.\n\n---",

      "content": "The study of topological phases of matter has traditionally relied on the assumption of Hermiticity, which guarantees real energy spectra and orthogonal eigenstates, reflecting the conservation of probability in isolated quantum systems. However, physical systems are rarely truly isolated; they exchange energy and particles with their environment. In recent years, the focus of condensed matter physics and photonics has expanded to include non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which effectively describe open systems featuring gain, loss, and non-reciprocal couplings [cite: 1, 2].\n\nWithin this non-Hermitian framework, a striking phenomenon has emerged that has no counterpart in Hermitian physics: the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect (NHSE). In systems exhibiting NHSE, the bulk eigenstates—which would be extended Bloch waves under periodic boundary conditions (PBC)—undergo a drastic restructuring under open boundary conditions (OBC), becoming exponentially localized at the system's edges [cite: 3, 4]. This localization is not a trivial edge effect but a macroscopic accumulation of the bulk modes themselves, scaling with the system size.\n\nThe discovery of the NHSE has necessitated a fundamental re-evaluation of band theory. It demonstrates that the energy spectrum of a non-Hermitian system is hypersensitive to boundary conditions, leading to the breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) that underpins topological insulators [cite: 3, 5]. The motivation for studying NHSE extends beyond theoretical curiosity; it promises a new generation of devices capable of unidirectional transport, light funneling, and sensing sensitivities that scale exponentially with system size [cite: 6, 7].\n\nThis review aims to provide a rigorous and comprehensive synthesis of the NHSE literature. We will explore the theoretical underpinnings that replaced the standard Brillouin zone with the Generalized Brillouin Zone (GBZ), examine the rich phenomenology in higher dimensions, and evaluate the practical applications that have been realized in experimental platforms ranging from topoelectric circuits to photonic crystals.\n\n---",

In non-Hermitian systems, this principle often fails. The spectrum under PBC can differ drastically from the spectrum under OBC. For instance, the PBC spectrum may form loops in the complex energy plane, while the OBC spectrum collapses into lines or arcs within the interior of those loops [cite: 2, 8]. This spectral collapse is the spectral signature of the NHSE.",

The NHSE is intrinsically linked to non-trivial point-gap topology.

This includes \"dynamical skin effects\" where the localization emerges or oscillates in time, and the study of relaxation times in open quantum systems. Phenomena like the \"non-Hermitian edge burst\" and \"dynamic sticky effect\" are recent discoveries that require further exploration [cite: 37].\n\n---",

      "content": "The Non-Hermitian Skin Effect has rapidly evolved from a theoretical curiosity to a cornerstone of modern non-Hermitian physics. By invalidating the traditional Bloch band theory, it has forced the development of the Generalized Brillouin Zone and non-Bloch band theory, enriching our understanding of spectral topology. The field has matured to include higher-dimensional phenomena, such as the geometry-dependent and algebraic skin effects, and has found robust experimental validation across diverse platforms.\n\nThe implications of the NHSE are profound. It provides a mechanism for macroscopic energy concentration, enabling exponentially sensitive sensors and highly efficient lasers. However, significant challenges remain in unifying the theory across dimensions and incorporating many-body interactions. As research moves toward quantum metrology and nonlinear regimes, the NHSE promises to remain a fertile ground for discovering novel phases of matter and engineering next-generation wave-based technologies.\n\n---",
