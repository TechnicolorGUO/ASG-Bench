This review provides a comprehensive systematic analysis of heavy–heavy hadronic molecules, synthesizing theoretical predictions, experimental observations, and methodological advancements. We focus on the seminal survey by Dong, Guo, and Zou (2021) and subsequent literature, examining the application of Heavy Quark Spin Symmetry (HQSS), One-Boson-Exchange (OBE) models, and Lattice QCD to these systems. While the heavy-antiheavy sector (e.g., $X(3872)$) is well-established, the heavy–heavy sector offers a unique testing ground for exotic hadron structure due to the absence of annihilation channels and the presence of distinct heavy diquark dynamics. This paper reviews the predicted spectrum of $DD^*$, $BB^*$, and heavy dibaryon molecules, analyzes the stability of the doubly-bottom $T_{bb}$ state, and identifies key challenges in distinguishing molecular configurations from compact tetraquarks.\n\n---",

These states, often referred to as the $XYZ$ particles, do not fit neatly into the traditional multiplets [cite: 1, 2]. Among the proposed interpretations for these exotics, the **hadronic molecule** hypothesis—where two color-singlet hadrons are bound by residual strong forces, analogous to the deuteron—has gained significant traction [cite: 2, 3].\n\nWhile the heavy-antiheavy sector ($Q\\bar{Q}$) has been extensively studied following the discovery of the $X(3872)$ (also known as $\\chi_{c1}(3872)$), the **heavy–heavy** sector ($QQ$) has historically received less attention [cite: 3, 4]. However, heavy–heavy systems are theoretically pristine; unlike $Q\\bar{Q}$ systems, $QQ$ systems cannot annihilate into gluons or light quarks, potentially leading to narrower, more stable states that provide unambiguous signatures of exotic structure [cite: 5, 6].",

In this picture, the quarks are confined within a single hadronic volume [cite: 1, 12].",

These systems may exhibit Efimov physics (universal binding independent of short-range details) [cite: 30].\n*   **Precision Lattice QCD:** Future lattice calculations must move towards physical pion masses and finer lattice spacings to resolve the shallow binding of the $T_{cc}$ and the precise mass of the $T_{bb}$ [cite: 10, 26].\n*   **Weak Decay Phenomenology:** Detailed calculations of the weak decay widths and branching ratios of the $T_{bb}$ and $T_{bc}$ are needed to guide experimental search strategies [cite: 6, 14].\n\n---",

      "content": "The study of heavy–heavy hadronic molecules has transitioned from speculative theoretical models to a data-driven field following the discovery of the $T_{cc}^+(3875)$. The comprehensive surveys, particularly by Dong, Guo, and Zou, have successfully established a framework based on Heavy Quark Spin Symmetry and One-Boson-Exchange that not only explains the $T_{cc}^+$ but predicts a rich spectrum of doubly-heavy mesons and baryons.\n\nThe existence of the $T_{cc}^+$ as a shallow, near-threshold molecule strongly implies the existence of a deeply bound, stable $T_{bb}$ partner. This state represents a unique laboratory for QCD: a stable hadron composed of four quarks. While challenges remain in disentangling molecular and compact components and in the experimental detection of heavier states, the heavy–heavy sector stands as one of the most promising avenues for understanding the non-perturbative dynamics of the strong interaction. The era of precision spectroscopy for doubly heavy hadrons has just begun.\n\n---",
