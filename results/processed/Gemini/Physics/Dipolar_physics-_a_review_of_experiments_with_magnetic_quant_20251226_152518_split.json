This review provides a comprehensive systematic analysis of experimental progress in magnetic quantum gases, tracing the evolution from the first Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of chromium to the recent proliferation of lanthanide experiments (dysprosium, erbium, thulium, and europium). We examine the fundamental properties of dipolar gases, including the competition between contact and dipolar interactions, and the stabilization of dense phases via quantum fluctuations. Key milestones are critically analyzed, including the observation of Fermi surface deformation, the realization of extended Bose-Hubbard models, and the discovery of quantum droplets and supersolid states. Special attention is given to the very recent observation of quantized vortices in dipolar supersolids (2024), which provides hydrodynamic evidence of superfluidity in a modulated phase. We conclude by identifying current challenges and outlining future research directions in dipolar mixtures and quantum simulation.",

For the first decade, these experiments were dominated by alkali atoms, where the interatomic interaction is isotropic and short-range, effectively described by a contact potential characterized by the s-wave scattering length $a_s$. However, the desire to simulate more complex condensed matter systems and explore exotic quantum phases necessitated the introduction of long-range, anisotropic interactions [cite: 1, 2].\n\nMagnetic quantum gases—comprising atoms with large permanent magnetic dipole moments in their electronic ground state—have emerged as the leading platform for exploring such physics. Unlike alkali atoms, which typically have magnetic moments of $\\approx 1 \\mu_B$ (Bohr magneton), highly magnetic species such as chromium ($6 \\mu_B$), erbium ($7 \\mu_B$), and dysprosium ($10 \\mu_B$) exhibit significant dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) [cite: 2, 3]. The DDI is fundamentally different from the contact interaction: it is long-range (decaying as $1/r^3$) and anisotropic (depending on the orientation of the dipoles relative to the interatomic separation vector).\n\nThis review aims to synthesize the rapid experimental developments in this field. We are motivated by the recent explosion of results, including the stabilization of quantum droplets by beyond-mean-field effects and the long-sought observation of supersolidity—a paradoxical state of matter possessing both crystalline order and superfluid flow [cite: 4, 5]. We further address the expansion of the \"dipolar periodic table\" to include thulium and europium, and the application of these systems to simulate phenomena ranging from extended Hubbard models to neutron star glitches [cite: 6, 7, 8].",
