As of late 2025, the tension stands between $4\\sigma$ and $6\\sigma$, depending on the specific datasets and calibration methods employed. This review provides a comprehensive systematic analysis of the field, building upon the foundational \"H0 Olympics\" and the seminal 2021 review by Di Valentino et al., while integrating pivotal developments from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We categorize proposed solutions into early-time modifications (e.g., Early Dark Energy, New Early Dark Energy), late-time extensions (e.g., Phantom Dark Energy, Interacting Dark Sectors), and observational systematics. Special attention is given to the \"S8 tension\" trade-off, where solutions to $H_0$ often exacerbate discrepancies in matter clustering. We conclude that while no single theoretical model has yet emerged as a definitive successor to $\\Lambda$CDM, recent observational data from DESI hinting at dynamical dark energy, combined with high-precision JWST calibrations, suggest the resolution may lie in a combination of new physics and refined local measurements.",

However, as precision cosmology has entered the era of sub-percent accuracy, a formidable crack in this edifice has emerged: the Hubble tension.\n\nThe tension is defined by the disagreement between two distinct methods of determining the current expansion rate of the Universe, $H_0$. The \"indirect\" method involves measuring the physics of the early Universe (primarily the CMB) and extrapolating forward in time using the $\\Lambda$CDM model. The Planck Collaboration (2018) provides the benchmark for this, yielding $H_0 = 67.4 \\pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ [cite: 1, 2]. The \"direct\" method, or the local distance ladder, uses standard candles (Cepheids, Type Ia Supernovae) to measure the expansion rate in the late Universe without assuming a cosmological model. The SH0ES (Supernova, H0, for the Equation of State of Dark Energy) collaboration, utilizing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry, has consistently found a higher value, clustering around $H_0 \\approx 73$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ [cite: 1, 3].\n\nBy 2021, this discrepancy had crossed the $5\\sigma$ threshold, rendering it effectively impossible to dismiss as a statistical fluctuation [cite: 4, 5]. This prompted a massive theoretical effort to modify $\\Lambda$CDM, resulting in hundreds of proposed \"solutions.\" This review aims to synthesize these efforts, updating the landscape with the crucial observational breakthroughs of 2024 and 2025, particularly the release of DESI Year 1 data and JWST's scrutiny of the Cepheid distance scale.",

The \"H0 Olympics\" established that while early-time solutions like EDE are the most promising theoretical candidates, they come at the cost of increased complexity and tension with large-scale structure data ($S_8$).\n\nHowever, the observational developments of 2024–2025 have introduced a new paradigm. The JWST results from the CCHP suggest that the local $H_0$ might be lower (~70 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$) than previously thought, reducing the statistical significance of the tension. Simultaneously, DESI has provided the first strong evidence that Dark Energy may be dynamical rather than constant.\n\nWe are likely approaching a convergence point. If future JWST data confirms the lower CCHP value and DESI confirms dynamical dark energy, the \"Hubble Tension\" may dissolve into a combination of modest new physics (dynamical DE) and corrected systematics. Conversely, if SH0ES is correct and $H_0 \\approx 73$, the failure of current models to simultaneously solve $H_0$ and $S_8$ suggests that our theoretical imagination—perhaps regarding the nature of gravity or the dark sector—is still missing a critical piece of the puzzle.",
