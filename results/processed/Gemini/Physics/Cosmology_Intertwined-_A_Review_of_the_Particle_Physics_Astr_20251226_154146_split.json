We focus primarily on the $5\\sigma$ discordance in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) between early- and late-universe probes and the persistent $2\\text{--}3\\sigma$ tension in the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($S_8$). We synthesize findings from the recent Snowmass 2021 process and subsequent literature through 2025, including pivotal updates from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We critically evaluate proposed solutions arising from particle physics and modified gravity, such as Early Dark Energy (EDE), interacting dark sectors, and curvature anomalies. The review concludes that these tensions likely signal the necessity for new physics beyond the standard model rather than mere systematic errors.",

The standard cosmological model, $\\Lambda$CDM, assumes a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant ($\\Lambda$) and Cold Dark Matter (CDM), governed by General Relativity. This model successfully fits a wide array of data, from the temperature anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to the distribution of large-scale structures (LSS) [cite: 1, 2].\n\nHowever, the \"precision cosmology\" era has birthed \"tension cosmology.\" The most statistically significant challenge is the Hubble tension: a discrepancy between the value of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the early Universe (assuming $\\Lambda$CDM) and the value measured directly in the local Universe [cite: 1, 3]. Simultaneously, a separate tension has arisen regarding the clumpiness of the Universe, quantified by the parameter $S_8$, where weak lensing surveys prefer a lower value than that predicted by the CMB [cite: 4, 5].\n\nThese discrepancies are not merely statistical curiosities; they are \"intertwined\" with fundamental questions in particle physics and astrophysics. They challenge our understanding of the nature of dark energy, the properties of neutrinos, and the validity of General Relativity on cosmic scales [cite: 1, 6]. This review aims to synthesize the current state of these tensions, incorporating the latest observational milestones from 2024 and 2025, and to categorize the theoretical attempts to resolve them.",
