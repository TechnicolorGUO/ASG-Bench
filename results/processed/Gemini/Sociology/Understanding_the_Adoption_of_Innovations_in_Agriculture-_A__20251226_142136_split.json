      "content": "The adoption of agricultural innovations is a critical driver for global food security, economic development, and environmental sustainability. However, the rate of adoption for many beneficial technologies remains suboptimal. This systematic literature review examines the theoretical landscape of agricultural adoption, synthesizing insights from over 70 years of research. It critically analyzes selected conceptual models ranging from foundational theories like the Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) and economic constraint models to contemporary frameworks such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and the Adoption and Diffusion Outcome Prediction Tool (ADOPT). The review highlights the transition from linear, individualistic decision-making models to systemic approaches that account for institutional contexts and social networks. Key findings indicate that while psychological constructs (attitude, intent) are strong predictors of behavior, they must be integrated with economic and environmental variables to be effective in agricultural contexts. The paper concludes by identifying research gaps, particularly regarding the \"pro-innovation bias\" and the need for longitudinal studies on discontinuance, offering a roadmap for future research to bridge the gap between innovation potential and on-farm reality.\n\n---",

Innovation, ranging from precision agriculture technologies to sustainable land management practices, is widely viewed as the primary mechanism to address these challenges. However, a persistent \"adoption gap\" exists where scientifically proven technologies fail to achieve widespread use among farmers [cite: 2].\n\nThis gap represents not only a failure of return on investment for research and development (R&D) but also a missed opportunity for improving rural livelihoods and ecological resilience. Understanding the decision-making processes of farmers is therefore paramount. Agricultural extension services and policymakers rely on theoretical models to design interventions; however, the literature is fragmented across disciplines including rural sociology, agricultural economics, social psychology, and marketing [cite: 1, 3].",

This review has highlighted that no single model is sufficient to explain the multifaceted nature of farmer decision-making.\n\n*   **Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations** remains the foundational vocabulary (Relative Advantage, Compatibility).\n*   **Psychological models (TPB, TAM, UTAUT)** provide necessary depth on the internal cognitive processes and are increasingly vital for digital and environmental innovations.\n*   **Systemic models (AIS, ADOPT)** offer the necessary breadth, accounting for the external environment and the characteristics of the technology itself.\n\nThe field's greatest weakness remains the fragmentation of these approaches and the persistent pro-innovation bias. Future progress lies in integrative frameworks that respect the rationality of non-adoption and account for the structural constraints of the farming environment. By refining these conceptual models, researchers and policymakers can better design interventions that bridge the gap between scientific potential and on-farm reality, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and productive agricultural future.\n\n---",
