      "content": "**Abstract**\nThe rapid financialization of housing in the post-2008 global economy has transformed residential real estate from a shelter-based commodity into a premier asset class for global capital. Despite this transformation, academic and policy discourse frequently homogenizes the actors driving these changes, often referring to them simply as \"investors.\" This systematic literature review challenges the notion that residential property investors are \"one and the same.\" By synthesizing literature from urban planning, economics, sociology, and geography, this paper establishes a comprehensive typology of investor actors, ranging from \"mom-and-pop\" landlords to transnational Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). The review critically analyzes the historical evolution from \"Financialization 1.0\" (distressed asset speculation) to \"Financialization 2.0\" (long-term yield seeking), evaluates state-of-the-art methodologies for piercing the corporate veil of limited liability companies (LLCs), and assesses the divergent impacts of investor types on housing affordability and tenant stability. The findings underscore that acknowledging investor heterogeneity is not merely a taxonomical exercise but a prerequisite for effective housing policy and urban governance.\n\n---",

      "content": "The global housing crisis, characterized by spiraling affordability issues and the decoupling of housing prices from local incomes, has precipitated a surge in academic interest regarding the actors who own and manage the city. Since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008, residential real estate has increasingly been treated as a financial asset, a process widely termed the \"financialization of housing\" [cite: 1, 2]. However, a recurring critique within this burgeoning field is the tendency to treat the \"investor\" as a monolithic entity. As noted in the seminal work by Özogul and Tasan-Kok (2020), scholars often utilize the term \"investor\" in a generic manner, obscuring the profound differences between a local amateur landlord and a global private equity firm [cite: 2, 3].\n\nThis lack of differentiation—treating all capital flows as \"one and the same\"—has significant implications. It hampers the ability of policymakers to design targeted interventions, as regulations suitable for institutional investors may be ineffective or counterproductive for small-scale owners [cite: 1, 4]. Furthermore, it obscures the specific mechanisms through which different types of investors influence urban morphology, neighborhood demographics, and tenant wellbeing [cite: 5, 6].\n\nThis paper provides a comprehensive systematic literature review of residential property investor types. It aims to:\n1.  Deconstruct the \"investor\" category into a nuanced typology based on scale, motivation, and operational behavior.\n2.  Trace the historical trajectory of investor emergence, particularly the shift from speculative to institutional dominance.\n3.  Evaluate state-of-the-art methodologies, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) and automated valuation models, used to identify beneficial owners behind opaque corporate structures.\n4.  Identify critical research gaps regarding the intersection of investor heterogeneity and urban governance.\n\n---",

How are \"platform investors\" distinct from traditional landlords in their spatial strategies and impact on housing supply? [cite: 17].\n3.  **Global South Financialization:** Most literature focuses on North America and Western Europe. Research is needed on how global investor typologies apply to the \"new real estate frontiers\" in the Global South, where informal tenure systems interact with global capital flows [cite: 18].\n4.  **Algorithmic Management:** Investigating how the use of PropTech and automated management systems by large investors influences the landlord-tenant relationship and housing access [cite: 27].\n\n---",

      "content": "The literature on residential property investors has matured significantly, moving from a homogenized view of \"the investor\" to a recognition of a complex, segmented ecosystem of actors. The systematic review confirms that investors are far from \"one and the same\" [cite: 2]. They differ fundamentally in their capital sources, time horizons, risk appetites, and social behaviors.\n\nThe transition from Financialization 1.0 to 2.0 signifies a structural entrenchment of institutional capital in housing systems globally. However, the persistence of small-scale and \"accidental\" landlords ensures that the market remains heterogeneous. Methodological innovations, particularly in data science and NLP, are finally allowing researchers to pierce the corporate veil and map the true geography of ownership [cite: 25].\n\nUltimately, recognizing investor heterogeneity is critical for the \"right to the city.\" Effective housing policy cannot rely on blunt instruments; it requires nuanced regulations that address the specific incentives and risks posed by different investor types. As housing continues to serve as a primary vehicle for global capital accumulation, the academic and policy community must remain vigilant in monitoring *who* owns the city and *how* they manage it.\n\n---",
