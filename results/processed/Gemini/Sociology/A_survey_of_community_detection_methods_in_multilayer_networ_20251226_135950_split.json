Community detection—the identification of densely connected groups of nodes—remains a fundamental task in network science, yet it faces unique challenges in the multilayer context due to the heterogeneity and interdependence of layers. This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive examination of community detection methods in multilayer networks. We synthesize foundational concepts, trace the historical transition from monoplex to multiplex methodologies, and critically analyze the current state-of-the-art, including the rapid emergence of Deep Learning (DL) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches. Furthermore, we evaluate benchmarking frameworks, specifically the evolution from the LFR to the mABCD models, and discuss applications in neuroscience, finance, and social media. The paper concludes by identifying critical research gaps, particularly regarding robustness, scalability, and the handling of bipartite multilayer structures.\n\n---",

      "content": "Network science has emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling complex systems across sociology, biology, and computer science [cite: 1, 2]. Traditionally, these systems were represented as single-layer (monoplex) networks, where nodes represent entities and edges represent a single type of relationship. However, real-world systems are rarely this simple; they often involve multiple, distinct types of interactions, time-varying connections, or hierarchical subsystems. To address this, the field has shifted toward **multilayer networks**, which allow for the representation of diverse interactions as separate but interconnected layers [cite: 2, 3].\n\nA central focus of network analysis is **community detection** (or graph clustering), which aims to partition the network into groups of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the network [cite: 1, 4]. While community detection in single-layer networks is a mature field with established algorithms like the Louvain method and spectral clustering, these traditional algorithms often fail to capture the rich, complementary information present in multilayer structures [cite: 1, 3].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the rapid proliferation of multilayer network research and the concurrent explosion of deep learning techniques applied to graph data. Recent surveys have highlighted the \"untapped potential\" of this field, noting that despite significant strides, the area remains underexplored regarding robustness and unified frameworks [cite: 2, 5]. This paper aims to provide a rigorous, academic overview of the field, categorizing methods into direct, indirect, and learning-based approaches, while critically assessing their strengths and limitations.\n\n---",

Practical scenarios often involve **multilayer bipartite networks** (e.g., user-item interactions across different domains). Existing algorithms for undirected networks are not directly applicable, necessitating new models like the degree-corrected stochastic co-block model [cite: 43].\n4.  **Parameter Sensitivity:** Methods like multislice modularity rely on coupling parameters (\\( \\omega \\)) that significantly influence the resulting partition.
