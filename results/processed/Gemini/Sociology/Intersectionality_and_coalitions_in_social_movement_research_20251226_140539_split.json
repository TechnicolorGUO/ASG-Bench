Originating from Black feminist legal theory, intersectionality has evolved into a critical paradigm for understanding how overlapping systems of power shape collective action. This paper surveys the historical development of the field, distinguishes between structural and political intersectionality, and evaluates state-of-the-art methodological approaches, ranging from ethnographic discourse analysis to novel quantitative techniques like network analysis and multilevel modeling. Through an analysis of diverse case studies—including the Women’s March, Black Lives Matter, and labor movements in the Global South—this review identifies the mechanisms through which intersectional solidarity is constructed or inhibited. The paper concludes by highlighting persistent challenges in quantitative operationalization and offering future research directions regarding digital activism and the decentering of Global North epistemologies.\n\n---",

For decades, social movement scholarship struggled to account for these internal heterogeneities, often treating movements as unitary actors or prioritizing a single axis of oppression. However, the integration of **intersectionality**—the understanding that systems of oppression are interlocking and mutually reinforcing—has fundamentally reshaped the study of contentious politics [cite: 1, 2].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the increasing necessity to understand how diverse groups form political alliances in an era of fragmented identity politics. As Silke Roth argues, intersectionality matters for all social movements, not merely as a descriptor of identity, but as both an analytic tool and a political strategy for coalition building [cite: 1]. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of how intersectionality is operationalized in social movement research. It explores how \"political intersectionality\" facilitates or hinders coalitions, how researchers measure these dynamics, and where the field is heading.",

For instance, an analysis of the \"New Rights Agenda\" in Uruguay used network surveys to visualize how feminist, LGBTQ+, and Afro-descendant organizations formed an integrated structure with specific \"bridge-builder\" organizations [cite: 22]. Similarly, Twitter hashtag analysis (#BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo) uses network co-occurrence to visualize digital coalitions [cite: 16].\n*   **Decision Trees (CART/CHAID):** These data-driven methods identify which intersections of identity are most predictive of an outcome (e.g., participation in protests) without imposing a priori assumptions about which categories matter most [cite: 21].",
