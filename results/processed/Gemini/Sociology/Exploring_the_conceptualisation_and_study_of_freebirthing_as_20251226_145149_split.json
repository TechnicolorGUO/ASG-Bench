      "content": "**Objective:** This systematic literature review explores the conceptualisation of freebirthing (intentional unassisted childbirth) as a complex historical and social phenomenon. It aims to synthesize diverse research traditions—ranging from midwifery and sociology to law and bioethics—to understand why women in high-income countries choose to birth without medical assistance despite the availability of maternity care.\n**Methods:** A meta-narrative approach was utilized to trace the development of freebirth research from 1950s activist literature to contemporary digital ethnographies.\n**Results:** The review identifies freebirth not merely as a rejection of medical safety, but as a proactive response to obstetric violence, a reclamation of bodily autonomy, and a pursuit of undisturbed physiological birth. Historical analysis reveals a shift from the \"husband-wife\" birth philosophies of the mid-20th century to the radicalized, algorithm-driven \"birth keeper\" movements of the 2020s.\n**Conclusion:** Freebirthing represents a critical collision between the technocratic model of birth and the holistic/social model. Future research must bridge the gap between safety surveillance and the human rights of birthing people, focusing on how systemic failures in maternity care drive women toward unassisted birth.\n\n***",

This practice, known as \"freebirthing\" or \"unassisted childbirth\" (UC), challenges the dominant biomedical hegemony that views hospital birth as the only safe standard [cite: 1, 2].\n\nWhile the global reduction in maternal and neonatal mortality has been largely attributed to the medicalization of childbirth and the presence of skilled birth attendants, the freebirth movement highlights a growing fracture in the relationship between childbearing women and the maternity system. The phenomenon is not monolithic; it encompasses a spectrum of motivations ranging from deep spiritual convictions about physiological birth to pragmatic responses to previous obstetric trauma [cite: 3, 4].",

First, the prevalence of freebirth appears to be rising, particularly following the disruption of maternity services during the COVID-19 pandemic, which acted as a catalyst for women seeking alternatives to hospital restrictions [cite: 5, 6]. Second, recent investigative journalism and academic inquiries have highlighted the emergence of radicalized online \"birth keeper\" communities, raising urgent ethical and safety questions [cite: 3, 7]. Third, despite the risks involved, freebirthing women report profound physiological experiences—such as the \"fetus ejection reflex\"—that are rarely witnessed or documented in clinical settings, suggesting a gap in obstetrical knowledge regarding undisturbed birth [cite: 8, 9].",

Her philosophy was one of extreme privacy and self-reliance [cite: 14].\n*   **Marilyn Moran and Husband/Wife Childbirth:** In the 1970s and 80s, Marilyn Moran advocated for \"husband/wife childbirth.\" She conceptualized birth as a sexual, intimate event that should be shared exclusively between the couple.

When requests for low-intervention birth (e.g., water birth, movement) are denied, women exit the system entirely [cite: 11].\n*   **Autonomy and Control:** For many, the motivation is not just avoiding harm but actively reclaiming the birth experience.

This stigma forces the practice underground, preventing open dialogue between women and HCPs that could potentially mitigate risks (e.g., by negotiating a compromise care plan) [cite: 1, 2, 5].",

This could involve anonymous national surveys or analyzing \"BBA\" data for patterns indicative of planned freebirth [cite: 5, 11].\n2.  **Physiological Research:** The \"Fetus Ejection Reflex\" and other phenomena of undisturbed birth warrant rigorous study. Understanding the hormonal and environmental conditions that facilitate FER could inform and improve hospital birth practices [cite: 8, 23].\n3.  **The Role of Algorithms:** Research is needed into how social media algorithms radicalize pregnant women, pushing them from natural birth interest toward extreme freebirth ideologies [cite: 7, 19].\n4.  **Bridging the Gap:** Studies should evaluate models of care that might \"re-engage\" women considering freebirth. For example, can \"high-risk\" home birth pathways or continuity-of-care models satisfy the need for autonomy while providing safety nets? [cite: 11, 30].",

      "content": "Freebirthing is not merely a fringe medical risk; it is a profound social commentary on the state of modern maternity care. The meta-narrative review reveals that freebirth has evolved from the eccentric privacy of 1950s pioneers to a globally networked movement driven by a crisis of trust in obstetric institutions.\n\nThe literature presents a dichotomy: on one hand, freebirth is a rational response to obstetric violence and a reclamation of the physiological power of birth. On the other, it presents real dangers when ideological purity supersedes medical safety, as evidenced by the rise of radicalized online communities.\n\nUltimately, the persistence of freebirth signals a failure of the mainstream system to accommodate women's desire for autonomy and undisturbed birth. Addressing this phenomenon requires not legal prohibition, which drives it underground, but a systemic shift toward respectful, trauma-informed care that integrates safety with the fundamental human right to bodily sovereignty.\n\n***",
