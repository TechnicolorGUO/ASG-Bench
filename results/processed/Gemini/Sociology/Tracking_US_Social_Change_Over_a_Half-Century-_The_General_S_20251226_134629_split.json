This systematic literature review examines the GSS’s fifty-year trajectory, analyzing its contributions to the understanding of social change, its methodological rigor, and its adaptation to the digital age. The review synthesizes findings across three major substantive domains: political polarization, religious secularization, and social networks. It further critically evaluates the survey's methodological evolution from strict face-to-face probability sampling to complex multi-mode designs necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic and declining response rates. The paper concludes that while the GSS remains an indispensable infrastructure for the social sciences, its future relies on successfully navigating the trade-offs between longitudinal consistency and the exigencies of modern survey research.",

      "content": "The empirical study of society requires robust infrastructure. In the physical sciences, this infrastructure takes the form of particle accelerators or telescopes; in sociology and political science, it takes the form of large-scale, repeated cross-sectional surveys. For the United States, the General Social Survey (GSS) constitutes this critical infrastructure. Conceived in 1971 and first fielded in 1972 by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago, the GSS was designed to fill a void in the national statistical system: the lack of high-quality, accessible, and continuous data on the sentiments and behaviors of the American public [cite: 1, 2].\n\nThe motivation behind the GSS was to democratize access to high-quality social science data. Prior to the 1970s, public opinion research was often proprietary or fragmented. The GSS, funded primarily by the National Science Foundation (NSF), was established with a mandate to monitor social trends and provide data immediately to the research community without cost or delay [cite: 3]. Over the last half-century, it has generated a cumulative dataset covering more than two generations and a century of birth cohorts, enabling researchers to disentangle the complex effects of aging, period events, and cohort succession on the American psyche [cite: 4, 5].\n\nThis review assesses the GSS at its fifty-year milestone. It explores how the survey has tracked fundamental shifts in American life—from the liberalization of social attitudes to the restructuring of religious affiliation—and examines the methodological innovations required to sustain this project in an era of increasing survey non-response.",

The sample design in the earliest years (1972–1974) utilized block quota sampling, which was subsequently replaced by full probability sampling in 1977 to ensure higher statistical rigor and representativeness [cite: 6, 7].",

This shift allowed for larger sample sizes in each round and the inclusion of more extensive topical modules without increasing the annualized cost [cite: 1, 6].\n\nCrucially, the GSS became a global model. In 1984, the GSS co-founded the **International Social Survey Programme (ISSP)**, a cross-national collaboration that now includes over 40 member countries. This expansion allowed researchers to place U.S. trends in a comparative global context, examining whether American exceptionalism holds in areas such as welfare state attitudes, religious belief, and environmental concern [cite: 1, 4, 8].",

Cohort replacement (younger, more liberal generations replacing older ones) drives much of this change [cite: 4].\n*   **Sorting vs. Polarization:** Research by Hout, Maggio, and others using GSS data suggests that while Americans' policy views have not necessarily become bimodal (extremist), their partisan identities have become perfectly aligned with their ideologies. In the 1970s, there were many conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans; today, these groups have largely vanished, creating a \"sorted\" electorate that feels more polarized [cite: 15, 16].\n*   **The \"Liberal Rebound\":** Contrary to the narrative of a permanent conservative shift during the Reagan era, GSS data revealed a \"liberal rebound\" in public opinion starting in the 1990s, particularly regarding social tolerance and government spending [cite: 4, 17].",

Starting in the 1990s, this number began to climb rapidly, reaching nearly 30% by the 2020s [cite: 18, 19].\n*   **Drivers of Change:** Hout and Fischer (2002, 2014) utilized GSS data to argue that this shift was not purely a loss of belief (many \"nones\" still believe in God) but a political backlash against the Religious Right. As conservative Christianity became linked with right-wing politics, moderates and liberals disaffiliated from organized religion [cite: 4, 20].\n*   **Demographic Inertia:** The data shows that this secularization is driven by generational succession. Younger cohorts are entering adulthood with significantly lower rates of affiliation than previous generations, and they are not \"returning to the fold\" as they age [cite: 19, 21].",

Subsequent analysis, including work by Fischer (2009) and Paik and Sanchagrin (2013), suggested that the 2004 finding was likely an artifact of training effects or interviewer fatigue rather than a sudden societal collapse in sociability. Later GSS waves did not support the catastrophic isolation hypothesis, though they do show a subtle shift toward kin-centric networks [cite: 22, 23, 24, 25].
