This transformation centers on the emergence of **behaviour-based insurance (BBI)**, a model that utilizes granular, real-time data from telematics, wearable devices, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to assess risk and price premiums dynamically [cite: 1, 2]. Unlike traditional actuarial models that rely on static proxies (e.g., age, gender, postal code) to pool risk, BBI promises to price risk based on actual individual behavior—how one drives, eats, exercises, or sleeps [cite: 2, 3].\n\nHowever, this technological shift is deeply \"contested\" within the social sciences. It is not merely a technical upgrade but a sociotechnical reorganization that challenges the historical foundations of insurance: the principle of solidarity and the pooling of uncertainty [cite: 4, 5].",

Whether this results in a \"shared value\" utopia or a \"surveillance\" dystopia depends not on the technology itself, but on the social and political choices made in its regulation and implementation.\n\n---",
