This systematic literature review synthesizes the primary social theories explaining this phenomenon, moving beyond generalized prejudice to examine the specific mechanisms driving hostility toward those seeking international protection. The review categorizes existing scholarship into four dominant theoretical frameworks: Realistic Group Conflict Theory (RGCT) and Welfare Chauvinism; Social Identity Theory (SIT); Integrated Threat Theory (ITT); and Dehumanization. By integrating findings from sociology, political science, social psychology, and neuroscience, this paper elucidates how asylum seekers are constructed as distinct economic, cultural, and security threats. Special attention is given to the \"deservingness\" heuristic, the neurobiological underpinnings of dehumanization, and the emerging discourse surrounding climate-induced migration. The review identifies critical research gaps regarding the causality of threat perceptions and the efficacy of contact-based interventions in the context of securitized borders.\n\n---",

      "content": "In recent decades, the figure of the asylum seeker has moved from the periphery to the center of global political discourse. While migration is a historic constant, the specific hostility directed toward asylum seekers—often termed xenophobia or \"fear of the stranger\"—has become a pressing issue across disciplines [cite: 1, 2]. Unlike voluntary economic migrants, asylum seekers occupy a liminal legal and social space that frequently triggers distinct forms of exclusionary attitudes.\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the observation that causal models explaining xenophobia are often fragmented across disciplinary boundaries. Sociologists may emphasize structural inequalities and capitalist globalization [cite: 2], while psychologists focus on intergroup anxiety and cognitive biases [cite: 3, 4]. Political scientists, conversely, often analyze the strategic mobilization of \"welfare chauvinism\" by populist actors [cite: 5, 6].\n\nThis paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of these social theories. It draws connections between divergent models to present a comparative introduction to the social aspects of xenophobia. The objective is to understand not just the presence of hostility, but the theoretical mechanisms that transform the asylum seeker into a \"threat\" or a \"non-human\" entity in the public imagination.",

While closely related to racism, xenophobia is distinct in that it is predicated on the perception of \"foreignness\" rather than solely on biological or phenotypic markers. It manifests as a conflict between an in-group and an out-group, characterized by suspicion, exclusion, and the fear of losing national identity [cite: 7, 8]. In the context of asylum seekers, xenophobia often operates under the guise of \"New Racism,\" which substitutes biological inferiority with \"cultural incompatibility,\" arguing that certain groups cannot assimilate into the host nation's way of life [cite: 2, 9].",
