However, recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have illuminated the critical role of the mycobiome—the fungal component of the microbiota—in maintaining host homeostasis and driving pathophysiology. Although fungi constitute a small fraction of the total gut biomass (approximately 0.1%), their large cell size and potent metabolic capacity exert a disproportionate influence on the host immune system and co-resident bacterial communities. This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive analysis of the gut mycobiome, tracing its historical emergence from obscurity to its current status as a pivotal frontier in biomedical research. We critically evaluate state-of-the-art methodological approaches, specifically comparing ribosomal DNA markers (ITS1, ITS2, 18S) and multi-marker strategies. Furthermore, we explore the \"multiperspective\" nature of the mycobiome by examining tripartite interactions between fungi, bacteria, and bacteriophages, as well as the host immune signaling pathways (Dectin-1/CARD9). Clinical applications are discussed, with a focus on Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), metabolic disorders, and oncology, alongside the therapeutic mechanisms of fungal probiotics like *Saccharomyces boulardii*. Finally, we identify persistent challenges, such as the differentiation between transient and resident taxa, and propose future research directions to bridge the gap between descriptive profiling and mechanistic understanding.\n\n---",

      "content": "The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract harbors a dense and diverse community of microorganisms, collectively known as the microbiota. For decades, the term \"microbiome\" was effectively synonymous with \"bacteriome,\" as the vast majority of research focused on the bacterial inhabitants that dominate the gut in terms of abundance [cite: 1, 2]. However, the advent of culture-independent high-throughput sequencing has revealed that the gut ecosystem is a multi-kingdom environment containing not only bacteria but also archaea, viruses (virome), and fungi (mycobiome) [cite: 1, 3].\n\nThe fungal component, or mycobiome, represents a relatively small proportion of the gut microbiota, estimated at less than 1% of the total genetic material and 1–2% of the biomass [cite: 4, 5]. Despite this low abundance, fungi are increasingly recognized as \"keystone species\" capable of exerting significant ecological pressure on the microbial community and the host [cite: 5, 6]. Fungi possess distinct metabolic capabilities, produce bioactive secondary metabolites, and engage in complex physical interactions (e.g., biofilm formation) that bacteria cannot replicate alone [cite: 7, 8].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the rapid expansion of mycobiome research and the need to synthesize disparate findings regarding detection methods, cross-kingdom interactions, and clinical implications. While early studies were largely descriptive, the field is now moving toward mechanistic inquiries involving host immunity and multi-omics integration. This paper aims to provide a rigorous, multiperspective examination of the gut mycobiome, moving beyond simple taxonomic lists to understand the dynamic interplay between fungi, bacteria, bacteriophages, and the human host in health and disease.",

      "content": "To navigate the literature effectively, several foundational concepts must be defined:\n\n*   **The Mycobiome:** This term refers to the collective community of fungi (yeasts and molds) and their genomes within a specific environment. In the context of the human gut, it encompasses both resident commensals and transient species derived from the environment or diet [cite: 1, 9].\n*   **Autochthonous vs. Allochthonous:** A central debate in mycobiome research is distinguishing between *autochthonous* fungi (true residents that colonize and replicate in the gut) and *allochthonous* fungi (transient passengers introduced via food or oral/respiratory routes) [cite: 1, 4]. For example, many plant-associated fungi detected in stool may simply be dietary artifacts rather than active colonizers.\n*   **Dysbiosis:** While typically applied to bacteria, fungal dysbiosis refers to an alteration in the composition, diversity, or function of the mycobiome associated with a pathological state. This often involves a decrease in diversity and an expansion of opportunistic pathogens like *Candida* species [cite: 6, 10].\n*   **The \"Rare Biosphere\":** Fungi in the gut are often described as part of the rare biosphere. Their low abundance poses significant technical challenges for sequencing, as fungal DNA is often swamped by host and bacterial DNA, requiring specialized extraction and amplification techniques [cite: 11, 12].",

However, ITS1 may be better for specific taxa like *Malassezia* in certain contexts [cite: 21].\n*   **Multi-Marker Approaches:** A 2025 study by Orsud et al. demonstrated that single primers are insufficient for comprehensive profiling.

While historically overshadowed by bacteria, fungi are now understood to be integral players in immune development, metabolic homeostasis, and the pathogenesis of complex diseases like IBD and cancer. The field has matured from simple culture-based observations to sophisticated multi-omics analyses, revealing that the mycobiome operates not in isolation but through intricate multiperspective interactions with bacteria, bacteriophages, and the host immune system (specifically the Dectin-1/CARD9 axis).\n\nThe transition from descriptive studies to mechanistic causality is the next frontier. By overcoming methodological limitations and embracing a holistic view of the microbiome that includes the \"rare biosphere,\" researchers can harness the mycobiome for novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic interventions, such as fungal probiotics and targeted antifungal strategies. The gut is not merely a bacterial vessel; it is a multi-kingdom theater where fungi play a leading role.\n\n---",
