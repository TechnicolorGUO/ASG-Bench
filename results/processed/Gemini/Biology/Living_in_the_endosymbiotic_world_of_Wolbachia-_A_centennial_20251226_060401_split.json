As the scientific community marks the centennial of its discovery by Marshall Hertig and Simeon Burt Wolbach in 1924, this systematic review synthesizes a century of progress, from early morphological descriptions to the current genomic era. We examine the bacterium's diverse manipulations of host reproduction—most notably Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI)—and the molecular mechanisms governed by the *cifA* and *cifB* operons. The review highlights the translational leap from basic biology to applied vector control, detailing the successes of the World Mosquito Program in curbing arboviral transmission and the A-WOL consortium’s efforts to eliminate filariasis. Finally, we critically analyze emerging challenges, including resistance potential, ecological impacts, and the integration of artificial intelligence in modeling symbiotic spread, outlining a roadmap for the next century of *Wolbachia* research.",

These maternally inherited, obligate intracellular bacteria are arguably the most widespread endosymbionts in the animal kingdom [cite: 1, 2]. Residing primarily in the reproductive tissues of arthropods and nematodes, *Wolbachia* has evolved a stunning arsenal of adaptations that manipulate host biology to ensure its own transmission. These manipulations range from reproductive parasitism in insects to obligate mutualism in filarial worms [cite: 3, 4].\n\nThe year 2024 marks a significant milestone: the centennial of the initial discovery of *Wolbachia* in the common house mosquito, *Culex pipiens* [cite: 5, 6]. For decades following its discovery, the bacterium remained a biological curiosity. However, the last thirty years have witnessed a renaissance in *Wolbachia* research, driven by the realization that this endosymbiont can be harnessed to combat some of the world's most devastating diseases, including dengue, Zika, and river blindness [cite: 1, 7].\n\nThis review, titled \"Living in the Endosymbiotic World of Wolbachia,\" aims to provide a comprehensive, centennial analysis of the field. We synthesize literature regarding host range, phylogenetic diversity, and the molecular mechanisms of reproductive manipulation. Furthermore, we critically evaluate the state-of-the-art applications in vector control and agriculture, identify current research gaps, and propose future directions for the \"interdisciplinary science of this symbiosis\" [cite: 1, 8].",

Their collaboration was driven by a desire to distinguish pathogenic Rickettsia-like organisms from non-pathogenic symbionts.

However, if the female is infected with the same strain, she \"rescues\" the embryo, allowing normal development. This gives infected females a reproductive advantage [cite: 1, 15].\n2.  **Male Killing:** The bacterium kills infected male embryos during development, redirecting resources to female siblings who transmit the bacteria [cite: 9].\n3.  **Feminization:** Genetic males are converted into functional females, thereby increasing the number of transmitting hosts [cite: 1, 16].\n4.  **Parthenogenesis:** *Wolbachia* induces asexual reproduction in haplodiploid species (like wasps), allowing females to produce female offspring without mating [cite: 1, 16].",

The transition from basic observation to the protection of millions of people from dengue represents one of the great success stories of translational biology.\n\nHowever, living in the *Wolbachia* world is complex. It requires navigating the fine balance between parasitism and mutualism, understanding intricate molecular handshakes like those of *cifA* and *cifB*, and managing large-scale ecological interventions. As we enter the second century of *Wolbachia* research, the field stands at the convergence of genomics, synthetic biology, and public health. The challenges of resistance, climate change, and expanding host ranges remain, but the potential to harness this \"master manipulator\" to solve human and agricultural problems has never been greater.",
