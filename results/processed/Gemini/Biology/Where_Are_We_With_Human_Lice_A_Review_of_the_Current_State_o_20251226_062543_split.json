This systematic literature review synthesizes the current state of knowledge regarding the biology, epidemiology, vector competence, and control of human lice. We examine the taxonomic debate regarding head and body lice as distinct ecotypes rather than species and review recent genomic insights, including the extraction of ancient DNA from nit cement. A critical analysis of vector competence highlights groundbreaking 2024 findings implicating body lice in plague transmission via the Pawlowsky glands. Furthermore, we address the global crisis of insecticide resistance, the psychosocial burden of infestation, and the re-emergence of louse-borne diseases in vulnerable populations. The review concludes by identifying gaps in vector surveillance and proposing future research directions for sustainable management.\n\n---",

      "content": "Human pediculosis, infestation by blood-sucking lice, has afflicted *Homo sapiens* for millennia. Despite their ubiquity, human lice—comprising the head louse (*Pediculus humanus capitis*), the body louse (*Pediculus humanus humanus*), and the pubic louse (*Pthirus pubis*)—occupy a paradoxical space in medical science. They are simultaneously viewed as a trivial nuisance of childhood and a formidable vector of lethal epidemics [cite: 1, 2].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from three converging crises in phthirapterology (the study of lice). First, the rapid evolution of insecticide resistance has rendered traditional pyrethroid-based therapies obsolete in many regions, forcing a paradigm shift in treatment strategies [cite: 3, 4]. Second, the re-emergence of louse-borne diseases, such as trench fever (*Bartonella quintana*), in homeless populations of developed nations and conflict zones challenges the notion that these are diseases of the past [cite: 5, 6]. Third, recent molecular studies have reignited the debate over the vector potential of head lice and their role in historical pandemics, including the Black Death [cite: 7, 8].\n\nThis paper aims to provide a comprehensive \"state of the union\" on human lice. It moves beyond basic biology to integrate findings from ancient DNA analysis, genomic sequencing, and clinical trials of novel pediculicides. By synthesizing literature from 2000 to 2025, with a focus on breakthroughs in the last five years, we assess where we stand in the war against this intimate parasite.\n\n---",

While head and body lice differ in ecological niche—head lice inhabit the scalp and cement eggs to hair, while body lice live in clothing and attach eggs to fibers—they are morphologically almost identical [cite: 9, 10].\n\nCurrent consensus, supported by transcriptomic analysis, suggests they are ecotypes of a single species rather than distinct species. They share a genome that is nearly identical, and their phenotypic differences (such as the body louse's slightly larger size and distinct claws) are likely the result of regulatory changes triggered by environmental signals [cite: 1, 2]. Phylogenetic analysis classifies them into mitochondrial clades (A, B, C, D, E, F). Interestingly, head lice encompass the full genetic diversity of all clades, whereas body lice are restricted to Clades A and D, suggesting body lice evolved from head lice multiple times following the adoption of clothing by humans [cite: 1, 2].",
