Traditional models, such as immortalized cell lines and animal models, often fail to accurately recapitulate human-specific host-pathogen interactions due to a lack of cellular complexity or species-specific differences. The advent of organoid technology—three-dimensional (3D), self-organizing in vitro tissue models derived from stem cells—has revolutionized infection biology. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the methods utilized to employ organoids as host models. We examine the evolution of infection protocols, ranging from microinjection of 3D cysts to the development of \"apical-out\" polarity reversal and air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures. We critically evaluate the application of these methods in studying viral (SARS-CoV-2, Zika, Rotavirus), bacterial (*Helicobacter pylori*, *Salmonella*), and parasitic (*Cryptosporidium*, *Toxoplasma*) infections. Finally, we discuss the technological hurdles, including the lack of vascularization and immune components, and outline future directions for complex co-culture systems and organ-on-chip integration.\n\n---",

      "content": "The study of infectious diseases has historically relied on two primary pillars: *in vitro* cell culture using immortalized cell lines (e.g., HeLa, Vero cells) and *in vivo* animal models. While these systems have provided foundational knowledge, they possess inherent limitations. Immortalized cell lines often lack the cellular heterogeneity, polarization, and functional maturity of native tissue, while animal models may not support the replication of human-restricted pathogens or may exhibit divergent immune responses [cite: 1, 2].\n\nOrganoids represent a paradigm shift in biomedical research. Defined as 3D structures derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) or adult stem cells (ASCs) that self-organize into organ-specific tissues, organoids recapitulate the histology, genetic signature, and function of their *in vivo* counterparts [cite: 3, 4]. In the context of infection biology, organoids offer a unique platform to study host-pathogen interactions (HPI) in a human-relevant, physiologically active context. They allow for the investigation of tissue tropism, pathogen entry mechanisms, and innate immune responses in primary tissues that were previously inaccessible [cite: 5, 6].\n\nThis review aims to systematically categorize and critically analyze the methodological approaches for using organoids in infection biology. We focus specifically on the engineering solutions developed to overcome the topological challenges of infecting 3D structures and the application of these models across diverse pathogen classes.",

They contain multiple cell lineages (e.g., enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells in the intestine) [cite: 3].\n*   **Cellular Polarity:** Epithelial tissues are polarized, possessing an **apical** surface (facing the lumen/external environment) and a **basolateral** surface (facing the blood supply/stroma). Most pathogens infect via the apical surface. In standard organoid culture (embedded in extracellular matrix), the apical surface faces the closed internal lumen, making infection difficult [cite: 7, 8].\n*   **Adult Stem Cells (ASCs) vs. Pluripotent Stem Cells (PSCs):** ASC-derived organoids (e.g., intestinal organoids from crypts) typically represent the epithelium only. PSC-derived organoids (e.g., brain or kidney organoids) often contain mesodermal and ectodermal components, offering higher complexity but greater variability [cite: 4, 9].\n*   **Tropism:** The specificity of a pathogen for a particular host tissue or cell type. Organoids are uniquely suited to study tropism due to their cellular heterogeneity [cite: 2].",

This study demonstrated that organoids could support the replication of clinical viral isolates that were difficult to culture in traditional cell lines [cite: 12, 13].\n*   **2013:** Lancaster et al. developed human cerebral organoids, paving the way for neurodevelopmental modeling [cite: 11].\n*   **2015-2016:** The **Zika Virus (ZIKV)** outbreak accelerated organoid adoption. Researchers utilized brain organoids to causally link ZIKV infection to microcephaly, a phenotype impossible to model in standard cell lines [cite: 1, 14, 15].\n*   **2018:** Heo et al. achieved a major milestone by culturing **Cryptosporidium parvum** in intestinal and lung organoids, completing the parasite's life cycle *in vitro* for the first time [cite: 16].\n*   **2020-2022:** The **COVID-19** pandemic solidified organoids as essential tools.

Necrotic cores often form in the center of large organoids [cite: 40, 41].\n3.  **Variability and Standardization:** There is significant batch-to-batch variability in organoid generation, especially with iPSC-derived models.
