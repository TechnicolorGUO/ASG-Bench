This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current state of stingless bee classification and biology, integrating classical morphological taxonomy with emerging phylogenomic evidence. We analyze the recent taxonomic overhaul by Engel et al. (2023), which recognizes 605 extant species and 45 genera, and discuss the implications of recent genomic studies that challenge the monophyly of several Neotropical genera. Furthermore, we examine the unique biological mechanisms of the tribe, particularly the divergent caste determination strategies between *Melipona* and the Trigonini, and the sophisticated recruitment communication systems that function without the honey bee waggle dance. Finally, we review the burgeoning field of meliponiculture and the therapeutic validation of stingless bee honey and propolis, identifying key research gaps in standardization and conservation.",

      "content": "The tribe Meliponini (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Apinae), commonly known as stingless bees, constitutes the largest and most diverse group of eusocial corbiculate bees. Distributed across the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, these bees are distinguished by the reduction of the sting apparatus, which is no longer functional for defense, and the maintenance of perennial colonies [cite: 1, 2]. With a diversity that far exceeds that of the true honey bees (Apini) and bumble bees (Bombini), stingless bees are keystone pollinators in tropical forests and agricultural ecosystems [cite: 2, 3].\n\nHistorically, the classification of this tribe has been a subject of intense debate, oscillating between systems that lump species into a few massive genera (e.g., *Trigona* sensu lato) and those that split them into numerous smaller, morphologically distinct genera. The recent publication of a comprehensive review and key by Engel et al. (2023) marks a significant milestone in stabilizing the taxonomy of the group, recognizing 45 extant genera and over 600 species [cite: 2, 4]. Concurrently, advances in phylogenomics have begun to unravel the deep evolutionary history of the clade, providing new insights into their biogeography and the evolution of eusociality [cite: 5, 6].\n\nBeyond systematics, the biology of stingless bees offers unique comparative models for understanding social evolution. Unlike the well-studied *Apis mellifera*, many stingless bees exhibit distinct mechanisms for caste determination, resource recruitment, and nest architecture [cite: 7, 8]. Furthermore, the cultural and economic importance of these bees—through the practice of meliponiculture—is expanding globally, driven by the unique medicinal properties of their honey and propolis [cite: 9, 10]. This review aims to synthesize these diverse strands of research, providing a holistic overview of the field.",

Schwarz, in his monumental works (e.g., 1948), classified the vast majority of stingless bees into the single genus *Trigona*, treating morphologically distinct groups as subgenera [cite: 2, 11]. This conservative approach, while simplifying nomenclature, often obscured the immense morphological and biological diversity within the tribe.",

This supports the hypothesis of independent origins of advanced eusociality in honey bees and stingless bees.\n2.  **Generic Monophyly:** Most genera recognized by Engel et al.

      "content": "One of the most fascinating aspects of stingless bee biology is the mechanism of caste determination, which differs fundamentally from that of honey bees (*Apis*).\n\n*   **Trophic Determination (Trigonini):** In most stingless bee genera (e.g., *Trigona*, *Scaptotrigona*), caste is determined by the quantity of food. Queen larvae are reared in larger, specialized royal cells and consume significantly more provisions than worker larvae [cite: 17, 18, 19].\n*   **Genetic-Environmental Determination (*Melipona*):** In the genus *Melipona*, queens and workers are reared in identical cells with similar amounts of food. Caste determination follows the \"Kerr hypothesis,\" which proposes a genetic basis (two-loci/two-alleles) modulated by environmental factors [cite: 8]. Under this model, only double heterozygotes have the potential to become queens, provided nutrient levels are sufficient to trigger the hormonal cascade (Juvenile Hormone) [cite: 8, 17].\n\n**Epigenetic Regulation:**\nRecent research has highlighted the role of epigenetics in this process. Studies on *Melipona scutellaris* have shown differential DNA methylation and histone modification patterns between developing queens and workers [cite: 8]. Specifically, the expression of *fem* (feminizer gene) and *Am-dam* (DNA methyltransferase) varies by caste, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms link the genetic potential and nutritional input to the final phenotype [cite: 8].",

The temporal pattern of these pulses can convey information about the quality or distance of the resource [cite: 22, 23].\n*   **Piloting and Jostling:** In some species, recruitment relies on \"jostling\" (excited running and bumping into nestmates) to stimulate activity, followed by piloting, where the scout guides recruits part of the way to the source [cite: 20, 22].",
