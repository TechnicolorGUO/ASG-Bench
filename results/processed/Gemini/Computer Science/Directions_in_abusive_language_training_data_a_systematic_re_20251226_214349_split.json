However, the efficacy of these models is fundamentally constrained by the quality of the data upon which they are trained, adhering to the computer science axiom: \"Garbage In, Garbage Out\" (GIGO). This systematic literature review examines the landscape of abusive language training data, building upon foundational surveys to analyze the current state of dataset creation, annotation, and utilization. We critically evaluate the prevalence of sampling, annotator, and demographic biases that compromise model generalizability and fairness. Furthermore, we investigate the emerging paradigm shift toward synthetic data generation and the utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) for annotation, assessing the risks of \"model collapse\" and the circular propagation of errors. This review synthesizes findings from 2016 to 2025, identifying critical research gaps and proposing a data-centric agenda for the future of online safety technologies.\n\n---",

To mitigate these harms, the computational linguistics community has increasingly turned to machine learning (ML) and deep learning solutions. While algorithmic architectures have evolved from Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), the performance of these systems remains inextricably linked to the quality of their training data [cite: 2, 3].\n\nThe principle of \"Garbage In, Garbage Out\" (GIGO) posits that flawed, biased, or poor-quality input data inevitably produces unreliable output, regardless of the sophistication of the processing algorithm [cite: 4, 5]. In the context of abusive language detection, \"garbage\" data manifests as ambiguous definitions, low inter-annotator agreement, sampling artifacts, and systematic biases against marginalized groups [cite: 2, 6].",

A seminal review by Vidgen and Derczynski (2020) highlighted that creating high-quality datasets is \"difficult, laborious and requires deep expertise,\" often leading researchers to rely on flawed public datasets [cite: 2, 7]. Since that review, the landscape has shifted dramatically with the advent of generative AI, which offers new methods for data augmentation but also introduces new risks of synthetic data contamination [cite: 8, 9].\n\nThe objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive systematic review of abusive language training data, addressing the following questions:\n1.  How has the definition and taxonomy of \"abusive language\" evolved in training datasets?\n2.  What are the primary sources of bias (\"garbage\") in current datasets, and how do they affect model performance?\n3.  How are LLMs and synthetic data reshaping the GIGO paradigm?\n4.  What are the best practices for future dataset creation to ensure robust and fair detection systems?\n\n---",

(2021) found that keyword-based datasets fail to capture implicit abuse (abuse without slurs) and covert hate. Models trained on these data perform poorly on \"in-the-wild\" data where abuse is context-dependent [cite: 3, 10].\n*   **Author Bias:** A small number of prolific users often contribute a disproportionate amount of abusive content in training sets.

Traditional metrics like Cohen’s Kappa treat disagreement as \"noise\" to be eliminated. However, recent \"perspectivist\" approaches argue that disagreement reflects legitimate social diversity and should be preserved rather than aggregated into a single majority vote [cite: 21, 27, 28].\n*   **LLM Annotation Bias:** Recent experiments using LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to annotate data show that while they are cost-effective, they exhibit distinct biases.

While model architectures have achieved superhuman performance on some benchmarks, the utility of these systems in the real world is stalled by the \"Garbage In, Garbage Out\" reality. The systematic review of the literature reveals that the \"garbage\" is multifaceted: it is the bias in keyword sampling, the subjectivity of underpaid annotators, the erasure of minority dialects, and the degradation of historical data.\n\nThe widespread adoption of LLMs presents a double-edged sword: it offers tools to clean and augment data (e.g., via rewriting) but threatens to flood the ecosystem with synthetic noise that could induce model collapse. To advance, the field must embrace a data-centric ethos. We must move beyond maximizing F1-scores on flawed static datasets and toward creating living, diverse, and transparent data resources. Only by rigorously addressing the quality of the input can we ensure that the output serves the goal of a safer, more inclusive digital environment.\n\n---",
