This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive survey of graph theory’s theoretical underpinnings and its extensive applications in computer science (CS) and social networks (SN). We examine the historical trajectory from Euler’s Seven Bridges of Königsberg to the emergence of complex network science and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The review critically analyzes state-of-the-art methods, including traversal algorithms used in navigation systems and centrality measures used in social influence analysis. Detailed case studies of Google Maps and Facebook illustrate the practical scalability of these theories. Furthermore, we identify significant challenges, such as the computational complexity of massive dynamic graphs and the \"black-box\" nature of deep learning on graphs. The paper concludes by outlining future research directions, emphasizing the convergence of symbolic AI (Knowledge Graphs) with subsymbolic AI (Deep Learning) and the necessity for explainable, trustworthy graph intelligence.",

The field is currently undergoing a paradigm shift from static, combinatorial analysis to dynamic, data-driven learning via GNNs. As we face the challenges of trillion-edge networks and the demand for explainable AI, the synergy between classical graph theory and modern machine learning will undoubtedly yield the next generation of intelligent systems. The journey from the Seven Bridges of Königsberg to the \"Social Graph\" of billions is a testament to the enduring power of this mathematical abstraction.",
