This systematic literature review examines the evolving relationship between business strategy and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It synthesizes findings from over 100 academic sources, analyzing how firms integrate SDGs into their business models, the technological enablers facilitating this transition, and the persistent challenges of \"SDG-washing.\" While multinational enterprises (MNEs) like Unilever and Interface demonstrate advanced strategic alignment, significant gaps remain in Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) engagement and the measurement of substantive impact versus symbolic adoption. This paper provides a comprehensive roadmap of the current state of research, highlighting the tension between the privatization of governance and the necessity of private sector resources in achieving global development targets.\n\n---",

Unlike their predecessors, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the SDGs explicitly call upon the private sector to play a pivotal role in their achievement [cite: 1, 2]. This shift recognizes that the scale of investment and innovation required to meet the 169 targets exceeds the capacity of governments and NGOs alone [cite: 3]. Consequently, the academic discourse has moved from questioning *whether* business should contribute to sustainable development to investigating *how* these goals can be integrated into the strategic core of business operations [cite: 4, 5].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the increasing pressure on firms to demonstrate legitimacy and long-term viability through SDG alignment. However, despite the proliferation of sustainability reports, evidence suggests that corporate engagement often remains superficial, a phenomenon increasingly termed \"SDG-washing\" [cite: 6, 7]. Furthermore, the literature reveals a dichotomy: while large corporations possess the resources to align with SDGs, they often face scrutiny regarding the depth of their commitment, whereas SMEs face resource constraints despite being crucial for local implementation [cite: 8, 9].\n\nThis paper aims to provide a comprehensive systematic review of the strategic role of business in achieving the SDGs. It covers historical evolution, current methodological frameworks (such as the SDG Compass and Digital Twins), empirical case studies, and critical perspectives on the privatization of global governance.",
