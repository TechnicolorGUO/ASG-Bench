This systematic literature review investigates the multifaceted influence of AI on business value, synthesizing findings from academic research, industry reports, and theoretical frameworks. The review categorizes the literature into three evolutionary waves—predictive, generative, and agentic—and analyzes them through the theoretical lenses of the Resource-Based View (RBV) and Dynamic Capabilities. Key findings indicate that while AI offers substantial potential for operational efficiency, decision-making enhancement, and business model innovation, value realization is often hindered by the \"AI Paradox\"—a gap between investment and measurable return. This paper identifies critical enablers of value, including AI ambidexterity, data governance, and strategic alignment, while highlighting significant challenges such as algorithmic bias, talent shortages, and integration complexities. The review concludes by proposing a research agenda focused on the emerging impact of Agentic AI and the necessity of responsible AI frameworks for sustainable competitive advantage.\n\n---",

No longer merely a tool for automation or cost reduction, AI has emerged as a \"general-purpose technology\" capable of reshaping entire industries [cite: 1, 2]. However, a significant dichotomy exists in the current business landscape. While investment in AI is projected to reach trillions of dollars, a substantial portion of organizations struggle to translate these investments into tangible business value—a phenomenon often described as the \"AI Paradox\" or the challenge of \"value realization\" [cite: 3, 4].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the urgent need to bridge the gap between technological capability and strategic utility. As organizations transition from the \"digital era\" to the \"AI era,\" traditional IT strategies are proving insufficient. Leaders require robust frameworks to understand how AI influences value creation not just through efficiency, but through the reconfiguration of business models and the enhancement of dynamic capabilities [cite: 5, 6].",

Research is needed on the \"human-agent\" workforce and the role of humans as \"orchestrators\" rather than operators [cite: 12, 20].\n2.  **Longitudinal Value Studies:** Most current studies are cross-sectional or case-based. Longitudinal research is required to understand the long-term sustainability of AI-driven competitive advantage and whether AI resources eventually become commodities [cite: 5, 42].\n3.  **AI Governance as a Dynamic Capability:** Future research should investigate how AI governance frameworks (ethics, safety, compliance) can be transformed from cost centers into sources of strategic differentiation and trust [cite: 15, 43].\n4.  **Measuring the Intangible:** Developing robust econometric models to quantify the \"soft\" value of AI, such as improved innovation culture and decision velocity [cite: 14, 44].\n\n---",

The integration of AI into business strategy is best understood through the lenses of **Dynamic Capabilities** and **Ambidexterity**, where firms leverage AI to simultaneously optimize current operations and pioneer new business models.\n\nHowever, the path to value is nonlinear. The transition from Predictive to Generative and now Agentic AI offers exponential potential but introduces complex challenges regarding data governance, talent, and ethics. The \"AI Paradox\" suggests that technology deployment without strategic alignment and cultural transformation yields minimal return. Therefore, the future of AI in business lies not in the sophistication of algorithms alone, but in the **strategic orchestration** of human and machine intelligence to create resilient, adaptive, and innovative organizations.\n\n---",
