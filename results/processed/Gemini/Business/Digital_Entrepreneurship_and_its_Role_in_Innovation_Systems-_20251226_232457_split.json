As digital technologies reshape industrial structures and societal interactions, they simultaneously offer mechanisms for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and introduce new systemic vulnerabilities. This comprehensive systematic literature review synthesizes existing research to elucidate the hybrid concept of digital entrepreneurship and its catalytic role within innovation systems. Building upon foundational work by Satalkina and Steiner (2020) and integrating recent developments regarding the \"Twin Transition\" (digital and green), this paper identifies key determinants across three dimensions: the entrepreneur, the entrepreneurial process, and the ecosystem. The review highlights the dual nature of digitalization as both an enabler of circular economy models and a source of environmental and social risk. We conclude by outlining a robust agenda for future research, emphasizing the need for transdisciplinary approaches to navigate the complexities of socio-technical transformations.\n\n---",

      "content": "In the twenty-first century, the global economy is undergoing a profound metamorphosis driven by two concurrent forces: the rapid proliferation of digital technologies and the urgent imperative for environmental sustainability. This convergence, often termed the \"Twin Transition,\" has positioned digital entrepreneurship not merely as a commercial activity but as a systemic driver of change within broader innovation systems [cite: 1, 2].\n\nDigital entrepreneurship is increasingly recognized as an essential driver within the innovation system, fundamentally altering the structure, aims, and networking mechanisms of the overall business environment [cite: 3, 4]. Unlike traditional entrepreneurship, which may view technology as a support function, digital entrepreneurship places digital artifacts and platforms at the core of value creation. This shift affects various levels and dimensions of the innovation system, from individual competence profiles to regional infrastructure [cite: 5].\n\nHowever, the integration of digital technologies into entrepreneurial ventures is not without paradoxes. While digitalization provides novel business opportunities—such as dematerialization, efficiency gains, and global market access—it is also disruptive, causing new vulnerabilities including cyber threats, the digital divide, and unforeseen environmental costs (e.g., energy consumption of data centers) [cite: 3, 6]. Consequently, understanding the role of digital entrepreneurship requires a holistic view that transcends the firm level and considers the \"metasystem\" of innovation [cite: 7].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the fragmentation of current literature. While substantial research exists on digital entrepreneurship and sustainable development separately, their intersection within the context of innovation systems remains under-theorized [cite: 8, 9]. This paper aims to bridge this gap by systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art literature, categorizing key themes, and identifying research avenues that support sustainable socio-technical transitions.\n\n---",

      "content": "This systematic literature review confirms that digital entrepreneurship is a hybrid and transformative force within innovation systems, serving as a critical lever for sustainable transitions. The analysis of 52 core papers and subsequent recent literature reveals that digital entrepreneurship operates across three fundamental dimensions: the **entrepreneur** (competencies and intent), the **entrepreneurial process** (digitalization of value creation), and the **ecosystem** (infrastructure and policy) [cite: 3, 5].\n\nThe integration of digital technologies into entrepreneurship offers unprecedented opportunities for circular economy models, resource efficiency, and global market inclusion. However, this transition is not automatically sustainable. It is fraught with challenges, including the environmental cost of digital infrastructure and the risk of exacerbating social inequalities.\n\nFor the \"Twin Transition\" to be successful, future research and policy must move beyond techno-optimism. A rigorous, systems-based approach is required—one that acknowledges the trade-offs and actively steers digital innovation toward regenerative and inclusive outcomes. By understanding the interrelations between digital entrepreneurship and the broader socioeconomic system, scholars and practitioners can better navigate the complexities of the 21st-century economic landscape.\n\n---",
