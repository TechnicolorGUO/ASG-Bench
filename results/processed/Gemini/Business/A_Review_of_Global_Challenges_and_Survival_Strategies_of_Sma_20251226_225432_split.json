However, they remain disproportionately vulnerable to exogenous shocks, ranging from financial crises and pandemics to geopolitical instability and technological disruption. This systematic literature review synthesizes research spanning from early 20th-century economic theories to the post-COVID-19 landscape of 2024-2025. It critically analyzes the evolution of SME research, the heterogeneity of definitions, and the shifting paradigm of survival strategies. Key findings indicate a transition from static efficiency models to dynamic capabilities, with a contemporary emphasis on digital transformation—specifically Generative AI—and supply chain reconfiguration strategies such as friend-shoring and near-shoring. This paper identifies significant research gaps regarding the long-term viability of \"born-global\" SMEs in fragmented markets and offers a roadmap for future inquiry into SME antifragility.\n\n---",

      "content": "Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are universally recognized as the engines of economic growth, innovation, and social cohesion. In both developed and developing economies, SMEs typically represent over 90% of all business entities and are responsible for a significant share of job creation and GDP contribution [cite: 1, 2, 3]. Despite their critical importance, SMEs are characterized by a \"liability of smallness,\" possessing fewer tangible resources, lower liquidity, and limited political influence compared to large multinational corporations (MNCs) [cite: 4].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the unprecedented confluence of global challenges facing SMEs in the current decade. The aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising geopolitical tensions, and the rapid acceleration of Industry 4.0 and Generative AI have fundamentally altered the operating environment [cite: 2, 5, 6]. While historical literature focused on financial constraints and local competition, contemporary research must address how SMEs survive in an era of \"polycrisis\"—where economic, ecological, and security crises intersect.\n\nThe objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature concerning the challenges and survival strategies of SMEs. It aims to:\n1.  Clarify the definitional ambiguity surrounding SMEs.\n2.  Trace the historical evolution of SME research milestones.\n3.  Analyze state-of-the-art survival strategies, including digital adoption and supply chain resilience.\n4.  Identify open problems and future research directions.\n\n---",

An SME is defined as an enterprise with fewer than 250 employees and either an annual turnover not exceeding €50 million or a balance sheet total not exceeding €43 million [cite: 8, 9, 10].\n*   **The World Bank Group Definition:** The World Bank employs a more flexible approach, often requiring an entity to meet two of three criteria regarding employees, assets, and sales. However, thresholds vary by country income levels, and research within the Bank sometimes conflates SMEs with microenterprises, leading to inconsistencies in data analysis [cite: 11, 12].\n*   **Country-Specific Variations:** In China, definitions are industry-specific; an industrial SME can have up to 1,000 employees, whereas retail SMEs have much lower thresholds [cite: 7].

This involves studying the intersection of organizational structure and rapid decision-making in turbulent markets [cite: 17].\n3.  **AI Ethics and Implementation in SMEs:** Most AI research focuses on large firms. There is a need for frameworks specifically designed for SMEs to adopt AI ethically and securely, addressing the specific risks of bias and data privacy in smaller datasets [cite: 2, 57].\n4.  **Psychological Resilience of Entrepreneurs:** The survival of an SME is often inextricably linked to the mental health and resilience of the owner-manager.
