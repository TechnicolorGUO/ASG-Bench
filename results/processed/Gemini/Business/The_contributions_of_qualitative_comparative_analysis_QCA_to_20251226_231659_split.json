      "content": "International Business (IB) scholarship is dedicated to understanding the cross-border activities of firms, the interactions between multinational enterprises (MNEs) and their environments, and the comparative analysis of business systems. These phenomena are characterized by high levels of causal complexity, where outcomes are rarely determined by a single variable in isolation. Instead, IB outcomes—such as foreign market entry mode, subsidiary performance, or cross-cultural adjustment—result from the interplay of firm-level capabilities, industry dynamics, and country-level institutional fabrics [cite: 1, 2].\n\nDespite this inherent complexity, the methodological toolkit of IB research has historically been dominated by variance-based approaches, particularly regression analysis. While powerful, these methods typically rely on assumptions of linearity, unifinality (one optimal path), and symmetry (the inverse of a cause leads to the inverse of the outcome) [cite: 3, 4]. Scholars have increasingly argued that this reliance creates a \"mismatch\" between the complex ontological reality of international business and the reductionist epistemological tools used to study it [cite: 2, 5].\n\nQualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), developed originally by Charles Ragin, offers a set-theoretic alternative that bridges qualitative case knowledge with quantitative rigor. By viewing cases as configurations of attributes rather than bundles of separable variables, QCA allows researchers to model causal complexity explicitly [cite: 6, 7].\n\nThis systematic literature review examines the contributions of QCA to IB research. It traces the method's historical trajectory, defines its core conceptual advantages for IB scholars, reviews state-of-the-art applications across key IB domains (strategy, culture, innovation), and identifies future research frontiers. The review posits that QCA is not merely an alternative statistical technique but a distinct approach that brings empirical analysis \"closer to reality\" by embracing the configurational nature of global business [cite: 5, 8].",

IB scholars should use these methods to study the *evolution* of MNE strategies and the *process* of internationalization over time, rather than just static snapshots [cite: 19, 21].\n*   **Mixed Methods (QCA + Qualitative/Quantitative):** Combining QCA with regression (to test net effects vs. configurations) or with deep qualitative case studies (to explain the mechanisms inside the configurations) offers a robust path forward. This \"triangulation\" can enhance both the internal and external validity of IB theories [cite: 29, 33].\n*   **Focus on Necessity:** Following Richter and Hauff (2022), IB scholars should explicitly test for necessary conditions using NCA before conducting sufficiency analyses. This is particularly relevant for policy-oriented IB research, where identifying \"bottlenecks\" (e.g., minimum infrastructure requirements for FDI) is as important as identifying success recipes [cite: 14, 22].",

      "content": "Qualitative Comparative Analysis has matured from a niche methodology to a vital instrument in the International Business researcher's toolkit. By aligning the analytical method with the theoretical reality of the field—one defined by complexity, context-dependence, and multiple pathways to success—QCA allows IB scholars to generate insights that are often invisible to traditional variance-based approaches.\n\nThe literature demonstrates that QCA is particularly powerful in explaining MNE strategy, location choices, and cross-cultural interactions where equifinality and asymmetry are prevalent. As the field moves toward more dynamic applications via Panel QCA and integrates necessity logic through NCA, configurational analysis stands poised to resolve some of the most persistent ambiguities in international business theory, bringing research closer to the complex reality of the global economy.",
