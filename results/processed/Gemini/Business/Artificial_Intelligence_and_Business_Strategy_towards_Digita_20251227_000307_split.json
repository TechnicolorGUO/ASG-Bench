While early phases of digitalization focused on process automation and data digitization, the current era is defined by cognitive technologies that drive value creation, service innovation, and competitive advantage. This systematic literature review examines the convergence of AI and corporate strategy, analyzing 127 peer-reviewed sources and industry reports. We identify a theoretical framework centered on four value creation mechanisms: organizational efficiency, strategic alignment, decision-making enhancement, and service innovation. Through a critical analysis of case studies—including the successes of JPMorgan Chase and Walmart, and the challenges faced by General Electric—we highlight the necessity of aligning AI investments with organizational culture and strategic objectives. The paper concludes by proposing a research agenda focused on Agentic AI, ethical governance, and the specific challenges of AI adoption in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).\n\n---",

Digital transformation is no longer an optional competitive advantage but a necessity for survival [cite: 1]. However, despite the ubiquity of digital initiatives, success rates remain suboptimal. Research indicates that while 83% of enterprises consider AI a strategic priority, a significant disconnect remains between technological potential and business value realization [cite: 2, 3].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the \"AI paradox\": while technology offers immense problem-solving potential, organizations struggle with practical implementation due to a lack of expertise in strategically utilizing AI to create business value [cite: 4]. The shift from traditional IT strategies to \"AI-first\" transformation requires a fundamental rethinking of organizational structures, moving beyond mere digitization to the creation of cognitive enterprises [cite: 5].",

      "content": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence into business strategy marks a critical evolution in the digital transformation journey. The literature confirms that AI is no longer a peripheral tool but a central dynamic capability that drives organizational renewal, operational efficiency, and service innovation. However, the path to an \"AI-first\" enterprise is fraught with challenges. The contrast between the success of JPMorgan’s COiN and the struggles of GE’s Predix illustrates that **strategic alignment**—the harmonization of technology with business goals, culture, and organizational structure—is the determinant of success.\n\nCurrent state-of-the-art frameworks, such as the 5A and MITRE maturity models, provide necessary scaffolding for this transformation, emphasizing that technology must be accompanied by robust governance, data integrity, and cultural readiness. Looking forward, the emergence of Agentic AI presents both a massive opportunity for autonomous value creation and a significant governance challenge. Consequently, the research agenda must pivot toward understanding how to manage autonomous agents, democratize AI for SMEs, and ensure ethical, sustainable deployment. Organizations that fail to bridge the gap between AI potential and strategic execution risk obsolescence in an increasingly cognitive economy.\n\n---",
