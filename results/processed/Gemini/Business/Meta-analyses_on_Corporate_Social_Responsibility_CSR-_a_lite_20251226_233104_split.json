(2003), consistently demonstrate a positive, statistically significant correlation between Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP).\n*   **Context Matters:** The strength of the CSR-CFP relationship is moderated by institutional factors. It tends to be stronger in developed economies with mature institutional frameworks compared to developing economies.\n*   **Micro-Foundations are Critical:** Recent meta-analyses have shifted focus from firm-level financial outcomes to \"Micro-CSR,\" revealing strong links between CSR and employee engagement, job satisfaction, and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB).\n*   **Consumer Response is Nuanced:** While CSR generally builds customer loyalty and trust, demographic factors (age, gender) and the authenticity of the initiatives (perceived value vs. greenwashing) significantly moderate these outcomes.\n*   **Methodological Evolution:** The field has moved from simple vote-counting reviews to sophisticated psychometric meta-analyses (Hunter & Schmidt method) and Meta-Analytic Structural Equation Modeling (MASEM) to test complex causal mechanisms like reputation and innovation.\n\n---",

Over the past four decades, the proliferation of empirical research has necessitated the use of meta-analytic techniques to synthesize fragmented findings. This paper provides a comprehensive systematic literature review of existing meta-analyses on CSR. By aggregating data from over 50 quantitative meta-analyses, including seminal works and recent state-of-the-art studies, we evaluate the empirical evidence regarding CSR’s impact on financial performance, employee outcomes (micro-CSR), and consumer behavior. The review identifies a robust, positive relationship between CSR and financial performance, mediated by reputation, innovation, and stakeholder reciprocation. Furthermore, it highlights the emergence of micro-CSR as a distinct sub-field, confirming CSR’s role in driving employee engagement and retention. Despite these advances, the field faces challenges regarding measurement heterogeneity and causality. This paper concludes by outlining future research directions, emphasizing the need for longitudinal designs and deeper exploration of digital CSR and green innovation.\n\n---",

      "content": "The concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)—defined as the voluntary integration of social and environmental concerns into business operations—has generated a massive volume of empirical research. However, this abundance has often led to conflicting results, with some studies suggesting a \"virtuous circle\" between social and financial performance, while others argue that CSR diverts resources from profit maximization. To resolve these inconsistencies, scholars have increasingly turned to meta-analysis, a statistical method that combines results from multiple studies to estimate the true effect size of a relationship.\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the need to consolidate the findings of these meta-analyses. As noted by Velte (2022), who reviewed 54 meta-analyses, the field has reached a level of maturity where a \"review of reviews\" is necessary to understand the aggregate impact of corporate governance and CSR on firm outcomes [cite: 1, 2].\n\nThe objective of this paper is to synthesize the findings of major meta-analyses conducted over the last two decades. We aim to answer three primary questions:\n1.  Does the meta-analytic evidence support the \"business case\" for CSR?\n2.  How does CSR impact internal stakeholders (employees) and external stakeholders (consumers)?\n3.  What methodological advancements and gaps exist in the current meta-analytic landscape?",

Employees identify with socially responsible organizations, which enhances their self-concept and leads to higher commitment [cite: 7]. Organizational justice and trust are also key mediators; when employees perceive the firm as fair to external stakeholders, they assume they will also be treated fairly [cite: 15, 16].\n*   **Internal vs. External CSR:** Employees react positively to both, but \"internal CSR\" (practices directly benefiting employees) has a particularly strong effect on reducing burnout and increasing vigor [cite: 17].",
