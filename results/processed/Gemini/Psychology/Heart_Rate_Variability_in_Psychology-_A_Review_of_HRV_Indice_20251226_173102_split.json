This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of HRV research, focusing on its application in understanding the mind-body connection. We examine the theoretical underpinnings, specifically the Neurovisceral Integration Model and Polyvagal Theory, which posit HRV as an index of central-autonomic integration and social engagement. A critical analysis of HRV indices is presented, contrasting time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics, while addressing the pervasive controversy surrounding the LF/HF ratio. Furthermore, this paper serves as a methodological tutorial, outlining best practices for signal preprocessing, artifact correction, and software selection (comparing Kubios and Python-based NeuroKit2). Finally, we explore state-of-the-art applications in psychopathology, emotion regulation, and sleep research, concluding with a discussion on the integration of AI and wearable technology in future psychological inquiry.\n\n---",

      "content": "The study of the interaction between the brain and the heart has a long history in physiology, but recent decades have seen an explosion of interest within the field of psychology. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) represents the variation in the time interval between consecutive heartbeats, known as the inter-beat interval (IBI) or RR interval. Unlike heart rate (HR), which provides a static average, HRV offers a dynamic window into the autonomic nervous system's (ANS) ability to adapt to environmental and psychological challenges [cite: 1, 2].\n\nIn psychology, HRV is not merely a measure of cardiac function but is increasingly viewed as a biomarker of self-regulation, emotional flexibility, and cognitive control. A complex, variable heart rate is indicative of a healthy, responsive regulatory system capable of rapid adjustment, whereas reduced HRV is often associated with rigid, maladaptive responses, psychopathology, and poor health outcomes [cite: 2, 3].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the \"reproducibility crisis\" and the methodological heterogeneity that currently plagues the field. Despite the popularity of HRV, the analytical pipelines used to derive indices are often complex and inconsistent across studies [cite: 4, 5]. This paper aims to bridge the gap between physiological theory and psychological application by providing a rigorous review of indices, a critique of outdated metrics, and a tutorial on modern analysis techniques.\n\n---",

It posits that the heart and brain are connected via the vagus nerve in a feedback loop that facilitates organismic self-regulation [cite: 6, 7].\n*   **Central Autonomic Network (CAN):** The model identifies a network of brain structures—including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and amygdala—that regulates physiological, cognitive, and emotional responses [cite: 6, 8].\n*   **Inhibitory Control:** The prefrontal cortex exerts tonic inhibitory control over the amygdala and sympathoexcitatory circuits. When this prefrontal \"brake\" is active, the system remains in a parasympathetic state (high HRV). Under stress or threat, this inhibition is withdrawn, leading to sympathetic dominance (low HRV) [cite: 7, 9].\n*   **Psychological Correlate:** Therefore, resting vagally-mediated HRV (vmHRV) serves as a peripheral index of prefrontal cortical function. High resting HRV is associated with better executive function, emotion regulation, and behavioral flexibility [cite: 10, 11, 12].",

It distinguishes between the primitive unmyelinated vagus (immobilization/freeze response) and the phylogenetically newer myelinated vagus (social engagement system) [cite: 13, 14].\n*   **Vagal Brake:** This theory suggests that the myelinated vagus acts as a \"brake\" on the heart's pacemaker. Rapid withdrawal of this brake allows for immediate mobilization (fight/flight) without engaging the sympathetic adrenal system.\n*   **Social Engagement:** In psychology, this theory links high HRV to the capacity for social connection, facial expressivity, and prosocial behavior [cite: 15, 16].",

In fact, during slow breathing (resonance frequency), LF power can be almost entirely vagal. Furthermore, the relationship between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches is non-linear and often non-reciprocal [cite: 23, 26, 27].\n*   **Recommendation:** Recent guidelines strongly advise against using LF/HF as a direct measure of autonomic balance.

The field has matured from simple associations between \"stress and heart rate\" to complex theoretical models like the Neurovisceral Integration Model and Vagal Tank Theory, which explain how the brain and heart collaborate to navigate a changing world.\n\nHowever, the field is at a crossroads. The reliance on outdated metrics like the LF/HF ratio must be abandoned in favor of physiologically valid indices (RMSSD, HF). Furthermore, the adoption of open-source, reproducible analysis pipelines is essential for the credibility of future research. As we move into 2025 and beyond, the integration of HRV with AI and wearable technology promises to unlock new diagnostic and therapeutic potentials, potentially allowing for the early detection of neuropsychiatric disorders long before they manifest clinically.\n\n---",
