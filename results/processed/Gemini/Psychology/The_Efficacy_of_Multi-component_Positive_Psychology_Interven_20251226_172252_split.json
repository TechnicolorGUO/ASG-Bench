While single-component interventions (e.g., gratitude journaling) have been widely studied, recent trends favor Multi-component Positive Psychology Interventions (MPPIs), which integrate various strategies such as strengths use, kindness, and mindfulness into cohesive programs. This systematic literature review and synthesis of meta-analyses examines the efficacy of MPPIs based on data from Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). The review synthesizes findings regarding the impact of MPPIs on Subjective Well-Being (SWB), Psychological Well-Being (PWB), and depression. Results indicate that MPPIs yield small to moderate effect sizes for well-being (Hedges’ *g* ≈ 0.34–0.39) and depressive symptoms (Hedges’ *g* ≈ 0.29–0.44). However, efficacy is moderated by study quality, intervention duration, and cultural context. The review also critically addresses the emergence of \"Second Wave\" positive psychology (PP 2.0), the risks of \"toxic positivity,\" and the necessity for cross-cultural validation.\n\n---",

While this approach yielded significant advancements in treating mental illness, it left a vacuum regarding the promotion of optimal human functioning. The formal inauguration of Positive Psychology by Martin Seligman in 1998 marked a paradigm shift, aiming to establish a science of human flourishing that complements the traditional focus on healing [cite: 1, 3].\n\nCentral to this movement are Positive Psychology Interventions (PPIs), defined as treatment methods or intentional activities aimed at cultivating positive feelings, behaviors, or cognitions [cite: 2, 4]. While early research often isolated specific activities—such as the \"Three Good Things\" exercise or \"Gratitude Visits\"—contemporary approaches increasingly utilize Multi-component Positive Psychology Interventions (MPPIs). MPPIs are comprehensive programs that combine multiple evidence-based exercises (e.g., gratitude, strengths, kindness, mindfulness) to target broader domains of well-being [cite: 5, 6].",

Meta-analytic evidence, particularly from Hendriks et al. (2020) and Carr et al. (2023), supports the conclusion that MPPIs yield small-to-moderate improvements in subjective and psychological well-being and reductions in depression.\n\nHowever, the field is at a critical juncture. To mature, it must transcend its early reliance on simple \"happiness\" exercises and address the complexities of human experience, including suffering and cultural diversity. The transition toward PP 2.0, which integrates the \"dark\" and \"light\" aspects of life, offers a promising path forward. By addressing methodological weaknesses and guarding against toxic positivity, MPPIs can evolve from novel activities into robust clinical and public health tools.\n\n---",
