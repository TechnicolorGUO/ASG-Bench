This systematic literature review builds upon the foundational work of Pedraza-Ramirez et al. (2020), \"Setting the scientific stage for esports psychology,\" to provide a comprehensive update on the field's trajectory through 2025. By synthesizing data from recent systematic reviews, empirical interventions, and case studies, this paper examines the shift from descriptive research to applied Sport and Exercise Psychology (SEP) interventions. Key themes identified include the prevalence of mental ill-health among elite players, the efficacy of communication and cognitive-behavioral interventions, and the unique stressors inherent to the digital competitive environment. The review concludes that while the field has established a theoretical baseline, it currently faces critical challenges regarding ecological validity, practitioner standardization, and the mitigation of \"grind culture.\"\n\n---",

As prize pools rival traditional sports and viewership numbers soar, the psychological demands on players—ranging from cognitive load to emotional regulation—have become a focal point for researchers.\n\nIn 2020, Pedraza-Ramirez et al. published a seminal systematic review titled \"Setting the scientific stage for esports psychology,\" which analyzed literature from 1994 to 2018. Their work was pivotal in distinguishing esports from general video gaming and calling for empirical investigations into cognitive and game performance [cite: 1, 2]. They identified that early research was dense with opinions but sparse on empirical data, necessitating a move toward rigorous quantitative and qualitative inquiry [cite: 3].\n\nSince that milestone, the field has expanded exponentially. Recent reviews from 2024 and 2025 indicate a surge in academic attention toward affective processes, team dynamics, and health behaviors [cite: 4, 5]. The motivation for this current review is to bridge the gap between the foundational definitions established in 2020 and the applied, intervention-based research emerging today. This paper aims to critically analyze the maturation of esports psychology, moving beyond \"what is esports?\" to \"how do we optimize performance and protect mental health in esports?\"",

In esports, this is often observed in \"reverse sweeps\" (comebacks), influenced by factors such as dissonance (disruption in momentum) and fear of losing [cite: 8].\n*   **Cognitive Performance:** This encompasses the mental processes required for high-level play, including sustained attention, information processing, and executive function.
