Ensemble methods (e.g., XGBoost) now achieve up to 88% accuracy in churn prediction, and Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used as \"synthetic participants\" in consumer research [cite: 3, 4, 6].\n*   **Ethical Imperative:** Trust has emerged as the central currency in AI marketing. The \"black box\" nature of deep learning necessitates new governance frameworks to address privacy, bias, and the psychological effects of human-machine intimacy [cite: 7, 8].\n\n---",

While early applications of AI in marketing focused on logistical optimization and basic segmentation, the proliferation of big data, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) has fundamentally reshaped how firms understand and influence consumer behavior.\n\nThis systematic literature review (SLR) aims to synthesize the rapidly expanding body of knowledge in this domain. It builds upon the foundational work of Mariani, Perez-Vega, and Wirtz (2022), who provided the first integrated view of AI across marketing, consumer research, and psychology [cite: 3, 9]. Since that seminal publication, the landscape has shifted dramatically with the advent of Generative AI (GenAI), necessitating an updated analysis of the literature between 2022 and 2025.",

      "content": "The integration of AI into marketing, consumer research, and psychology has transitioned from a niche methodological interest to a central paradigm of the discipline. The years 2022–2025 have witnessed a pivot from predictive analytics, which optimized existing processes, to generative AI, which creates new realities and challenges the very nature of human creativity and agency.\n\nThis review highlights that while technical capabilities (e.g., ensemble ML, transformers) have advanced rapidly, our theoretical understanding lags behind. The \"Average Trap\" and \"Model Collapse\" represent existential risks to the discipline if researchers rely too heavily on automated insights. To advance, the field must embrace a \"Human-in-the-Loop\" approach, leveraging AI for its computational power and semantic breadth while retaining human oversight for judgment, ethics, and the interpretation of meaning. The future of consumer research is not AI-led, but AI-augmented.\n\n---",
