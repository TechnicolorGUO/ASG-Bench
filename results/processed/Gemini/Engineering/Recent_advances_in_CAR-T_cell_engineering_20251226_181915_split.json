First conceptualized in the late 1980s and achieving FDA approval in 2017, CAR-T therapy involves the genetic modification of a patient’s T lymphocytes to express a synthetic receptor that redirects specificity toward a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) independent of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) presentation [cite: 11, 12].\n\nWhile the initial success of anti-CD19 CAR-T therapies in B-cell malignancies—such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)—was unprecedented, the translation of this efficacy to solid tumors has historically been hindered by physical barriers, antigen heterogeneity, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) [cite: 13, 14]. Furthermore, the logistical complexity and high cost of autologous manufacturing have limited patient access [cite: 15].\n\nThis systematic review synthesizes literature from 2024 and 2025 to analyze the \"next generation\" of CAR-T engineering. It moves beyond the established paradigms of hematological efficacy to explore novel structural designs, gene-editing enhancements (CRISPR/Cas9), logic-gated safety switches, and emerging applications in autoimmune diseases and senolysis.",
