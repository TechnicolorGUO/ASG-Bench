      "content": "Tissue engineering (TE) aims to restore, maintain, or improve tissue function through the use of porous scaffolds that mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM). Among natural polymers, chitosan—a deacetylated derivative of chitin—has emerged as a premier candidate due to its structural similarity to glycosaminoglycans, cationic nature, and tunable degradation profile. This systematic review provides a comprehensive analysis of chitosan-based bioactive materials, tracing their evolution from simple wound dressings to complex, 4D-bioprinted tissue constructs. We critically examine state-of-the-art fabrication techniques, including electrospinning and stimuli-responsive hydrogel formation. Detailed case studies across bone, cartilage, nerve, skin, and cardiac tissues highlight the material's efficacy and the necessity of composite formulations to overcome mechanical limitations. Finally, we address the translational challenges, including regulatory pathways and standardization, and propose future research directions focused on smart, shape-morphing implants.",

      "content": "The field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) has witnessed a paradigm shift from replacing damaged tissues with inert synthetic materials to regenerating them using bioactive scaffolds that actively interact with cellular components [cite: 1, 2]. The ideal scaffold must be biocompatible, biodegradable, porous, and mechanically capable of supporting tissue growth while mimicking the native extracellular matrix (ECM) [cite: 3, 4].\n\nNatural polymers have gained precedence over synthetic counterparts due to their superior bioactivity and lower immunogenicity. Chitosan, a linear polysaccharide composed of randomly distributed $\\beta$-(1-4)-linked D-glucosamine (deacetylated unit) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (acetylated unit), stands out as the only naturally occurring cationic polymer [cite: 5, 6]. Derived primarily from the exoskeletons of crustaceans (crabs, shrimp) and fungal cell walls, chitosan offers a unique combination of properties: it is hemostatic, mucoadhesive, antimicrobial, and capable of being chemically modified to suit specific physiological needs [cite: 7, 8, 9].\n\nDespite these advantages, the application of chitosan in load-bearing tissues is historically limited by its poor mechanical strength and instability in physiological pH [cite: 10, 11]. This review aims to synthesize the vast body of literature on chitosan-based biomaterials, evaluating recent technological milestones such as 4D bioprinting and conductive nanocomposites that address these historical limitations.",
