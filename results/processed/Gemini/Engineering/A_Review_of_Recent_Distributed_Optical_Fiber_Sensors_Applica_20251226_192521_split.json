Traditional monitoring methods, relying on discrete point sensors, often fail to capture localized damage or global deformation trends in large-scale structures. Distributed Optical Fiber Sensors (DOFS) have emerged as a transformative technology, enabling continuous, real-time measurement of strain, temperature, and vibration along fiber lengths ranging from meters to over 100 kilometers. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent DOFS applications in civil engineering, focusing on developments from 2015 to 2024. We examine the fundamental principles of Rayleigh, Brillouin, and Raman scattering, and their implementation in state-of-the-art interrogation systems. Detailed case studies are presented, covering crack detection in bridges, convergence monitoring in tunnels, landslide detection in geotechnical engineering, and leak detection in pipelines. Furthermore, the review critically analyzes current challenges, including strain transfer mechanisms and data processing, and identifies future research directions such as the integration of DOFS with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Twins.",

      "content": "The deterioration of civil infrastructure due to aging, environmental loading, and natural hazards presents a significant global challenge. To mitigate catastrophic failures and optimize maintenance strategies, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has become an essential discipline within civil engineering [cite: 1, 2]. Historically, SHM relied on visual inspections and discrete sensors such as electrical resistance strain gauges, accelerometers, or vibrating wire transducers. While effective for localized measurements, these \"point\" sensors cannot detect damage occurring between sensor locations, leaving vast areas of large structures unmonitored [cite: 3, 4].\n\nDistributed Optical Fiber Sensors (DOFS) address this limitation by utilizing the optical fiber itself as the sensing medium. This technology allows for the acquisition of spatially continuous data, effectively providing thousands of sensing points along a single cable [cite: 5, 6]. The advantages of DOFS include immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI), high sensitivity, durability in harsh environments, and the ability to monitor long-distance assets such as pipelines and tunnels [cite: 1, 7].\n\nRecent years have witnessed a surge in DOFS applications, driven by improvements in spatial resolution, measurement range, and interrogation speed. Notably, the shift from static monitoring to dynamic sensing using Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) and the achievement of sub-millimeter spatial resolution using Rayleigh scattering have opened new frontiers in damage detection [cite: 8, 9]. This paper aims to review these recent advancements, categorizing them by application domain and sensing principle, while highlighting the transition from laboratory validation to full-scale field implementation.",

It is sensitive to both strain and temperature. Techniques based on Rayleigh scattering, such as Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR) and Phase-Sensitive Optical Time Domain Reflectometry ($\\phi$-OTDR), offer the highest spatial resolution (down to millimeters) and are increasingly used for dynamic acoustic sensing (DAS) [cite: 3, 10, 11].\n2.  **Brillouin Scattering:** This inelastic scattering arises from the interaction between the incident light and acoustic phonons (sound waves) in the fiber. The frequency shift of the backscattered light (Brillouin Frequency Shift, BFS) is linearly proportional to both strain and temperature. This mechanism is the basis for Brillouin Optical Time Domain Analysis (BOTDA) and Reflectometry (BOTDR), which are ideal for long-range monitoring (tens of kilometers) [cite: 5, 6, 12].\n3.  **Raman Scattering:** This inelastic scattering is caused by the interaction of light with molecular vibrations. It produces two components: Stokes (weakly temperature-dependent) and anti-Stokes (strongly temperature-dependent). Raman systems are used almost exclusively for Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and are insensitive to mechanical strain [cite: 13, 14].",

It provides exceptionally high spatial resolution (sub-millimeter) over shorter ranges (<100m), making it ideal for crack detection in concrete [cite: 4, 10].\n*   **BOTDA vs. BOTDR:** BOTDA requires access to both ends of the fiber (loop configuration) and uses stimulated scattering for higher accuracy.

A significant milestone was achieved in 2006 with the demonstration of Brillouin-based sensing over a 100 km range [cite: 17, 18].\n*   **2010s - High-Resolution Rayleigh:** The refinement of OFDR allowed for \"hair-thin\" sensing capable of detecting micro-cracks, bridging the gap between global monitoring and local damage detection [cite: 10, 19].\n*   **2020s - Dynamic and Intelligent Sensing:** The current era is defined by the adoption of DAS for real-time traffic and seismic monitoring, and the integration of DOFS data with AI and Digital Twins [cite: 2, 8].",

Soft coatings (acrylate) dampen the signal, while stiff coatings (polyimide) provide better transfer but are more brittle. The selection of adhesives and installation methods remains a critical variable [cite: 4, 32, 33].\n2.  **Temperature Compensation:** Distinguishing between mechanical strain and thermal expansion is a persistent issue, particularly for Brillouin and Rayleigh systems. While hybrid methods exist, they add complexity and cost [cite: 15, 34].\n3.  **Data Management:** DAS systems generate massive datasets (terabytes per day). Storing, processing, and extracting actionable insights from this \"big data\" in real-time is a significant computational bottleneck [cite: 2, 35].\n4.  **Durability and Installation:** Optical fibers are fragile. Ensuring their survival during the harsh construction process (e.g., concrete pouring) requires robust cabling (e.g., steel-armored cables), which can conversely affect strain sensitivity [cite: 3, 36, 37].",
