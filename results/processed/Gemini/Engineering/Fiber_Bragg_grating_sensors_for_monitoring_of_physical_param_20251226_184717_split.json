This comprehensive review systematically examines the evolution, theoretical underpinnings, and state-of-the-art applications of FBG technology in monitoring physical parameters such as strain, temperature, pressure, acceleration, and tilt. We trace the historical trajectory from Ken Hill’s serendipitous discovery to the latest femtosecond laser inscription techniques. The paper critically analyzes current interrogation methods, ranging from passive edge filtering to active tunable laser scanning, and evaluates their performance in static and dynamic sensing. Furthermore, we explore diverse applications across structural health monitoring (SHM), aerospace, and biomedical fields. Significant attention is verified to persistent challenges, particularly temperature-strain cross-sensitivity and packaging durability. Finally, the review identifies emerging research frontiers, including the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for spectral demodulation, \"Lab-on-Fiber\" technologies, and the role of FBGs in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem.\n\n---",

      "content": "The monitoring of physical parameters is a fundamental requirement across a spectrum of industries, ranging from civil infrastructure and aerospace to energy production and healthcare. Traditional sensing technologies, primarily based on resistive strain gauges, thermocouples, and piezoelectric transducers, have long served these industries. However, these electrical sensors face inherent limitations, including susceptibility to electromagnetic interference (EMI), signal attenuation over long distances, and the risk of sparking in explosive environments [cite: 1, 2].\n\nOptical fiber sensors (OFS) have emerged as a robust alternative, with Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) representing the most mature and widely adopted segment of this technology [cite: 3]. An FBG is a periodic modulation of the refractive index within the core of an optical fiber, acting as a wavelength-selective mirror. The reflected wavelength, known as the Bragg wavelength, shifts linearly in response to external physical perturbations such as strain and temperature [cite: 4, 5].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the rapid diversification of FBG applications and the recent technological leaps in fabrication and interrogation. While early research focused on basic strain and temperature sensing, contemporary studies have expanded into complex parameter monitoring, including liquid level, inclination, and vibration, often utilizing advanced materials and signal processing techniques [cite: 6, 7, 8]. Furthermore, the integration of FBG sensors into smart structures and the Internet of Things (IoT) represents a paradigm shift in how critical assets are monitored [cite: 9, 10].\n\nThis paper aims to provide a rigorous, systematic review of FBG sensors for monitoring physical parameters. It covers the theoretical background, historical milestones, fabrication techniques, and interrogation methods. It critically evaluates applications in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), aerospace, and biomedical engineering, while addressing the significant challenges of cross-sensitivity and packaging. Finally, it outlines future research directions, emphasizing the convergence of photonics with deep learning and nanotechnology.",

When a broadband light source is injected into the fiber, the grating reflects a narrow spectral band centered at the Bragg wavelength ($\\lambda_B$), while transmitting all other wavelengths.

The wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_B$) is expressed as:\n    \\[ \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_B}{\\lambda_B} = (1 - p_e) \\epsilon \\]\n    where $p_e$ is the effective strain-optic coefficient [cite: 12, 13].\n*   **Temperature Sensing:** Temperature changes ($\\Delta T$) induce thermal expansion (changing $\\Lambda$) and alter the refractive index via the thermo-optic effect.

Their intrinsic advantages—EMI immunity, multiplexing, and durability—have made them indispensable in structural health monitoring, aerospace, and energy sectors. The field has evolved through significant milestones, from the holographic inscription method to the current era of femtosecond laser fabrication and AI-assisted interrogation.\n\nHowever, challenges remain. Decoupling strain and temperature effects requires careful sensor design, and the cost of interrogation systems must decrease to compete with legacy electrical sensors in broader markets. The future of FBG technology is poised at the intersection of hardware and software: advanced \"Lab-on-Fiber\" devices will open new frontiers in biomedical sensing, while Deep Learning algorithms will enhance the resolution and capacity of sensor networks. As these technologies converge, FBG sensors will play a pivotal role in the digitalization of the physical world, serving as the nervous system of next-generation smart infrastructure and intelligent machines.",
