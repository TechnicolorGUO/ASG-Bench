This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive analysis of nanoparticles (NPs) and nanostructured materials, focusing on their synthesis, characterization, and multifaceted applications. We examine the historical trajectory of the field, from ancient artisanal uses to modern microfluidic synthesis and green chemistry approaches. The review critically evaluates state-of-the-art applications in six key domains: bioimaging, biosensing, drug delivery, tissue engineering, antimicrobial therapies, and agro-food systems. Special attention is given to the mechanisms of action, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in antimicrobial applications and the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in oncology. Furthermore, we address the pressing challenges of nanotoxicology, regulatory discrepancies between global agencies (FDA vs. EFSA), and the environmental fate of engineered nanomaterials. The paper concludes by identifying research gaps and proposing future directions for the development of sustainable, biocompatible, and \"smart\" nanostructured systems.\n\n---",

Nanotechnology, defined by the engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale, utilizes materials where at least one dimension falls within the 1 to 100 nanometer range [cite: 1, 2]. The motivation behind the extensive investigation of nanomaterials lies in their high surface-area-to-volume ratio and quantum confinement effects, which endow them with superior optical, electrical, magnetic, and catalytic properties compared to bulk materials [cite: 3, 4].\n\nThe objectives of this review are to synthesize recent literature regarding the synthesis and application of various nanomaterial types—including spherical nanoparticles, nanorods, nanotubes, and nanosheets—across diverse sectors. While the biomedical potential of nanoparticles for drug delivery and tissue engineering is well-documented, their convergence with agro-food applications represents a burgeoning frontier [cite: 1, 5]. This paper aims to provide a holistic view of how nanostructured materials are addressing critical global challenges, from multidrug-resistant bacteria and cancer therapy to food security and sustainable agriculture, while simultaneously critically analyzing the safety and regulatory hurdles that threaten to impede widespread adoption.\n\n---",

      "content": "Nanoparticles and nanostructured materials have transcended their initial novelty to become foundational elements of modern science. From the life-saving capabilities of lipid nanoparticles in vaccine delivery to the shelf-life extension provided by nanocomposite food packaging, the impact is profound. However, the field is at a critical juncture. The divergence in regulatory standards, particularly regarding food additives like TiO2, and the persistent concerns regarding long-term toxicity necessitate a cautious and rigorous approach. Future advancements will depend on a holistic strategy that combines precision synthesis (microfluidics), sustainable chemistry (green synthesis), and robust toxicological assessment to fully realize the potential of nanotechnology while safeguarding human health and the environment.\n\n---",
