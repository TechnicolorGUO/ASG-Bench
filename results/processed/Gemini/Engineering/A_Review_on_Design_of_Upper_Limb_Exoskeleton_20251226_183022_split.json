This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive analysis of the design, control, and application of upper limb exoskeletons. We trace the historical trajectory from early 19th-century patents to contemporary soft robotics. The review critically examines mechanical architectures, contrasting rigid anthropomorphic designs with end-effector systems and emerging soft pneumatic actuators. We analyze state-of-the-art control strategies, including electromyography (EMG)-based intention detection, synergy-based control, and reinforcement learning algorithms. Furthermore, we evaluate the efficacy of these devices in clinical rehabilitation for stroke patients, industrial injury prevention, and military load augmentation. The paper concludes by identifying persistent challenges regarding kinematic compatibility and human-robot interaction (pHRI), proposing future research directions in hybrid actuation and embodied artificial intelligence.",

      "content": "The human upper limb is a marvel of biological engineering, capable of complex manipulation, high-precision tasks, and significant force generation. However, this complexity makes the limb vulnerable to neurological injuries, such as stroke, and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) resulting from repetitive industrial labor. According to the World Health Organization, stroke remains a leading cause of long-term disability, often leaving survivors with hemiparesis that severely impacts activities of daily living (ADL) [cite: 1]. Simultaneously, in the industrial sector, work-related MSDs account for a significant portion of lost workdays, particularly due to overhead tasks that strain the shoulder complex [cite: 2, 3].\n\nUpper limb exoskeletons have emerged as a technological solution to these disparate problems. Defined as wearable electromechanical devices that align with the user's joints, these systems work in parallel with the human body to provide torque assistance, guidance, or load redistribution [cite: 4, 5]. Unlike prosthetics, which replace a missing limb, exoskeletons augment or restore the function of an existing one.\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the rapid diversification of exoskeleton technology in the last decade. While early systems were predominantly rigid, stationary, and designed for research, the current landscape includes portable passive vests for factory workers, soft robotic gloves for home rehabilitation, and AI-driven active suits. This paper aims to synthesize these developments, offering a rigorous analysis of the mechanical designs and control methodologies that define the current state-of-the-art.",

They provide direct control over individual joint torques and are capable of isolating specific muscle groups [cite: 4].\n2.  **End-Effectors:** Robots that attach only to the distal part of the limb (e.g., the hand). The robot moves the hand in space, and the proximal joints (elbow, shoulder) follow based on the limb's inverse kinematics. While simpler to design, they offer less control over joint-specific posture [cite: 4].\n3.  **Orthoses:** Traditionally passive devices used for stabilization. However, the line between \"active orthoses\" and \"exoskeletons\" has blurred, with the terms often used interchangeably in literature regarding powered assistive devices [cite: 6].",

A rigid exoskeleton with a fixed CoR can generate misalignment forces, causing discomfort or injury to the user.

The field is currently witnessing a bifurcation: industrial applications are favoring passive, reliable, and lightweight mechanical solutions (e.g., Ekso EVO), while medical research is pushing the boundaries of active control, soft robotics, and artificial intelligence (e.g., TIGER, Syn-ID).\n\nWhile mechanical challenges regarding shoulder kinematics and power density persist, the integration of deep learning and soft materials offers a pathway to more transparent, comfortable, and effective devices. As these technologies converge, upper limb exoskeletons are poised to transition from specialized clinical tools to ubiquitous assistive devices, fundamentally altering how humans interact with their environment, recover from injury, and perform labor.",
