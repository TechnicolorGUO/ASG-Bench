This review provides a systematic analysis of the physicochemical properties that render PDMS suitable for biomedical applications, including its hyperelasticity, biocompatibility, and gas permeability. We trace the historical trajectory of PDMS from its industrial origins to its revolutionizing role in soft lithography. The review critically examines state-of-the-art fabrication techniques, moving beyond traditional replica molding to explore 3D printing and advanced surface modifications. We present comprehensive case studies on applications ranging from hemodynamic biomodels to COVID-19 drug screening platforms. Furthermore, this paper offers a rigorous critique of the material's limitations—specifically the absorption of small molecules and hydrophobic recovery—and discusses the regulatory and translational hurdles impeding commercialization. We conclude by identifying research gaps and proposing future directions, including the development of biodegradable alternatives and hybrid manufacturing processes.",

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a silicon-based organic polymer, has emerged as the *de facto* standard for microfluidic prototyping and soft tissue modeling [cite: 1, 2]. Its rise to prominence, particularly following the advent of soft lithography in the late 1990s, fundamentally altered the landscape of Bio-MEMS (Biomedical Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems), shifting the focus from rigid silicon and glass substrates to elastomeric polymers [cite: 3, 4].\n\nThe motivation for the widespread adoption of PDMS lies in its unique constellation of properties: it is optically transparent, allowing for real-time microscopy; it is permeable to gases, essential for cell culture respiration; and it is mechanically tunable, capable of mimicking the stiffness of various soft tissues [cite: 5]. However, the translation of PDMS-based devices from academic laboratories to clinical and pharmaceutical settings has been slower than anticipated. This retardation is largely due to material-specific drawbacks, such as the absorption of hydrophobic drugs and surface instability, which complicate quantitative bioassays and long-term implantation [cite: 6, 7].\n\nThis review aims to provide a comprehensive, critical analysis of PDMS in biomedical engineering. Unlike previous reviews that may focus solely on microfluidics or implants, this paper synthesizes the material's properties with its diverse applications, while rigorously addressing the translational bottlenecks that currently challenge the field.",

Its backbone consists of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms, with two methyl groups ($-CH_3$) attached to each silicon atom. The material is typically supplied as a two-part system: a base (vinyl-terminated siloxane) and a curing agent (crosslinker containing silicon hydride bonds) [cite: 8, 9].\n\nThe curing process, typically a hydrosilylation reaction catalyzed by platinum, transforms the liquid pre-polymer into a solid elastomer. The mechanical properties of the resulting bulk material can be tuned by altering the base-to-curing agent ratio. The standard ratio is 10:1, but variations (e.g., 5:1 to 20:1) allow researchers to adjust the Young's modulus to match specific tissue types [cite: 10, 11].",

This low modulus allows PDMS to conform to non-planar surfaces and mimic soft tissues [cite: 5].\n*   **Gas Permeability:** The porous structure of the siloxane network allows for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide, a vital feature for maintaining cell viability in closed microfluidic channels [cite: 12, 13].\n*   **Hydrophobicity:** Native PDMS is hydrophobic, with a water contact angle (WCA) of approximately $108^\\circ \\pm 7^\\circ$.

These methods were expensive, required cleanroom facilities, and produced opaque, rigid devices unsuitable for cell culture.

Recent studies have utilized fumed silica-PDMS suspensions to improve rheological properties for extrusion printing [cite: 22].\n*   **3D Printed Molds:** Instead of expensive photolithography, researchers are increasingly using high-resolution stereolithography (SLA) or digital light processing (DLP) 3D printers to create the master molds for PDMS casting.
