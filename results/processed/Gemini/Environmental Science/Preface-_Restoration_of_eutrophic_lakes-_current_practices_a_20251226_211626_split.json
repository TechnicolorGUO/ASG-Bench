This systematic literature review synthesizes the current state of lake restoration science, anchored in the themes presented in the seminal preface by Jilbert et al. (2020). We critically evaluate the evolution of restoration techniques from early wastewater diversion and hydraulic interventions to modern geo-engineering and integrated ecosystem management. The review categorizes interventions into external load reduction, physical engineering, chemical inactivation, and biological manipulation, providing a comparative analysis of their efficacy, longevity, and cost-effectiveness. Special attention is given to the \"climate penalty\"—the phenomenon where warming temperatures counteract restoration efforts—and the persistent challenge of internal phosphorus loading. Through detailed case studies, including Lake Washington, Lake Trummen, and Lake Taihu, we illustrate the disparity between restoration success in deep, stratified systems versus shallow, polymictic lakes. The paper concludes by identifying future research directions, emphasizing the necessity of Integrated Lake Basin Management (ILBM), the potential of emerging nanobubble technologies, and the critical need for quantitative models that account for climate-nutrient interactions.\n\n---",

However, the integrity of these systems is increasingly compromised by eutrophication—the excessive enrichment of water bodies with minerals and nutrients, primarily nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) [cite: 1, 2]. This process, accelerated by urbanization, industrialization, and agricultural intensification, shifts lakes from clear, oligotrophic states to turbid, eutrophic states characterized by harmful algal blooms (HABs), hypoxia, and biodiversity loss [cite: 2, 3].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the urgent need to consolidate knowledge on restoration efficacy. As noted by Jilbert et al. (2020), while traditional methods like aeration and chemical inactivation remain prevalent, the field is witnessing a divergence: the popularity of biomanipulation is declining, while research into novel in-lake nutrient inactivation methods is expanding [cite: 1, 2]. Furthermore, the \"climate penalty\" poses a new existential threat to restoration success, requiring a re-evaluation of established targets and techniques [cite: 4, 5].",

This is termed the \"climate penalty,\" requiring even stricter nutrient controls to achieve the same water quality outcomes [cite: 5, 53].\n*   **Synergy:** Warming and eutrophication act synergistically; for example, in Lake Søbygaard, modeling showed that warming increases P release, necessitating a 60% greater load reduction to maintain baseline conditions [cite: 10].",

While historical successes like Lake Washington and Lake Trummen demonstrate that recovery is possible, contemporary challenges—particularly in large, shallow lakes like Taihu—highlight the limitations of current methods.\n\nThe field stands at a critical juncture. Traditional biomanipulation is declining in favor of precise chemical and physical interventions, yet no single method is a panacea. The \"climate penalty\" threatens to undo decades of progress, necessitating more aggressive nutrient reduction targets. Future success depends on the widespread adoption of Integrated Lake Basin Management (ILBM), the development of climate-resilient restoration strategies, and the continued innovation of technologies like nanobubbles and modified local soils. As Jilbert et al. (2020) emphasize, the path forward requires a seamless integration of science, management, and stakeholder engagement to protect these vital freshwater resources for future generations [cite: 1, 2].\n\n---",
