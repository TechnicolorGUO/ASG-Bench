The governance of this \"invisible\" resource has historically been plagued by a disconnect between hydrogeological science and public policy. This systematic literature review examines the evolution of groundwater management from the early engineering concept of \"safe yield\" to the holistic, systems-based framework of \"groundwater sustainability.\" We analyze the historical milestones that shaped current understanding, review state-of-the-art methodologies including socio-hydrogeology and remote sensing, and critically evaluate key case studies such as California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin Plan, and India’s Atal Bhujal Yojana. The review identifies significant gaps in the integration of groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) into legal frameworks and highlights the emergence of participatory modeling and citizen science as vital tools for bridging the science-policy divide. We conclude that effective sustainability requires an iterative, adaptive management approach that reconciles the physical constraints of aquifers with the diverse values of human societies.\n\n---",

Despite its critical importance, groundwater has long been managed through fragmented policies that fail to account for its complex physical interactions with surface water, ecosystems, and climate systems. The \"invisibility\" of groundwater—both physically and politically—has historically led to a \"out of sight, out of mind\" governance approach, resulting in acute degradation of aquifer quantity and quality worldwide [cite: 1, 3].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the urgent need to align hydrogeological science with governance mechanisms. While scientific understanding of aquifer dynamics has advanced significantly—moving from simple water balance equations to complex integrated modeling—policy implementation often lags behind, hindered by socioeconomic pressures, legal rigidities, and a lack of public engagement [cite: 4, 5]. The interaction between science and policy is often characterized by a \"communication gap,\" where scientific complexity overwhelms policymakers, or political expediency ignores scientific realities [cite: 4, 6].\n\nThis paper provides a comprehensive review of the literature surrounding groundwater sustainability, focusing specifically on the interface between scientific knowledge and policy application. The objectives are to: (1) trace the conceptual evolution of groundwater management; (2) evaluate current methods for assessing sustainability; (3) analyze global case studies to identify success factors and failures in science-policy integration; and (4) outline future research directions to address persisting gaps, particularly regarding ecosystem protection and transboundary governance.\n\n---",

Historically, this was often interpreted simplistically as pumping that does not exceed the rate of natural recharge. However, this definition is now widely considered scientifically flawed because it ignores the \"capture\" principle—the fact that pumping captures water by reducing natural discharge (e.g., to streams) or inducing recharge [cite: 8, 9].\n\n**Sustainable Yield** (or Groundwater Sustainability) has largely replaced safe yield in the scientific literature. Alley et al. (1999) defined it as the development and use of groundwater in a manner that can be maintained for an indefinite time without causing unacceptable environmental, economic, or social consequences [cite: 7, 8]. Unlike safe yield, which is often treated as a fixed number, sustainable yield is recognized as a dynamic socio-political determination that involves trade-offs between withdrawal and the preservation of groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) and baseflow to surface waters [cite: 10, 11].",

      "content": "Groundwater sustainability is not merely a physical problem of balancing recharge and extraction; it is a \"wicked problem\" situated at the intersection of complex hydrogeology, diverse societal values, and fragmented legal systems. This review highlights that the transition from \"safe yield\" to \"sustainable yield\" represents a fundamental maturation in the field, acknowledging that water management is inherently political.\n\nThe literature demonstrates that science alone is insufficient for sustainability. As seen in the Murray-Darling Basin, excellent science can be neutralized by poor governance. Conversely, the Atal Bhujal Yojana and citizen science initiatives suggest that scientific rigor must be matched with social legitimacy. The most promising path forward lies in **iterative scientific evaluation**—processes that engage stakeholders in collaborative modeling, acknowledge uncertainty, and adaptively update policies as new data emerges [cite: 4, 5, 24]. Bridging the science-policy gap requires hydrogeologists to step out of the technical sphere and engage with the social and political realities of resource management, ensuring that the \"invisible\" resource becomes visible to both policymakers and the public.\n\n---",
