Permeable Pavement Systems (PPS) have emerged as a critical component of Low Impact Development (LID) and Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS). This systematic literature review synthesizes current research regarding the hydrological, environmental, and structural performance of PPS, including Pervious Concrete (PC), Porous Asphalt (PA), and Permeable Interlocking Concrete Pavements (PICP). The review analyzes data on runoff reduction, pollutant removal efficiency, and long-term durability under varying climatic conditions. Key findings indicate that while PPS significantly mitigates peak flows and improves water quality, challenges remain regarding clogging mechanisms, long-term fatigue performance, and maintenance costs. Furthermore, recent innovations in material science, such as high-strength clogging-resistant geometries and recycled aggregate integration, are discussed. The paper concludes by identifying research gaps in life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) and the standardization of smart monitoring protocols.\n\n---",

Traditional drainage infrastructure, designed to rapidly convey stormwater away from developed areas, often results in downstream flooding, channel erosion, and the degradation of aquatic ecosystems due to pollutant transport [cite: 1, 2]. As climate change intensifies the frequency and severity of precipitation events, conventional \"grey\" infrastructure is increasingly insufficient [cite: 3, 4].\n\nPermeable Pavement Systems (PPS) represent a paradigm shift towards \"source control\" in stormwater management. By allowing water to infiltrate through the surface layer into an underlying storage reservoir, PPS aims to restore natural infiltration rates, recharge groundwater, and filter pollutants [cite: 5, 6]. Despite their potential, the adoption of PPS is often hindered by concerns regarding their structural durability, susceptibility to clogging, and performance in cold climates [cite: 7, 8].",

The literature confirms their ability to significantly reduce runoff volume, attenuate peak flows, and improve water quality. While structural limitations and maintenance requirements have historically restricted their use to low-traffic areas, innovations in material science and smart monitoring are expanding their potential applications. The documented winter safety benefits and potential for life-cycle cost savings make PPS a vital tool in the transition toward climate-resilient urban infrastructure. Future widespread adoption will depend on overcoming the strength-permeability trade-off and establishing rigorous, data-driven maintenance protocols.\n\n---",
