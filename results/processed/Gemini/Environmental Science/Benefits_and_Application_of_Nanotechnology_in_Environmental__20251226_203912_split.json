Nanotechnology, the manipulation of matter at the atomic and molecular scale (1–100 nm), has emerged as a potent frontier in environmental science, offering novel methods for remediation, monitoring, and prevention. This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive overview of the benefits and applications of environmental nanotechnology. It traces the historical evolution of the field, from Feynman’s conceptualization to the deployment of Nanoscale Zero-Valent Iron (nZVI) and the recent advent of Single-Atom Catalysts (SACs). The review critically analyzes state-of-the-art techniques, including photocatalysis using TiO2, adsorption via Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), and biogenic synthesis of nanoparticles. Furthermore, it examines specific case studies, such as the NanoRem project in Europe and US Navy field tests, to evaluate real-world efficacy.

Conventional remediation technologies, such as pump-and-treat systems for groundwater or incineration for solid waste, often suffer from high costs, low efficiency, and the generation of secondary pollutants [cite: 1, 2]. In this context, nanotechnology has emerged as a transformative discipline capable of addressing these limitations through the unique physicochemical properties of materials at the nanoscale.\n\nNanotechnology in environmental science, often termed \"environmental nanotechnology,\" encompasses three primary domains: **remediation** (cleaning up contaminated sites), **sensing** (monitoring pollutants), and **pollution prevention** (green chemistry and manufacturing) [cite: 1, 2]. The motivation for integrating nanotechnology lies in the enhanced reactivity, high surface-area-to-volume ratio, and tunable properties of nanomaterials (NMs), which allow for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants that are resistant to traditional treatments [cite: 3, 4].\n\nThis review aims to provide a rigorous academic overview of the field, synthesizing literature on material synthesis, application mechanisms, field-scale demonstrations, and the dichotomy between remediation benefits and potential ecotoxicological risks.",

These tests evaluated nZVI against microscale iron. At Hunters Point, the injection of iron slurry resulted in a rapid drop in oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) to <-500 mV, creating strongly reducing conditions that facilitated the abiotic dehalogenation of Trichloroethylene (TCE) [cite: 43, 44].\n\n*   **Case Study: Nitrastur Site, Spain**\n    As part of the NanoRem project, nZVI was injected to remediate arsenic-contaminated groundwater. The iron nanoparticles immobilized arsenic through adsorption and reduction mechanisms (converting As(V) and As(III) to insoluble As(0)).
