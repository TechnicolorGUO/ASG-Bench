This systematic literature review synthesizes current research on the environmental impacts of boating and shipping, categorizing them into physical, chemical, and biological disturbances. Commercial shipping is identified as a primary driver of atmospheric pollution (NOx, SOx, and GHGs) and the translocation of invasive aquatic species via ballast water and biofouling. Conversely, recreational boating is frequently associated with localized physical damage to benthic habitats, particularly seagrass meadows, through anchoring and mooring practices, as well as chemical contamination from antifouling paints and sewage discharge. This paper critically evaluates example management measures, ranging from international regulatory frameworks like MARPOL and the IMO 2023 GHG Strategy to technological interventions such as environmentally friendly mooring systems (EFMs) and alternative fuels. Through an analysis of case studies—including the Baltic Sea SECA, the Port of Vancouver’s ECHO Program, and Mediterranean seagrass conservation—we identify the efficacy of current mitigation strategies. The review concludes by highlighting research gaps in autonomous shipping impacts, the socio-economic adoption of green technologies, and the need for holistic management approaches that bridge the commercial-recreational divide.\n\n---",

      "content": "The anthropogenic utilization of marine and freshwater environments for transport and leisure has grown exponentially over the last century. Shipping facilitates over 80% of global trade, serving as the backbone of the international economy [cite: 1, 2]. Simultaneously, recreational boating has surged in popularity, becoming a significant economic driver in coastal regions such as the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, and Australia [cite: 3, 4]. However, this intensification of maritime activity has come at a substantial environmental cost, necessitating a rigorous examination of the ecological footprints left by vessels of all sizes.\n\nResearch motivation for this review stems from the increasing urgency to reconcile maritime economic activities with environmental sustainability. While commercial shipping is often scrutinized for its contribution to global climate change and air quality degradation [cite: 1, 5], recreational boating exerts disproportionately high pressures on sensitive nearshore habitats, often in areas of high biodiversity value like coral reefs and seagrass meadows [cite: 4, 6].\n\nThe objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature regarding:\n1.  The specific environmental impacts associated with boating and shipping, organized by physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms.\n2.  The evolution and effectiveness of management measures, from command-and-control regulations to voluntary technological adoption.\n3.  The identification of critical research gaps and future directions for sustainable maritime operations.\n\n---",

Helical screw anchors provide superior holding power with a minimal footprint compared to concrete blocks [cite: 20, 21]. Studies in the UK and Australia demonstrate that these systems allow seagrass recovery, though adoption is hindered by higher costs and user skepticism regarding safety [cite: 19, 22].\n*   **No-Anchor Zones:** The establishment of Voluntary No-Anchor Zones (VNAZ) in sensitive habitats is a common spatial management tool, often paired with the provision of eco-moorings [cite: 22, 23].",

The Baltic Sea SECA has resulted in an 88% reduction in SOx emissions from shipping since 2015 [cite: 27].\n*   **Scrubbers:** To comply with sulfur caps, many ships installed Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (scrubbers). However, \"open-loop\" scrubbers discharge acidic, pollutant-laden washwater back into the sea, creating a new water quality challenge. This has led to local bans in various ports [cite: 28, 29].\n*   **No Discharge Zones (NDZs):** In the US, states can designate NDZs where the discharge of both treated and untreated sewage is prohibited, requiring the use of pump-out facilities [cite: 25, 30].",

This review highlights that while significant progress has been made through instruments like MARPOL Annex VI and the BWM Convention, challenges remain. The commercial sector is currently navigating a complex transition toward decarbonization, grappling with the trade-offs of transitional technologies like scrubbers and the safety of future fuels like ammonia. Simultaneously, the recreational sector faces the challenge of mitigating cumulative impacts in coastal zones, where voluntary adoption of eco-friendly technologies (e.g., AMS) often lags behind ecological necessity.\n\nEffective management requires a paradigm shift from siloed regulations to holistic strategies that consider cross-sectoral impacts. Future success will depend on rigorous enforcement of existing regulations, the rapid maturation of green technologies, and, crucially, the engagement of stakeholders—from global shipping conglomerates to individual weekend boaters—in a shared commitment to ocean health.\n\n---",
