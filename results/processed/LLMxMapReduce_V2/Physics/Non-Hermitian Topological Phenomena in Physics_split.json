In Hermitian systems, topological invariants such as the Chern number or the Z2 invariant are defined based on the bulk properties of the system, and they are directly linked to the existence of robust edge states through the bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) \\[1]. This correspondence ensures that the topological properties of the bulk are reflected in the presence of protected gapless states at the boundaries, which are immune to certain types of perturbations.\n\nHowever, the extension of topological concepts to non-Hermitian systems introduces a paradigm shift. Unlike Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can exhibit complex eigenvalues and non-unitary dynamics, leading to fundamentally different behaviors. One of the most striking differences is the breakdown of the conventional BBC in non-Hermitian systems, where the relationship between bulk topology and boundary states becomes non-trivial or even absent in certain cases \\[3]. This has necessitated the development of new theoretical frameworks to characterize topological phases in non-Hermitian settings, such as generalized topological invariants that account for the non-Hermitian nature of the Hamiltonian.\n\nThe emergence of non-Hermitian topological phases is closely tied to the presence of exceptional points (EPs), where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, leading to non-trivial topological structures. These EPs can give rise to unique physical phenomena, such as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where bulk states accumulate at the boundaries, drastically altering the transport properties of the system \\[7]. Furthermore, the role of symmetry in non-Hermitian systems is more nuanced. While Hermitian systems rely on symmetries such as time-reversal, particle-hole, and chiral symmetries to define topological classes, non-Hermitian systems often require the introduction of generalized symmetry classes, such as PT symmetry, to stabilize topological phases in the presence of non-real eigenvalues \\[5].\n\nThe papers \\[1], \\[3], and \\[5] collectively highlight the conceptual shift from Hermitian to non-Hermitian topological systems. The first paper provides a comprehensive overview of the historical development and the motivations for studying non-Hermitian topological phenomena, emphasizing the relevance of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in describing open quantum systems and classical wave systems. The second paper addresses the breakdown of the conventional BBC in non-Hermitian systems and explores the emergence of new topological invariants that can characterize such systems. The third paper focuses on PT-symmetric systems, demonstrating that stable topological phases can exist despite the presence of non-real eigenvalues, thus challenging the earlier assumption that non-Hermitian systems are inherently unstable.\n\nThese studies collectively reveal that the theoretical framework for non-Hermitian topological systems is significantly richer and more complex than that of their Hermitian counterparts. The implications for physical realizations are profound, as non-Hermitian effects open up new avenues for engineering topological states with unique properties, such as enhanced robustness against disorder or novel transport behaviors. The experimental realization of these phenomena, as seen in systems like ultracold atoms and electrical circuits, further underscores the potential of non-Hermitian topological systems to revolutionize both fundamental physics and applied technologies.",

These systems challenge the conventional understanding of topological phases and their classification, necessitating the development of new theoretical tools such as generalized Brillouin zones and non-Bloch topological invariants. The role of PT symmetry in stabilizing topological phases and protecting them from the destabilizing effects of non-Hermiticity is a central theme, as discussed in [1,5]. PT symmetry ensures real eigenvalues under certain conditions, thereby enabling the existence of topologically protected states even in the presence of non-Hermitian perturbations. However, when PT symmetry is broken, the system can exhibit exceptional points where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, leading to the breakdown of topological protection and the emergence of complex eigenvalue spectra.\n\nOne of the most significant conceptual advancements in the field is the redefinition of topological invariants in non-Hermitian systems. Traditional invariants such as the Chern number or Zak phase, which rely on the uniform distribution of bulk states, are no longer applicable due to the non-Hermitian skin effect—the localization of bulk eigenstates at system boundaries. This phenomenon, as analyzed in [3], necessitates the use of the non-Bloch winding number as a more accurate topological invariant. The non-Bloch winding number accounts for the modified Brillouin zone structure in non-Hermitian systems and provides a more robust characterization of topological phases. This shift from Bloch-based invariants to non-Bloch invariants represents a fundamental departure from the conventional framework of topological classification.\n\nThe evolution of these theoretical concepts has been driven by both analytical and experimental investigations. Theoretical models such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and topological semimetals have been instrumental in demonstrating the emergence of topological zero modes and the role of non-Bloch invariants in their characterization [3]. Experimental realizations, such as the observation of the non-Hermitian skin effect in ultracold atomic systems, have provided direct evidence for these theoretical predictions and underscored the physical relevance of non-Hermitian topology. Furthermore, studies in photonic systems, as detailed in [7], have demonstrated the practical implications of PT symmetry in maintaining the stability of topological edge states under non-Hermitian perturbations.\n\nDespite these advancements, several challenges remain. The interplay between PT symmetry, non-Hermitian skin effects, and boundary conditions continues to be a subject of intense investigation. Additionally, the generalization of topological invariants to higher dimensions and the development of robust experimental platforms for studying non-Hermitian topological phenomena represent important areas for future research. The conceptual framework of non-Hermitian topology thus stands at the intersection of theoretical innovation and experimental validation, offering new perspectives on the interplay between non-Hermiticity, topology, and quantum transport.",

This symmetry ensures real eigenvalues under specific conditions, thereby protecting topological phases even in non-Hermitian settings [1].\n\nIn the context of topological protection, the paper [5] provides a detailed analysis of how PT symmetry can stabilize non-Hermitian systems. It emphasizes that PT symmetry protects topological phases by maintaining real eigenvalues and preventing the collapse of topological invariants. The study further explores the scenario where PT symmetry is broken, leading to the formation of exceptional points—points where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. These exceptional points significantly alter the topological properties of the system, often resulting in the destabilization of topological phases. The paper also demonstrates that topological phases can exist in both gapped and gapless systems under PT symmetry, broadening the scope of non-Hermitian topological systems.\n\nIn contrast, the paper [7] investigates the role of PT symmetry in photonic systems, specifically in the context of topological mobility edges and transport phenomena. While it shares the general principle that PT symmetry can protect topological phases, the paper focuses on how PT symmetry influences the stability of edge states in photonic quantum walks. The study shows that PT symmetry can stabilize topological edge states even in the presence of non-Hermitian perturbations, such as gain and loss. However, when PT symmetry is broken, the system exhibits a transition from a topologically protected phase to a trivial one, with the emergence of complex eigenvalues and the breakdown of robust edge states. This highlights the critical role of PT symmetry in maintaining the stability of topological phases in photonic systems.\n\nThe conditions under which PT symmetry is broken differ between the two studies. In [5], PT symmetry breaking is associated with the formation of exceptional points, which can lead to a reconfiguration of the system's topological properties. In [7], PT symmetry breaking is linked to the introduction of non-Hermitian terms, such as asymmetric gain and loss, which disrupt the balance required for PT symmetry. These differences reflect the distinct physical systems studied—electronic systems in the former and photonic systems in the latter.\n\nWhile both studies emphasize the importance of PT symmetry in stabilizing topological phases, they differ in their focus and the physical contexts in which PT symmetry is applied. The electronic system study provides a more general theoretical framework for understanding how PT symmetry protects topological phases, while the photonic system study offers a concrete experimental realization, demonstrating the practical implications of PT symmetry in transport and edge state stability. These complementary perspectives underscore the versatility of PT symmetry as a tool for topological protection in non-Hermitian systems.",

This phenomenon, as described in [3], refers to the localization of bulk eigenstates at the system boundaries rather than their uniform distribution throughout the bulk. This deviation from the conventional behavior challenges the standard framework for characterizing topological phases and necessitates a reevaluation of the relationship between bulk properties and boundary states.\n\nThe non-Hermitian skin effect leads to a redefinition of the Brillouin zone and topological invariants. In Hermitian systems, the bulk-boundary correspondence is typically established through the analysis of Bloch states and the associated topological invariants, such as the Chern number or the Zak phase. However, in non-Hermitian systems, the presence of the skin effect causes the bulk states to be exponentially localized at the edges, which invalidates the standard Bloch wavefunction approach. Instead, the non-Bloch winding number has been proposed as a more appropriate topological invariant to characterize the system's phase, as demonstrated in [3]. This shift implies that the phase diagrams of non-Hermitian systems can differ significantly from those of their Hermitian counterparts, as the topological classification is no longer based on the conventional Bloch-Hamiltonian formalism.\n\nThe experimental realization of the non-Hermitian skin effect in ultracold atomic systems, as reported in [2], provides direct evidence of this phenomenon. Using ultracold atoms in a synthetic lattice with engineered non-Hermitian couplings, researchers observed the localization of eigenstates at the boundaries, confirming the theoretical predictions. This experimental work not only validates the existence of the skin effect but also highlights the potential for studying non-Hermitian topology in controllable quantum platforms.\n\nThe implications of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the stability and robustness of edge states are profound. In conventional topological systems, edge states are protected by the bulk topology and are robust against perturbations that do not close the bulk gap. However, in non-Hermitian systems, the localization of bulk states at the boundaries can lead to a breakdown of this protection. The edge states in such systems may exhibit different stability properties, as their robustness is influenced by the interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect and the system's boundary conditions. This raises important questions about the nature of topological protection in non-Hermitian systems and the conditions under which edge states remain stable.\n\nOverall, the non-Hermitian skin effect fundamentally alters the bulk-boundary correspondence, necessitating new theoretical tools and experimental approaches to understand topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems. The redefinition of the Brillouin zone and the use of non-Bloch invariants represent a significant shift in the theoretical framework, while the experimental realization in ultracold atoms underscores the physical relevance of these concepts. These developments open new avenues for exploring the interplay between non-Hermiticity, topology, and boundary physics, with potential applications in quantum simulation, photonics, and condensed matter systems.",

In photonic systems, non-Hermitian effects are often introduced through asymmetric hopping amplitudes or complex potentials, leading to unique transport properties such as mobility edges and pseudo dynamical localization [7]. These effects are observed in synthetic mesh lattices using photonic quantum walks, where the interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology results in distinct dynamical behaviors depending on the nature of the non-Hermitian perturbation. In contrast, ultracold atom systems provide a quantum many-body platform where non-Hermitian effects are realized through gain and loss profiles, leading to the observation of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and topological edge states [2]. The NHSE manifests as the exponential localization of eigenstates at the boundaries, which is robust against certain types of disorder, suggesting that non-Hermitian topology can persist in the presence of perturbations.\n\nElectrical circuits offer a tunable and accessible platform for simulating non-Hermitian topological systems, where resistors are used to introduce gain and loss, effectively mimicking non-Hermitian Hamiltonians [4]. These circuits allow for the observation of topologically protected edge states, which are confirmed through impedance measurements. The high controllability of electrical circuits enables the exploration of non-Hermitian effects under varying conditions, making them a promising tool for experimental validation of theoretical predictions. However, maintaining precise control over gain and loss while minimizing parasitic effects and noise remains a challenge.\n\nThe advantages and limitations of each platform reflect their suitability for different aspects of non-Hermitian topological studies. Photonic systems excel in demonstrating transport phenomena and mobility edges, while ultracold atoms provide insights into the interplay between non-Hermiticity and many-body effects. Electrical circuits, on the other hand, offer a practical and scalable approach for studying topological phase transitions and edge states. Despite these differences, all platforms contribute to a deeper understanding of how non-Hermitian terms in the Hamiltonian influence topological behavior, paving the way for future research into the applications of non-Hermitian topology in quantum information, photonics, and condensed matter physics.",

In particular, the study by [7] demonstrates that the nature of non-Hermiticity—whether arising from hopping asymmetry or complex potentials—plays a critical role in determining the transport properties of the system. The authors observed mobility edges in the complex energy plane, which separate extended and localized states, and linked these features to topological phase transitions. This aligns with theoretical predictions that non-Hermitian systems can exhibit unique topological invariants, such as the non-Bloch Chern number, which differ from their Hermitian counterparts.\n\nIn contrast, the work on ultracold atoms reported in [2] provides a complementary platform for studying non-Hermitian effects in a quantum many-body system. The experiment successfully observed the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where eigenstates are exponentially localized at the boundaries due to the interplay between non-Hermitian terms and system geometry. This phenomenon was shown to be robust against certain types of disorder, suggesting that the NHSE can emerge even in the presence of perturbations. The authors also noted the formation of topological edge states, which are analogous to those seen in Hermitian topological insulators but exhibit distinct characteristics due to the non-Hermitian nature of the Hamiltonian.\n\nBoth studies highlight the importance of asymmetry and complex potentials in shaping the topological response of the system. In photonic systems, the asymmetry in hopping amplitudes was shown to induce a directional transport of wave packets, while in cold atom systems, the combination of gain and loss profiles led to the emergence of non-Hermitian edge states. The role of disorder, however, remains a nuanced aspect. While the photonic experiment suggested that certain forms of disorder could be tolerated without destroying the topological features, the cold atom study emphasized the need for precise control over the non-Hermitian parameters to maintain the integrity of the observed phenomena.\n\nMoreover, the interplay between non-Hermitian terms and system topology leads to a rich variety of behaviors. For instance, in the photonic quantum walk setup, the presence of complex potentials was found to induce mobility edges, which are not typically observed in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the NHSE in cold atom systems manifests as a bulk-boundary correspondence that is fundamentally different from the conventional one. These findings underscore the versatility of photonic and cold atom platforms in probing non-Hermitian topological physics, offering a unique opportunity to explore how non-Hermiticity modifies the traditional understanding of topological phases.\n\nOverall, the experimental results from these studies demonstrate that non-Hermitian terms in the Hamiltonian can lead to a wide range of topological behaviors, from mobility edges to skin effects and edge states. The comparison between photonic and cold atom systems reveals both commonalities and differences in how these phenomena are realized, depending on the specific implementation of non-Hermiticity. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of non-Hermitian topology and provide a foundation for future research into its applications in quantum information, photonics, and condensed matter physics.",

A notable example is the work by [4], which presents a circuit design where resistors are used to introduce gain and loss, effectively simulating non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The circuit is engineered to support topological phases, and by tuning the resistance values, the system can transition between different topological states. This is corroborated by impedance measurements that reveal the presence of topologically protected edge states, confirming the feasibility of such an approach for exploring non-Hermitian topology in a controllable and accessible setting.\n\nIn contrast, theoretical models from [7] provide a broader framework for understanding the mobility and transport properties of edge states in non-Hermitian systems. These models emphasize the role of non-Hermitian effects such as exceptional points and parity-time (PT) symmetry in shaping the behavior of topological states. While the theoretical analysis is abstract and often relies on idealized Hamiltonians, the experimental work in electrical circuits offers a tangible and tunable platform for testing these predictions. The combination of theoretical insights and experimental validation in electrical circuits allows for a more comprehensive understanding of non-Hermitian topological phenomena.\n\nOne of the key advantages of using electrical circuits for simulating non-Hermitian topological systems is the high degree of controllability and flexibility they offer. Unlike quantum or photonic systems, which often require complex and expensive infrastructure, electrical circuits can be readily modified and tested in a laboratory environment. This makes them particularly useful for exploring the interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity under varying conditions. Additionally, the ability to directly measure impedance and other electrical quantities provides a direct link between theoretical predictions and experimental observations.\n\nHowever, maintaining controlled gain and loss in such circuits presents significant challenges. The introduction of resistive elements to simulate gain and loss must be carefully calibrated to avoid unwanted distortions or instabilities in the system. Furthermore, the presence of parasitic elements and noise can complicate the interpretation of experimental results. These challenges highlight the need for advanced circuit design and precise measurement techniques to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of the experiments. Despite these difficulties, the progress made in this area demonstrates the potential of electrical circuits as a versatile tool for studying non-Hermitian topological physics.",

Specifically, the work on entanglement phase transitions in non-Hermitian Kitaev chains [6] demonstrates that the bipartite entanglement entropy (EE) of steady states exhibits distinct scaling behaviors depending on the topological phase of the system. In topologically nontrivial phases, the EE scales logarithmically with system size, whereas in trivial phases, it becomes independent of system size. This difference in scaling behavior serves as a clear signature of topological phase transitions, with the scaling coefficients differing between distinct topological phases. Furthermore, the study identifies two types of transitions: log-law to log-law and log-law to area-law, both of which are associated with changes in the topological nature of the system.\n\nThese findings contrast with the focus of the paper on edge states and topological invariants in non-Hermitian systems [3], which primarily addresses the redefinition of topological invariants and the implications for the bulk-boundary correspondence. While this paper does not explicitly explore entanglement phase transitions, it provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how non-Hermitian terms, such as particle losses, can modify the topological structure of a system. The presence of non-Hermitian perturbations, such as gain and loss, can drive the system through topological phase transitions by altering the effective Hamiltonian and consequently the topological invariants.\n\nThe role of entanglement in characterizing these transitions is particularly important. The logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy in non-Hermitian systems suggests that entanglement can serve as a robust order parameter for detecting topological phase transitions, even in the presence of non-Hermitian effects. This is a critical observation for quantum information processing, where entanglement is a key resource for tasks such as quantum computing and error correction. The ability to detect and manipulate topological phases via entanglement provides a new avenue for designing fault-tolerant quantum systems. However, the study also highlights the challenges posed by non-Hermitian dynamics, which can lead to non-trivial behaviors in entanglement, such as sudden transitions or non-monotonic evolution.\n\nIn summary, while the paper on edge states and topological invariants does not directly address entanglement phase transitions, it provides essential theoretical context for understanding how non-Hermitian terms can influence topological properties. The entanglement phase transition study, on the other hand, offers a concrete framework for characterizing these transitions through quantum correlations. Together, these works underscore the importance of entanglement as a tool for probing and controlling topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems, with profound implications for the development of quantum technologies.",

A central issue identified in multiple works is the difficulty in distinguishing between different forms of non-Hermiticity, such as hopping asymmetry and complex potential, which can lead to ambiguities in interpreting experimental results [4,7]. This challenge is compounded by the limited experimental control over non-Hermitian parameters, making it difficult to validate theoretical predictions in real-world systems.\n\nIn the quantum many-body regime, the observation of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) remains particularly challenging due to the complexity of controlling and measuring quantum states with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The interplay between many-body interactions and the NHSE further complicates the theoretical description of such systems, necessitating the development of new experimental and theoretical tools [2]. Similarly, in the context of entanglement phase transitions in non-Hermitian Kitaev chains, the lack of a unified theoretical framework to describe these phenomena poses a significant obstacle. The difficulty in characterizing entanglement in nonequilibrium steady states and the limited generalizability of observed scaling behaviors to other models highlight the need for more precise experimental control over gain and loss mechanisms [6].\n\nTheoretical challenges are equally significant. The breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems necessitates the development of generalized concepts, such as a modified Brillouin zone, to properly define topological invariants. This is especially critical for understanding the implications of the non-Hermitian skin effect on other topological models and for establishing a robust theoretical foundation for non-Hermitian topology [3]. Additionally, the stability of topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly when PT symmetry is broken, remains an open question. The generalization of topological invariants to non-Hermitian systems is an active area of research, with ongoing efforts to reconcile theoretical predictions with experimental observations [5].\n\nDespite these challenges, several promising directions for future research emerge. One key area is the integration of computational models with experimental data to better understand the interplay between non-Hermitian effects and topological properties. This approach could help bridge the gap between theory and experiment, especially in systems with complex boundary conditions or many-body interactions. Another important direction is the exploration of new physical systems for non-Hermitian topology, including higher-dimensional platforms or systems with more complex gain-loss configurations. Such efforts could lead to the discovery of novel topological phenomena and expand the applicability of non-Hermitian topology in quantum information processing and sensing [1].",

This evolution has led to the discovery of novel topological phases, such as those protected by PT symmetry, and has redefined the concept of topological invariants in the presence of non-Hermitian effects [1,5]. A key breakthrough has been the identification of the non-Hermitian skin effect, where bulk states localize at the boundaries, challenging the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence and necessitating the redefinition of topological invariants within a generalized Brillouin zone [3].\n\nExperimental realizations have further validated these theoretical insights, demonstrating the emergence of topologically distinct mobility edges in quasicrystalline systems through photonic quantum walks, and observing the non-Hermitian skin effect in ultracold atomic gases, which opens new avenues for studying many-body interactions in non-Hermitian systems [2,7]. Additionally, the successful implementation of non-Hermitian topological circuits with gain and loss-induced edge states showcases the potential for actively controllable topological devices, offering a platform for exploring non-Hermitian effects in a more flexible and tunable setting [4].\n\nThe interplay between non-Hermitian effects and topological properties has also been explored in the context of entanglement phase transitions, where the spectral, topological, and entanglement characteristics of non-Hermitian Kitaev chains were analyzed, revealing new methods for dynamically probing topological features in nonequilibrium systems [6]. These findings underscore the richness of non-Hermitian topological systems and their potential to reveal new physical phenomena that are inaccessible in Hermitian settings.\n\nLooking ahead, several promising directions for future research emerge. First, the role of non-Hermitian effects in quantum computing remains an open and exciting area, particularly in the context of topologically protected qubits and error-resilient quantum information processing. Second, the development of new topological materials that exploit non-Hermitian symmetries, such as PT symmetry, could lead to the design of devices with unconventional transport properties, such as unidirectional waveguides or robust photonic circuits. Finally, the exploration of non-Hermitian many-body systems, especially in the context of ultracold atoms and strongly correlated electron systems, could provide deeper insights into the interplay between topology, non-Hermiticity, and quantum coherence. These directions highlight the transformative impact of non-Hermitian topological phenomena and their potential to reshape both fundamental physics and applied technologies.",
