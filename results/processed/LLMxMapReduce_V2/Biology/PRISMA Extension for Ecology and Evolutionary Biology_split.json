While PRISMA has been widely adopted in medical and health sciences, its direct application to ecological and evolutionary research has been limited due to the unique methodological characteristics of these disciplines. Ecological and evolutionary studies often involve non-randomized designs, observational data, complex environmental variables, and heterogeneous data sources, which are not fully captured by the standard PRISMA checklist [1,3]. This has led to calls for a specialized extension, such as PRISMA-EcoEvo, which is tailored to the specific needs of ecological and evolutionary research.\n\nThe development of PRISMA-EcoEvo is driven by the recognition that existing reporting standards often fail to address the complexities of ecological and evolutionary meta-analyses. A meta-evaluation of the quality of reporting and execution in ecological meta-analyses revealed significant variability in the rigor and transparency of published studies, underscoring the necessity for structured reporting frameworks [2]. These studies highlight the limitations of current reporting practices, particularly in the areas of study selection, data extraction, and the handling of non-independence among observations, which are frequently underreported in ecological meta-analyses. The proposed PRISMA-EcoEvo extension aims to bridge this gap by providing a clear, discipline-specific checklist that guides authors through the essential elements of reporting.\n\nDespite the potential of PRISMA-EcoEvo, the implementation of such a framework remains in its early stages. Challenges persist in the consistent application of reporting standards, with many studies failing to provide adequate detail on key methodological aspects such as data collection protocols, statistical methods, and risk-of-bias assessments. These shortcomings not only reduce the reliability of meta-analytic findings but also hinder the reproducibility and comparability of results across studies [1,4]. Moreover, the lack of standardized approaches to handling phylogenetic non-independence and the variability in outcome measures further complicate the synthesis of ecological and evolutionary evidence.\n\nWhile the PRISMATIC project has introduced valuable tools for improving reporting and peer review in health-related systematic reviews, its scope and methodology are not directly applicable to ecological and evolutionary research, which requires a more specialized approach due to the diversity of study designs and data types [5]. The development of a unified and adaptable framework that can accommodate the diversity of ecological study designs remains a critical area for future research. The successful implementation of PRISMA-EcoEvo will depend on widespread adoption, training, and ongoing refinement based on empirical feedback from the research community. By addressing the unique methodological challenges of ecological and evolutionary research, the PRISMA-EcoEvo extension has the potential to significantly enhance the transparency, reproducibility, and credibility of meta-analyses in these fields.",

      "content": "The development of structured reporting guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses has gained increasing attention in ecological and evolutionary biology, driven by the recognition of the field’s unique methodological challenges. While meta-analyses have become a central tool for synthesizing ecological and evolutionary data, their reliability is often compromised by inconsistent and incomplete reporting practices. This issue is particularly acute in ecological research, where studies frequently involve non-randomized designs, complex environmental variables, and heterogeneous data sources, making standard reporting frameworks like PRISMA less applicable without modification [1,3].\n\nSeveral studies have highlighted the variability in the quality of reporting across ecological meta-analyses. For instance, a survey of 102 systematic reviews and meta-analyses published between 2010 and 2019 revealed that reporting quality was below optimal and often underestimated by the research community [4]. This finding underscores the urgent need for standardized reporting guidelines tailored to the specific needs of ecological and evolutionary research. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement, widely used in medical and health sciences, has been adapted for these disciplines through the development of PRISMA-EcoEvo, a specialized extension designed to address the unique complexities of ecological and evolutionary studies [1,3].\n\nIn addition to PRISMA-EcoEvo, initiatives such as the PRISMATIC project have sought to improve the completeness and consistency of reporting in systematic reviews by developing tools to support structured documentation and peer review processes [5]. Although primarily focused on health evidence, the principles underlying the PRISMATIC project—such as the use of checklists, automated validation tools, and improved transparency—offer valuable insights for ecological and evolutionary research. The need for a unified and adaptable framework that can accommodate the diversity of ecological study designs remains a critical area for future development.\n\nOverall, the current body of literature emphasizes the importance of improving reporting standards in ecological and evolutionary meta-analyses to enhance the transparency, reproducibility, and reliability of synthesized findings. While PRISMA-EcoEvo represents a significant step forward, ongoing efforts are required to refine and implement these guidelines across the broader research community. The integration of domain-specific extensions, combined with the adoption of innovative reporting tools, will be essential in ensuring that ecological and evolutionary meta-analyses meet the highest standards of scientific rigor.",

A meta-evaluation of the quality of reporting and execution in ecological meta-analyses revealed significant variability in the rigor and transparency of published studies, underscoring the necessity for structured reporting frameworks such as the PRISMA extension [2]. This study, along with others, points to the limitations of existing reporting standards in adequately capturing the complexity of ecological and evolutionary research, which often involves heterogeneous data sources, diverse methodologies, and non-standardized outcome measures.\n\nThe development of the PRISMA-EcoEvo extension was proposed as a targeted solution to these challenges. Several papers stress that the lack of discipline-specific reporting guidelines hampers the ability to assess the quality and reliability of meta-analyses in ecology and evolutionary biology [1,3]. These studies argue that a tailored extension of PRISMA is essential to address the unique methodological and conceptual features of ecological and evolutionary research, such as the inclusion of observational studies, the use of phylogenetic data, and the integration of multiple ecological scales.\n\nOne of the key findings from the analysis of these papers is the persistent gap between perceived and actual reporting quality. While many researchers recognize the importance of transparency and reproducibility, the implementation of standardized reporting practices remains inconsistent. This discrepancy is particularly evident in the handling of study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessments, which are critical components of systematic reviews and meta-analyses [4]. The proposed PRISMA-EcoEvo extension aims to bridge this gap by providing a clear, discipline-specific checklist that guides authors through the essential elements of reporting.\n\nIn contrast, the Prismatic Project, while addressing similar issues in healthcare systematic reviews, does not directly engage with the specific challenges faced in ecological and evolutionary biology. The project focuses on harmonizing PRISMA extensions across health-related fields and introduces digital tools to improve reporting and peer review. However, its scope and methodology are not directly applicable to the ecological and evolutionary context, where the diversity of study designs and data types necessitates a more specialized approach [5].\n\nOverall, the synthesis of these findings indicates a strong consensus among researchers on the need for a PRISMA extension tailored to ecological and evolutionary biology. The proposed PRISMA-EcoEvo framework represents a critical step toward enhancing the transparency, reproducibility, and credibility of meta-analyses in these fields.

Initially developed to enhance transparency and reproducibility in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, PRISMA has been widely adopted in various fields, including ecology and evolutionary biology. However, the unique methodological characteristics of ecological and evolutionary research—such as the prevalence of observational data, long-term monitoring, and phylogenetic relationships—pose challenges that are not fully addressed by the standard PRISMA checklist [1,3].\n\nThis has led to a growing recognition of the need for a specialized extension, such as PRISMA-EcoEvo, which is tailored to the distinct features of ecological and evolutionary studies. The development of this extension is driven by the limitations identified in existing reporting practices, particularly in the areas of study selection, data extraction, and handling of non-independence among observations, which are frequently underreported in ecological meta-analyses [2].

By addressing the heterogeneity of study designs—ranging from observational studies to manipulative experiments and comparative analyses—it aims to align reporting standards more closely with the epistemological foundations of these disciplines [1,3]. This reorientation is essential for reducing bias, enhancing replicability, and facilitating more robust synthesis of ecological and evolutionary evidence.\n\nDespite its promising potential, the implementation of PRISMA-EcoEvo is still in its early stages, and further research is needed to evaluate its effectiveness and identify areas for refinement. Future work should focus on addressing the methodological constraints of current ecological meta-analyses, such as the lack of standardized approaches to handling phylogenetic non-independence and the variability in outcome measures. Additionally, the integration of emerging technologies and data-sharing practices may provide new opportunities to enhance the applicability and impact of PRISMA-EcoEvo in the broader ecological and evolutionary research community.",

Originally designed for medical systematic reviews and meta-analyses, PRISMA has been widely adopted across various scientific disciplines due to its structured approach to enhancing transparency and reproducibility. However, the application of the standard PRISMA checklist in ecological and evolutionary studies has been limited, as these fields often involve complex data structures, such as observational data, long-term ecological monitoring, and phylogenetic relationships, which are not adequately captured by the original framework [1,3].\n\nA meta-evaluation of the quality of reporting and execution in ecological meta-analyses highlights the need for a specialized extension, such as the PRISMA EcoEvo checklist proposed by O’Dea et al. This checklist is specifically tailored to address the distinct characteristics of ecological and evolutionary studies, including the variability in data sources, study designs, and outcome measures. By providing a structured set of reporting items, PRISMA-EcoEvo aims to improve the clarity, completeness, and replicability of meta-analyses in these fields [1,2].\n\nComparative analyses of existing PRISMA adaptations reveal that while the original checklist has been successfully adapted for other domains, its direct application to ecological and evolutionary research often fails to account for the nuances of these disciplines. For instance, ecological studies frequently rely on observational data rather than controlled experiments, and evolutionary analyses often incorporate phylogenetic information that is not typically considered in medical meta-analyses. These differences necessitate a more flexible and context-specific reporting framework, which PRISMA-EcoEvo seeks to provide.\n\nThe adoption of PRISMA-EcoEvo is not merely a matter of procedural improvement but also a step toward enhancing the credibility and impact of ecological and evolutionary research. By ensuring that studies are reported in a consistent and transparent manner, this extension facilitates better comparison across studies, supports more robust meta-analytical inferences, and promotes methodological rigor in the field. While the implementation of PRISMA-EcoEvo is still in its early stages, its potential to transform the standards of reporting in ecological and evolutionary meta-analyses is widely recognized [2,3].",

While the original PRISMA guidelines were developed for medical research, their adaptation to other disciplines has demonstrated the framework's flexibility. However, ecological and evolutionary studies present unique methodological and conceptual challenges that are not fully addressed by the standard PRISMA checklist [1,3]. These studies often involve non-randomized designs, complex data structures, and a wide range of ecological and evolutionary phenomena, which necessitate a more specialized reporting framework.\n\nSeveral studies emphasize that the lack of standardized reporting in ecological meta-analyses has led to significant gaps in transparency and reproducibility. For instance, the failure to adequately describe methods of study selection, data extraction, and the handling of non-independence among observations is a recurring issue [2]. This deficiency not only hinders the comparability of findings across studies but also introduces potential biases in meta-analytic results. The PRISMA-EcoEvo extension is proposed as a solution to these challenges, aiming to enhance the clarity and completeness of reporting in ecological and evolutionary systematic reviews.\n\nThe necessity for a PRISMA extension in these fields is further reinforced by the recognition that ecological and evolutionary research often involves heterogeneous study designs, including observational studies, manipulative experiments, and comparative analyses. These designs differ fundamentally from the randomized controlled trials that dominate medical research, and as such, the reporting needs of ecological and evolutionary studies are not adequately captured by the original PRISMA guidelines [1,3]. The development of PRISMA-EcoEvo represents a significant step toward addressing these limitations and improving the rigor of systematic reviews in these domains.\n\nMoreover, the evolution of PRISMA from a medical tool to a broader methodological framework illustrates its adaptability, yet the specific demands of ecological and evolutionary research have not been fully met by existing adaptations. This gap has led to calls for a more nuanced and context-specific approach to reporting, one that acknowledges the complexity and diversity of ecological and evolutionary methodologies [3]. The PRISMA-EcoEvo extension is thus not merely an incremental update but a necessary reorientation of reporting standards to better align with the epistemological and methodological foundations of these fields.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of PRISMA-EcoEvo reflects a growing consensus among researchers that structured reporting is essential for improving the quality and reliability of systematic reviews in ecology and evolutionary biology. By addressing the unique methodological challenges of these disciplines, the extension aims to enhance transparency, reduce bias, and facilitate more robust synthesis of ecological and evolutionary evidence.",

A primary issue is the heterogeneity of study designs, which complicates the integration of findings across diverse ecological and evolutionary contexts [3]. This variability is compounded by the absence of standardized data collection protocols, leading to inconsistencies in how data are gathered and reported. Such inconsistencies diminish the robustness of meta-analytic results and hinder the ability of subsequent researchers to replicate or build upon prior work [1,4].\n\nAnother significant challenge lies in the inconsistency of primary study selection criteria. Many meta-analyses employ varying inclusion and exclusion standards, which can introduce bias and reduce the generalizability of their findings [1,4]. This lack of uniformity is further exacerbated by inadequate statistical reporting, where essential details such as effect sizes, confidence intervals, and statistical tests are often omitted or poorly described. This omission limits the utility of meta-analytic results for future research and undermines the scientific rigor of the field [2].\n\nTransparency in reporting procedures remains a critical concern, as many meta-analyses fail to provide clear descriptions of data extraction processes, risk-of-bias assessments, and methods for addressing non-independence, such as phylogenetic or temporal dependencies. This is particularly problematic in ecological and evolutionary research, where such factors can significantly influence the interpretation of effect sizes. For example, a meta-evaluation found that few studies accounted for phylogenetic non-independence, leading to potential overestimation of effect sizes and misleading inferences [2].\n\nAdditionally, the use of inappropriate statistical methods is a recurring issue. Some studies employ methods that do not account for the hierarchical or clustered nature of ecological data, resulting in inflated Type I error rates and unreliable inferences. The lack of clear guidance on best practices for statistical modeling in this domain further contributes to methodological variability [4].\n\nThese challenges collectively highlight the urgent need for a structured and standardized reporting framework, such as the PRISMA extension for ecology and evolutionary biology, to enhance the quality, transparency, and reproducibility of meta-analyses in this field. While current reporting standards are insufficient, there is growing recognition of the importance of structured reporting, and a potential for increased adoption of such guidelines if they are developed with the specific needs of the field in mind [1,3].",

A critical issue identified across multiple studies is the lack of adherence to established reporting standards, which undermines the reliability and transparency of meta-analytic work in this field [3]. For instance, a survey of 208 researchers and an evaluation of 102 meta-analyses demonstrated that the quality of reporting was generally poor and often fell below perceived standards [1]. This suggests a systemic gap in the application of structured reporting frameworks, which is further supported by the observation that only a small percentage of studies referenced existing guidelines such as PRISMA [4].\n\nDespite these shortcomings, the findings also highlight a potential for improvement. Researchers expressed interest in using reporting guidelines to enhance the quality of their work, indicating a willingness to adopt more rigorous standards if they are accessible and tailored to the specific needs of ecological and evolutionary research [1]. This aligns with the broader argument that the development of a PRISMA extension specifically for ecology and evolutionary biology could address these reporting gaps and improve the overall quality of meta-analyses in the field [3].\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while reporting quality is a critical factor, it does not necessarily correlate with the quality of execution. A meta-evaluation of ecological meta-analyses revealed that poor reporting practices significantly impede the ability of readers to assess the reliability of findings, but the execution of the analyses—such as the selection of studies, statistical methods, and handling of heterogeneity—remains an equally pressing concern [2]. This distinction underscores the need for a comprehensive approach that not only improves reporting but also enhances the methodological rigor of meta-analyses in ecological and evolutionary research.\n\nIn summary, the existing literature points to a clear need for a PRISMA extension tailored to the unique characteristics of ecological and evolutionary meta-analyses.

The primary objective of these items is to enhance the transparency, reproducibility, and methodological rigor of research reporting, ensuring that all critical aspects of the review process—such as search strategies, inclusion criteria, data extraction, and statistical methods—are explicitly documented [1,3].\n\nA key focus of the PRISMA-EcoEvo extension is the need for structured reporting of study selection and data extraction processes. This is particularly important in ecological and evolutionary research, where the complexity of study designs and the variability of data sources can lead to inconsistencies in reporting. For instance, the extension emphasizes the importance of addressing non-independence in effect sizes, a common challenge in ecological meta-analyses, where multiple effect sizes may be derived from the same study or population [2]. This issue can significantly affect the validity of statistical inferences, making the inclusion of specific reporting items crucial for methodological clarity.\n\nMoreover, the PRISMA-EcoEvo checklist includes items related to study design, data collection, and statistical methods that are particularly relevant to ecological and evolutionary research. These items aim to improve the clarity and completeness of reporting by guiding authors, reviewers, and editors on the essential information that should be included in their reports. For example, the checklist encourages the explicit description of search strategies, including the databases used, search terms, and date ranges, which enhances the reproducibility of the review process [1].\n\nWhile the PRISMA-EcoEvo extension provides a comprehensive framework for improving reporting standards, it is also important to recognize the limitations and challenges associated with its implementation. The extension is designed to address the unique methodological complexities of ecological and evolutionary studies, such as the presence of nested or hierarchical data structures, which require specialized statistical approaches. However, the successful application of the checklist depends on the awareness and adherence of researchers to these guidelines, as well as the availability of training and support for their implementation [3].\n\nIn summary, the PRISMA-EcoEvo extension represents a critical step toward improving the quality and transparency of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in ecology and evolutionary biology.

Across multiple studies, it has been consistently observed that ecological meta-analyses frequently omit critical details regarding search strategies, inclusion criteria, statistical methods, and data handling procedures, particularly in relation to the treatment of non-independence and the exploration of moderator variables [1,2]. These deficiencies not only complicate the replication of studies but also limit the capacity for meaningful comparison and synthesis across research efforts.\n\nThe lack of adherence to established reporting guidelines, such as PRISMA, further exacerbates these issues, as only a small proportion of ecological meta-analyses reference or follow such frameworks, indicating a general lack of awareness or enforcement of standardized reporting practices [1,2]. This gap in methodological rigor highlights the urgent need for a PRISMA extension specifically tailored to ecological and evolutionary research, such as PRISMA-EcoEvo, which aims to address the unique challenges of this field by promoting a more structured and transparent approach to reporting.\n\nDespite the proposed benefits of such guidelines, their adoption remains limited, and the literature suggests that the successful implementation of PRISMA-EcoEvo requires sustained efforts to increase researcher awareness, provide training in systematic review methodologies, and foster a culture of transparency and rigor in ecological research [1,3].

A comprehensive analysis of 102 ecological meta-analyses published between 2010 and 2019 demonstrates that reporting quality is generally poor, with many studies failing to provide sufficient detail on their methods, data sources, and statistical approaches [1,4]. This lack of transparency hampers the reproducibility and validity of findings, as critical information such as sampling procedures, inclusion criteria, and data extraction methods is often omitted.\n\nFurther investigation into the reporting practices of ecological meta-analyses reveals that while some studies attempt to follow established guidelines, such as PRISMA, the adherence is minimal. Only a small percentage of the reviewed papers reference these guidelines, indicating a general lack of awareness or enforcement of standardized reporting frameworks [1,4].

This issue is exacerbated by the lack of adherence to established reporting guidelines, as noted in several papers, which report that the majority of studies do not follow any structured framework for reporting their findings [1,2].\n\nThe root causes of this reporting deficit are multifaceted. Some studies suggest that the lack of awareness of reporting guidelines, such as PRISMA-EcoEvo, contributes significantly to the problem [1,3].

These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions, including educational initiatives and the promotion of structured reporting frameworks.\n\nThe adoption of the PRISMA extension for ecology and evolutionary biology (PRISMA-EcoEvo) has been proposed as a potential solution to these challenges. According to the evaluations, the implementation of PRISMA-EcoEvo could significantly enhance the quality of reporting by providing a standardized framework for describing study designs, methodologies, and results [2,3]. This structured approach not only improves transparency but also facilitates the comparison and synthesis of findings across studies, which is essential for advancing the field of ecological and evolutionary research.\n\nDespite the clear benefits of PRISMA-EcoEvo, the evidence suggests that its uptake remains limited.

A recurring issue is the lack of detailed search strategies, which hampers the transparency and reproducibility of the literature search process [1,2]. This deficiency is compounded by incomplete descriptions of inclusion criteria, which limits the ability to assess the scope and representativeness of the included studies [1,2].\n\nAnother common shortcoming is the insufficient reporting of statistical methods. Several papers highlight that many meta-analyses fail to provide adequate justification for the choice of statistical models, which can lead to biased or unreliable conclusions [1,2]. This issue is further exacerbated by the absence of information on the handling of non-independence, such as multiple effect sizes from the same study or spatially correlated data, which can distort the results and reduce the validity of the meta-analysis [2].\n\nIn addition to methodological reporting gaps, the lack of detailed descriptions of study populations and data collection methods is a significant concern. This omission makes it difficult to evaluate the generalizability of findings and the robustness of the data underpinning the meta-analysis [3]. Furthermore, many studies fail to provide sufficient geographic or environmental context, which is critical for interpreting the ecological relevance of the results [3].\n\nThe absence of clear study selection criteria and incomplete data extraction procedures also contribute to the challenges in assessing the reliability of meta-analytic findings [4]. These deficiencies not only affect the reproducibility of the research but also limit the capacity for meaningful comparisons across studies. Moreover, the limited exploration of temporal trends and multifactorial analyses of moderators suggests a gap in the depth of ecological and evolutionary insights derived from meta-analyses [2].\n\nCollectively, these findings underscore the need for standardized reporting guidelines, such as the PRISMA extension for ecology and evolutionary biology, to enhance transparency, improve the quality of meta-analytic research, and ensure that findings are both reliable and interpretable within the broader ecological and evolutionary context.",

These issues, as highlighted in multiple studies, include the failure to report study limitations, a lack of transparency in data handling, and insufficient detail regarding methodological steps, particularly in the context of statistical modeling and the treatment of non-independence ([1,2]). Such shortcomings are not unique to ecological research but are exacerbated by the inherent complexity of ecological data and the diversity of methodologies employed across studies ([1]).\n\nThe introduction of the PRISMA extension for ecology and evolutionary biology (PRISMA-EcoEvo) is presented as a targeted solution to these challenges. This framework aims to standardize reporting practices, thereby enhancing the transparency and rigor of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the field ([1,3]). By providing a structured checklist of reporting items, PRISMA-EcoEvo seeks to address the recurring issues identified in the literature, such as the omission of critical methodological details and the underreporting of study limitations ([1]).\n\nMoreover, the analysis suggests that these reporting deficiencies point to a broader need for more rigorous training in systematic review methodologies and a stronger emphasis on transparency throughout the research process ([1]). While the PRISMA-EcoEvo extension represents a significant step toward improving reporting standards, its effectiveness will depend on the willingness of researchers to adopt and adhere to its guidelines.

Multiple studies have consistently highlighted that inadequate reporting practices—such as the omission of key methodological details, lack of transparency in study selection, and unclear data extraction procedures—compromise the validity of meta-analytic findings and hinder their replication and application [1,2]. These deficiencies not only reduce the credibility of ecological inferences but also limit the capacity of future researchers to build upon existing work, thereby impeding scientific progress.\n\nOne of the most significant consequences of poor reporting is the difficulty in interpreting and validating results. Without clear and standardized reporting, it becomes challenging to assess the robustness of ecological conclusions, particularly in complex systems where methodological transparency is essential for accurate interpretation [2,3]. This issue is particularly acute in ecological and evolutionary biology, where the interplay of multiple variables and the heterogeneity of data sources necessitate rigorous methodological clarity.\n\nMoreover, poor reporting practices hinder the identification of broader ecological trends and patterns, which are crucial for understanding ecosystem dynamics and informing conservation and management strategies. The absence of standardized reporting leads to fragmented data synthesis, increasing the risk of bias and inconsistency in the interpretation of ecological data [3]. As a result, the ability of ecological research to contribute meaningfully to real-world decision-making is significantly constrained.\n\nTo address these challenges, the development and adoption of structured reporting guidelines, such as the PRISMA extension for ecology and evolutionary biology (PRISMA-EcoEvo), have been proposed as a critical step toward improving transparency and methodological rigor in ecological meta-analyses [1].

These findings indicate that while the PRISMA-EcoEvo checklist provides a valuable framework, its impact is constrained by the lack of institutional support and researcher awareness.\n\nMoreover, the necessity of integrating PRISMA-EcoEvo into the peer review process is emphasized in multiple studies. One paper argues that the extension must be more deeply embedded in the review and publication workflow to ensure that it is consistently applied and enforced [4]. This reflects a broader trend in the field, where the gap between methodological recommendations and practical implementation remains a critical issue. The lack of standardization in reporting practices not only undermines the reproducibility of individual studies but also hampers the cumulative progress of ecological and evolutionary research.\n\nIn summary, the PRISMA-EcoEvo extension represents a significant step toward improving the transparency and reproducibility of ecological and evolutionary research. However, its full potential can only be realized through broader adoption, institutional support, and integration into the peer review process. The current literature suggests that while the extension provides a necessary framework, its effectiveness is contingent upon sustained efforts to promote its use among researchers and journals.",

However, despite its potential, several limitations and challenges have been identified that hinder its effectiveness, adoption, and long-term impact. These limitations are primarily centered on methodological gaps, implementation barriers, and the need for ongoing refinement to better align with the unique characteristics of ecological and evolutionary research.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges is the lack of comprehensive guidance on handling non-independence in ecological data, which is a common issue due to the nested or hierarchical nature of ecological datasets. This gap in the PRISMA-EcoEvo checklist may lead to methodological inconsistencies and underreporting of critical details, thereby affecting the reliability and reproducibility of meta-analytic findings [2]. Additionally, the checklist lacks detailed instructions for integrating large-scale, heterogeneous ecological datasets and reporting complex evolutionary models, which are essential for addressing the methodological diversity of the field [1,3].\n\nAnother critical limitation is the absence of standardized metrics for evaluating the quality of ecological meta-analyses. Without such metrics, it becomes difficult to assess the reliability and reproducibility of findings across studies, thereby undermining the transparency and robustness of the meta-analytic process [2,3]. This issue is further compounded by the lack of clear guidance on how to address non-independence in ecological data, a common challenge in studies involving spatial or temporal autocorrelation.\n\nThe implementation and adoption of PRISMA-EcoEvo also face significant barriers. Many researchers are unfamiliar with structured reporting frameworks, often due to a lack of awareness about the benefits of standardized reporting and a reluctance to deviate from traditional practices [1,2]. This resistance is exacerbated by the limited availability of training and support, which prevents researchers from effectively applying the guidelines, resulting in inconsistent or incomplete reporting [3]. Furthermore, institutional backing is lacking, with many research institutions not prioritizing or incentivizing compliance with PRISMA-EcoEvo, which limits its uptake [1].\n\nTo address these challenges, the literature emphasizes the importance of increasing awareness through targeted training and outreach initiatives, as well as the need for journals and funding bodies to play an active role in promoting the checklist by incorporating it into peer review processes and publication requirements [1,3]. The development of training resources and the establishment of supportive academic networks are also seen as essential to ensuring the effective and sustainable implementation of PRISMA-EcoEvo [3].\n\nIn summary, while PRISMA-EcoEvo represents a valuable advancement, its long-term success depends on addressing these limitations through ongoing refinement, validation, and broader implementation strategies. Future research should focus on enhancing the specificity and comprehensiveness of the checklist, developing standardized evaluation metrics, and fostering a culture of methodological transparency and training within the ecological and evolutionary research community.",

However, several limitations and challenges have been identified across multiple studies, indicating that the extension is still in its early stages of development and implementation [1,2,3].\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the lack of comprehensive guidance on handling non-independence in ecological data, which is a common issue in meta-analyses due to the nested or hierarchical nature of ecological datasets [2]. This gap in the PRISMA-EcoEvo checklist may lead to methodological inconsistencies and underreporting of critical methodological details, thereby affecting the reliability and reproducibility of meta-analytic findings.\n\nAdditionally, the extension faces challenges in terms of validation and standardization. While the checklist provides a structured framework for reporting, its effectiveness has not been fully evaluated across a wide range of ecological and evolutionary studies. This lack of empirical validation raises questions about its generalizability and utility in different research contexts [1,3].\n\nAnother critical issue is the variability in the implementation of the PRISMA-EcoEvo checklist. Researchers may interpret and apply the guidelines differently, leading to inconsistencies in the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This variability underscores the need for more standardized training and guidance to ensure that the checklist is used consistently and effectively [1,4].\n\nFurthermore, the limited adoption of the PRISMA-EcoEvo extension by the research community suggests that there is a need for greater awareness and integration into existing research practices. While the checklist is a valuable starting point, its impact will depend on how widely it is adopted and how effectively it is implemented in practice [1,3].\n\nIn summary, while the PRISMA-EcoEvo extension represents an important advancement in the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in ecology and evolutionary biology, it is still in the early stages of development.

These gaps are primarily related to the specificity, applicability, and comprehensiveness of the extension, particularly in addressing the unique methodological challenges inherent to ecological and evolutionary research [1,3,4].\n\nOne of the most frequently cited limitations is the lack of detailed guidance on specific reporting items. This deficiency is particularly problematic given the complexity of ecological and evolutionary studies, which often involve multifactorial designs, phylogenetic dependencies, and non-independence of data points. For instance, the paper by [2] emphasizes the need for more explicit instructions on handling methodological issues such as phylogenetic non-independence and the integration of multifactorial models. Without such guidance, researchers may struggle to apply the checklist consistently or appropriately in their work.\n\nMoreover, the current version of PRISMA-EcoEvo is seen as insufficient in covering the full range of ecological and evolutionary research. Several studies highlight the necessity of incorporating additional reporting items that reflect the diversity of research designs and objectives within the field. This call for expansion is not merely theoretical; it is grounded in practical challenges faced by researchers who find the existing checklist too generic to capture the nuances of their studies. The need for a more tailored approach is underscored by the recognition that ecological and evolutionary research often involves unique data structures, sampling strategies, and analytical techniques that are not fully addressed by the standard PRISMA framework.\n\nAnother recurring theme in the literature is the importance of user feedback in shaping the future development of PRISMA-EcoEvo. The papers consistently argue that the checklist should be refined through iterative processes that incorporate input from researchers across different subfields of ecology and evolutionary biology. This participatory approach would not only enhance the relevance and usability of the checklist but also increase its adoption rate among the scientific community. The call for greater efforts to promote the checklist's use is particularly significant, as the effectiveness of any reporting guideline is contingent upon its widespread implementation.\n\nIn summary, the current state of PRISMA-EcoEvo reveals a clear need for ongoing refinement, with a focus on improving specificity, expanding the scope of reporting items, and integrating user feedback. These improvements are essential to ensure that the checklist remains a valuable tool for enhancing the transparency and reproducibility of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in ecology and evolutionary biology.",
