However, the field faces significant challenges, particularly in the accuracy, scalability, and interpretability of lineage reconstruction methods. A recurring theme across multiple studies is the limitations of traditional lineage tracing techniques, which often lack the resolution and quantitative rigor required to capture complex cellular dynamics ([2,3]). These limitations have driven the development of computational tools such as ECLAIR, which aim to quantify uncertainty in lineage inference, thereby improving the reliability of reconstructed cell trajectories ([2]).\n\nThe foundational role of computational strategies in lineage reconstruction has been emphasized in several works, which highlight the need for intuitive, generalizable workflows that can be applied across diverse biological systems ([4]). While these tools offer powerful capabilities, they remain in an early stage of development and require rigorous validation of their underlying assumptions. For instance, the paper on single-cell computational strategies underscores the importance of critically evaluating the limitations of trajectory inference algorithms, as their outputs can be highly sensitive to data preprocessing and modeling choices.\n\nIn the context of hematopoiesis, single-cell lineage tracing (SCLT) has demonstrated significant potential in elucidating the behavior of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their contributions to blood disorders, cancer, and aging ([5]). Techniques such as CRISPR-based barcoding and base editing have enabled high-resolution tracking of cell fate decisions, offering a more precise and scalable alternative to conventional methods. However, the applicability of these techniques in non-hematological systems remains underexplored, suggesting a potential gap in the current literature.\n\nDespite the growing interest in integrating lineage tracing with single-cell omics, the broader implications of such approaches for fields like cancer biology and regenerative medicine are still being delineated.

The development of more robust, scalable, and interpretable lineage reconstruction methods, coupled with the integration of multi-omics data, will be critical for advancing our understanding of complex biological systems. Future research should focus on addressing the methodological limitations identified in the literature, as well as expanding the applicability of lineage tracing techniques to a broader range of biological contexts.",

This methodological foundation is built on the synergy between experimental techniques for lineage tracking and high-resolution omics data, particularly single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). CRISPR-based lineage tracing, which employs genetic barcodes introduced via CRISPR-Cas9 or base editors, has emerged as a powerful tool for reconstructing lineage trees and identifying key regulatory events during development and disease progression [1,5]. These barcodes allow for the tracking of clonal relationships and the inference of lineage trajectories, complementing the high-resolution gene expression profiles obtained through scRNA-seq [3].\n\nThe computational analysis of lineage-tracing and single-cell omics data is equally critical, with tools like ECLAIR providing statistically rigorous frameworks for lineage inference by quantifying the uncertainty of lineage branchings [2]. Pseudotemporal ordering algorithms further enhance the interpretation of developmental processes by reconstructing the sequence of cellular transitions, although they rely on assumptions such as the continuity of cell states, which may limit their accuracy in complex systems [4]. The integration of lineage data with pseudotemporal ordering requires careful validation and cross-verification with experimental data to ensure the reliability of inferred developmental paths.\n\nBeyond scRNA-seq, the combination of multiple omics modalities—such as single-cell ATAC-seq and single-cell proteomics—has expanded the scope of lineage tracing, offering a more comprehensive view of lineage progression by incorporating epigenetic and protein-level information alongside transcriptional data [1]. However, the high dimensionality and noise inherent in single-cell datasets pose significant challenges for accurate lineage reconstruction, necessitating the development of robust computational frameworks that can effectively process and interpret such complex data [2,5].\n\nDespite the methodological advancements, several challenges remain. The technical limitations of CRISPR-based lineage tracing, such as off-target effects and barcode saturation, are not sufficiently addressed in the literature, highlighting the need for more rigorous benchmarking and theoretical validation of lineage inference algorithms [1,5]. Additionally, the integration of multi-omics data into lineage tracing pipelines is underexplored, restricting the depth of biological insights that can be obtained [5]. Future research should prioritize the development of standardized protocols for barcode design, error correction, and long-term tracking, as well as systematic comparisons with existing lineage tracing modalities to establish best practices for the field.",

This approach combines experimental techniques for tracking cell lineage with high-resolution omics data to reconstruct developmental trajectories and identify key regulatory events. A central theme across multiple studies is the use of CRISPR-based lineage tracing, which employs genetic barcodes to label and track individual cells over time . These barcodes, often introduced via CRISPR-Cas9 or base editors, allow for the reconstruction of lineage trees by capturing mutations that accumulate during cell divisions. This method has been particularly useful in studying stem cell dynamics and fate decisions in complex tissues .\n\nIn parallel, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled the identification of cellular states and rare intermediates, providing a complementary layer of information to lineage tracing. By integrating lineage data with scRNA-seq, researchers can infer lineage trajectories and detect branch points where cell fate decisions occur . This integration is critical for understanding how cellular heterogeneity arises during development or disease progression. For instance, lineage tracing can reveal the progeny of a particular cell, while scRNA-seq can characterize the gene expression profiles of those progeny, enabling a more complete picture of cellular differentiation.\n\nComputational methods play a crucial role in the analysis of lineage-tracing and single-cell omics data. One such method is ECLAIR, which uses an ensemble approach to infer lineage relationships from single-cell gene expression data. ECLAIR not only reconstructs lineage trees but also quantifies the uncertainty of lineage branchings, offering a statistically rigorous framework for interpreting lineage data . This is particularly important given the inherent noise and complexity of single-cell data, which can lead to ambiguous or conflicting lineage inferences.\n\nAnother key computational challenge is the pseudotemporal ordering of cell states, which aims to reconstruct the sequence of cellular transitions during development or disease. Pseudotemporal ordering algorithms, such as those reviewed in , are essential for modeling developmental processes and identifying key regulatory nodes. However, these algorithms rely on certain assumptions, such as the continuity of cell states and the absence of branching, which can limit their accuracy in complex systems. Therefore, the integration of lineage tracing with pseudotemporal ordering requires careful validation and cross-verification with experimental data.\n\nBeyond scRNA-seq, the integration of multiple omics modalities has further expanded the scope of lineage tracing. The review in  highlights the importance of combining genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and other omics data to gain a more comprehensive understanding of cellular diversity. This multi-omics approach not only enhances the resolution of lineage reconstruction but also aids in the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic targets, particularly in the context of tumor heterogeneity.\n\nOverall, the combination of lineage tracing and single-cell omics represents a transformative approach in modern biology. It enables researchers to trace the developmental history of individual cells while simultaneously characterizing their molecular states. This synergy has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of stem cell biology, cancer progression, and tissue regeneration.

Several studies highlight the critical role of computational methods in lineage inference, with ECLAIR being noted as a novel statistical framework that advances the field, although it lacks a comprehensive comparison with existing methods and a detailed theoretical foundation [2]. This gap underscores the need for more rigorous benchmarking and theoretical validation of lineage inference algorithms.\n\nPseudotemporal ordering algorithms, while effective, are contingent upon the quality of input data and the assumptions embedded in their design. A critical evaluation of these tools is essential to ensure their reliability and generalizability across diverse biological systems [4]. This aligns with the broader call for methodological transparency and robustness in lineage trajectory inference.\n\nA key theme across multiple studies is the necessity of integrating both single-cell resolution and lineage information to accurately map developmental processes. The incorporation of time-stamping into lineage trajectory inference tools is particularly emphasized, as it allows for the differentiation of early and late cell states, thereby enhancing the accuracy of developmental maps [3]. This suggests that temporal resolution is a crucial factor in improving the fidelity of lineage reconstruction.\n\nDespite the methodological advancements, several papers point to limitations in the current literature. For instance, while the integration of experimental and computational approaches is recognized as vital for robust lineage mapping, the comparative strengths and weaknesses of different lineage tracing methods remain underexplored [1]. This lack of critical evaluation hinders the broader applicability of these methods.\n\nIn the context of hematological research, the transition from traditional lineage tracing techniques to modern single-cell methods has been marked by the adoption of CRISPR-based barcoding, which enhances resolution and accuracy. However, the technical limitations of these methods, such as off-target effects and barcode saturation, are not sufficiently addressed in the literature [5]. These limitations suggest that while CRISPR-based approaches are promising, they require further refinement and validation.\n\nFinally, the methodological foundations of multi-omics integration, including data harmonization and model interpretability, are well discussed in some studies, yet the specific application of CRISPR-based lineage tracing and single-cell omics techniques remains underrepresented [6]. This indicates a potential gap in the literature, where the intersection of multi-omics and lineage tracing is not fully realized.\n\nTaken together, these findings highlight both the progress and the challenges in the field of lineage tracing combined with single-cell omics. While novel methods and integrative approaches are advancing our understanding of cellular dynamics, there remains a need for more comprehensive comparisons, theoretical grounding, and critical evaluation of existing techniques to ensure their reliability and broad applicability.",

The integration of these barcodes with scRNA-seq provides a unique opportunity to correlate lineage information with gene expression profiles, thereby enhancing the understanding of cellular differentiation and fate decisions.\n\nRecent advancements have further refined CRISPR-based lineage tracing through the application of base editors, which allow for more precise and stable lineage labeling without inducing double-strand breaks, thus reducing off-target effects and improving genomic stability [5]. This innovation has broadened the applicability of CRISPR-based lineage tracing, particularly in sensitive cell types such as hematopoietic stem cells, where genomic integrity is paramount.\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain in the interpretation of lineage data, particularly with regard to the stochasticity of barcode mutations and the resolution limits of scRNA-seq in capturing fine-grained lineage relationships.

Among the various lineage tracing methodologies, CRISPR-based lineage tracing has garnered significant attention due to its scalability and high resolution, as noted in several studies [1]. This technique leverages CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce unique genetic barcodes into cells, enabling the reconstruction of lineage relationships across development. However, the current literature reveals a notable gap in the detailed discussion of technical challenges associated with CRISPR-based methods. For instance, off-target effects and the complexity of barcode interpretation remain underexplored, which may limit the reliability and accuracy of lineage reconstruction in complex biological systems [1].\n\nFurthermore, the long-term stability of CRISPR-derived barcodes is a critical concern, particularly in studies requiring extended tracking of cell lineages over multiple generations. While some studies have highlighted the potential of CRISPR-based lineage tracing as a versatile tool [5], they often fail to provide a comprehensive comparative analysis with alternative methods, such as integration barcoding. This lack of comparative data hinders the evaluation of CRISPR-based techniques in terms of reproducibility and scalability, which are essential for large-scale applications in developmental biology and disease modeling.\n\nIn contrast, other studies have focused on the integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with traditional lineage tracing methods, offering a broader framework for lineage trajectory analysis. These approaches, while less scalable than CRISPR-based techniques, provide a more established foundation for interpreting cellular heterogeneity and differentiation states. However, the extension of these frameworks to CRISPR-based lineage tracing remains an area of active research, with limited empirical validation reported in the literature [3].\n\nOverall, while CRISPR-based lineage tracing presents a promising avenue for high-resolution lineage reconstruction, the current body of research lacks sufficient depth in addressing its technical limitations and comparative performance. Future studies should prioritize the development of standardized protocols for barcode design, error correction, and long-term tracking, as well as systematic comparisons with existing lineage tracing modalities to establish best practices for the field.",

By combining lineage tracing with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), researchers can map the developmental origins of tumor cells and uncover the molecular mechanisms that drive clonal evolution and treatment resistance [3].\n\nThe application of these techniques has been particularly impactful in hematological malignancies, where single-cell lineage tracing (SCLT) has been used to track the clonal evolution of cancer cells and reveal the genetic diversity that underpins disease progression and relapse [5]. However, the broader applicability of these methods to solid tumors remains underexplored, highlighting a critical gap in the current literature. Moreover, while multi-omics integration has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the resolution of lineage tracing analyses, many studies lack the integration of lineage tracing methodologies that are essential for mapping clonal lineages and understanding the temporal dynamics of tumor evolution [6].\n\nThe interplay between tumor cells and the immune system is another critical area where lineage tracing combined with single-cell omics has provided valuable insights. By reconstructing cellular lineages and identifying distinct subpopulations of tumor cells with varying metastatic potential, these approaches have shed light on the mechanisms of immune evasion and tumor progression [5,6]. However, the current literature also highlights several limitations, including the computational complexity of analyzing large-scale multi-omics datasets and the limitations of current reporter systems in capturing the full dynamics of cell lineage and fate decisions [3].\n\nDespite these challenges, the potential of lineage tracing combined with single-cell omics to inform therapeutic strategies against metastasis and immune evasion is substantial. Future research should focus on refining methodologies for clonal reconstruction, improving data integration strategies, and validating these approaches in clinically relevant models. Additionally, there is a need for more systematic evaluation of the challenges associated with clinical implementation, such as sample scarcity and data complexity [5].

This issue is compounded by the potential biases introduced by pseudotemporal ordering algorithms, which may inadvertently generate artifacts that mimic true developmental paths. The paper emphasizes the critical need for experimental validation to distinguish between genuine biological trajectories and computational artifacts, underscoring the importance of cross-validation between computational and empirical approaches.\n\nAnother recurring limitation is the lack of uncertainty quantification in lineage reconstruction methods. This issue is particularly problematic because it hinders the interpretation of results and limits the confidence in inferred lineage relationships [2]. While some studies have proposed methods to address this, they often fail to provide a comprehensive evaluation of performance across diverse datasets, thereby limiting their generalizability. Additionally, the accuracy of lineage trajectory inference remains a challenge, with several papers pointing out the need for more precise and robust methodologies [3]. The suggestion of incorporating time-stamping information to improve prediction accuracy is promising, yet the absence of detailed solutions restricts the practical implementation of such approaches.\n\nThe integration of multi-omics data also presents significant challenges, particularly in terms of methodological robustness and conceptual clarity [6]. While this approach holds great potential for uncovering complex biological processes, the current literature lacks a unified framework for integrating lineage tracing with single-cell omics data. This gap is further exacerbated by the limited discussion of how to address the specific technical limitations of lineage tracing and single-cell omics techniques, which are often not the primary focus of multi-omics studies [6].\n\nMoreover, several papers highlight the need for improved computational tools and methodologies to enhance the resolution and accuracy of lineage tracing [5]. Despite these calls for innovation, few studies provide a detailed roadmap for addressing these limitations or propose concrete research directions. This lack of actionable strategies limits the field's ability to advance beyond current constraints. Similarly, while the challenges section in some papers is well-structured and comprehensive [1], it often falls short in offering insights into how these challenges can be systematically overcome.\n\nIn summary, while lineage tracing combined with single-cell omics has made significant strides in elucidating cellular dynamics, the field still faces substantial hurdles in terms of data reliability, computational accuracy, and methodological integration. Addressing these challenges requires not only the development of more robust analytical frameworks but also a stronger emphasis on experimental validation and interdisciplinary collaboration.

These models must also account for the inherent variability in single-cell measurements, which can introduce biases and reduce the reliability of lineage inference.\n\nAnother critical limitation concerns the reliability and resolution of lineage barcodes, which are essential for tracking cell lineage over time. Issues such as barcode saturation, low labeling efficiency, and off-target mutations in CRISPR-based systems have been identified as major obstacles to generating accurate lineage maps [5].

Moreover, the performance of trajectory analysis tools is highly dependent on the quality of input data, with poor-quality data leading to overfitting and unreliable lineage reconstructions [4].\n\nThe computational demands of reconstructing lineage trees from large single-cell datasets also pose a significant hurdle. Efficient algorithms are needed to process high-dimensional data without sacrificing accuracy or interpretability. While some studies have proposed improvements, such as the integration of time-stamping information to enhance the precision of lineage reconstructions [3], these approaches often lack concrete implementations or scalability analyses, particularly for large datasets [2].\n\nFurthermore, the field lacks a comprehensive characterization of existing methodologies, including the limitations of barcode resolution and the performance of computational algorithms across different tissue systems [1]. This gap highlights the need for more systematic benchmarking of lineage tracing techniques to guide their application in diverse experimental settings.\n\nIn summary, the technical limitations of lineage tracing combined with single-cell omics encompass challenges in computational modeling, barcode reliability, trajectory inference, and data scalability. Addressing these issues will require the development of more robust and generalizable algorithms, the integration of temporal information, and stronger validation of computational results through experimental approaches.

One of the primary obstacles is the computational complexity associated with handling high-dimensional single-cell data, which requires robust statistical models to extract meaningful biological insights [2,5]. These models must not only manage vast amounts of data but also account for the inherent noise and variability in single-cell measurements, which can significantly impact the reliability of lineage inference.\n\nAnother critical limitation lies in the resolution and reliability of lineage barcodes, which are essential for tracking cell lineage over time. Barcode saturation, low labeling efficiency, and the potential for off-target mutations in CRISPR-based lineage tracing systems have been identified as significant barriers to achieving accurate and comprehensive lineage maps [5]. Furthermore, the assignment of barcodes to individual cells is prone to errors, which can introduce biases in lineage reconstruction and compromise the validity of downstream analyses.\n\nThe sensitivity of lineage trajectory inference tools to data quality and the variability in their performance across different biological systems present additional challenges. Current algorithms often struggle with detecting lineage relationships when gene expression changes are large and abrupt, a common feature in complex developmental processes [1,3]. This limitation suggests that existing tools may not be universally applicable and may require customization or refinement for specific contexts.\n\nMoreover, the computational demands of reconstructing lineage trees from large single-cell datasets remain a significant hurdle.

This highlights the need for improved data preprocessing pipelines and more sophisticated computational frameworks that can better accommodate the complexity of single-cell omics data.\n\nIn summary, while lineage tracing combined with single-cell omics offers unprecedented opportunities for understanding cellular dynamics, the field is still constrained by several technical limitations. These include challenges in handling high-dimensional data, the reliability of lineage barcodes, the accuracy of trajectory inference, and the scalability of computational methods.

However, despite significant progress, the field still faces critical challenges that must be addressed to fully realize the potential of these combined approaches. Future directions in this area are broadly centered around three key themes: the enhancement of multi-omics integration, the improvement of spatial and temporal resolution, and the expansion of these methodologies into clinical and translational applications. These directions are not only driven by the need to overcome current technical limitations but also by the growing demand for more precise and actionable insights in both basic and applied biological research [1,4,6].\n\nOne of the most pressing needs in the field is the development of more robust and interpretable computational frameworks for integrating multi-omics data with lineage tracing. While the conceptual value of combining transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data with lineage information is widely recognized, the practical implementation of such integrative approaches remains underdeveloped. Current studies often lack detailed methodologies for data alignment, normalization, and model validation, which are essential for ensuring the reliability and reproducibility of lineage trajectory inference [1,5]. Furthermore, the absence of standardized protocols and shared data formats hinders the comparability of results across different studies, limiting the broader applicability of these methods. Future research should focus on creating unified computational pipelines that can seamlessly integrate diverse omics layers while maintaining biological interpretability and scalability.\n\nAnother critical area for future development is the enhancement of spatial and temporal resolution in lineage tracing methodologies. While single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides high-resolution transcriptomic data, it often lacks spatial context, which is essential for understanding how cell fate decisions are influenced by local microenvironments. The integration of spatial transcriptomics with lineage tracing has been proposed as a promising strategy to address this limitation, enabling the mapping of lineage trajectories within anatomical contexts [1,6]. However, the current literature frequently lacks a comprehensive technical evaluation of these methods, including their limitations and potential for improvement. Similarly, the need for higher temporal resolution to accurately reconstruct cell state transitions remains a major challenge, with many studies calling for the incorporation of time-stamping techniques to enhance the accuracy of lineage predictions [3]. Future work should focus on systematically addressing these challenges through the development of more robust and scalable approaches for spatial and temporal resolution.\n\nIn addition to technical improvements, there is a growing emphasis on expanding the application of lineage tracing combined with single-cell omics into clinical and translational settings. Several studies highlight the potential of these technologies in fields such as oncology and regenerative medicine, where they can be used to track clonal evolution in tumors, predict therapeutic responses, and reveal the hierarchical organization of stem and progenitor cells [1,5]. However, the translation of these methods into clinical practice is still in its early stages, with many studies focusing on proof-of-concept applications rather than large-scale validation. Future research should prioritize the development of clinically relevant protocols, the validation of lineage-based biomarkers, and the integration of these approaches into personalized medicine strategies.\n\nOverall, while the field of lineage tracing combined with single-cell omics has made significant strides, it remains at a critical juncture where further innovation and collaboration are essential. The development of more robust computational tools, the enhancement of spatial and temporal resolution, and the expansion into clinical applications represent key areas for future research.

Several studies emphasize the critical need for such resolution in capturing the complexity of cellular states during development and disease, especially in systems like hematopoiesis and tumor evolution [1,5]. High-resolution lineage tracing enables the reconstruction of cell fate decisions and lineage relationships, while single-cell omics provides detailed molecular profiles that complement these spatial and temporal insights.\n\nOne key challenge in lineage trajectory mapping is the accurate distinction between early and late cell states, which is essential for understanding developmental progression and disease progression. To address this, several studies propose the incorporation of time-stamping information into lineage tracing models, allowing for more precise reconstruction of cell lineage relationships and the identification of critical transition points [1,3]. This approach enhances the reliability of lineage predictions by accounting for the temporal dynamics of cellular states.\n\nSpatial resolution is another critical factor, particularly in the study of intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH). The dynamic nature of tumor evolution and microenvironmental interactions necessitates the use of spatially resolved techniques to capture the heterogeneity of cell populations within the tumor microenvironment. Techniques such as spatial transcriptomics and time-lapse imaging have been proposed as promising methods to achieve this level of resolution [5,6]. These methods enable the mapping of lineage relationships in the context of spatial organization, providing a more comprehensive view of cellular dynamics.\n\nThe combination of lineage tracing with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and other omics technologies has further advanced the field by enabling the integration of lineage information with gene expression profiles. This integration allows for the identification of gene regulatory networks and signaling pathways that govern cell fate decisions.

The combination of experimental lineage tracing with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has not only enhanced the accuracy of lineage reconstruction but also provided deeper insights into the molecular underpinnings of cellular differentiation and disease progression.\n\nComputational strategies have played a central role in this integration, with tools like ECLAIR demonstrating the potential to infer lineage relationships from high-dimensional single-cell data with improved statistical reliability [2]. However, the effectiveness of these algorithms depends on their validation through experimental approaches, highlighting the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration between computational and experimental researchers [4]. This synergy between data-driven modeling and empirical validation is essential for ensuring the biological relevance and robustness of lineage inference.\n\nThe application of multi-omics integration has further expanded the utility of lineage tracing, particularly in the context of intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) and cancer therapy development [6]. By combining lineage tracing with epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data, researchers can obtain a more comprehensive view of tumor evolution and therapeutic responses. This multi-layered approach not only enhances the resolution of lineage mapping but also facilitates the identification of biomarkers and therapeutic targets, advancing the prospects of personalized medicine.\n\nDespite these significant advancements, several challenges remain. These include the need for standardized data formats, improved algorithmic robustness, and better integration of lineage tracing with other omics layers to address complex biological questions. Furthermore, while many studies have focused on technical and methodological developments, there is a need for more forward-looking discussions on the broader implications of these tools for translational research and clinical applications [1,4,6].\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of lineage tracing with single-cell omics represents a paradigm shift in biological research, offering unprecedented opportunities to dissect cellular dynamics and disease mechanisms.

The combination of lineage tracing with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), for instance, has proven to be a powerful strategy for mapping lineage trajectories and identifying key regulatory events during development and disease [3]. Such integrative approaches not only enhance the accuracy of lineage reconstruction but also provide a more comprehensive view of cellular diversity and functional states.\n\nComputational strategies play a pivotal role in this integration, as they enable the inference of cell lineage from high-dimensional single-cell data. The development of robust algorithms, such as ECLAIR, has significantly advanced the field by providing quantitative estimates of prediction accuracy and improving the reliability of lineage reconstruction [2]. These tools are essential for handling the complexity and noise inherent in single-cell datasets, ensuring that the inferred lineage relationships are biologically meaningful and statistically sound. However, the effectiveness of these computational methods is contingent upon their integration with experimental validation, as highlighted in several studies that emphasize the importance of cross-validation between computational predictions and experimental data [4].\n\nIn the context of hematology, single-cell lineage tracing techniques (SCLT) have demonstrated significant potential for unraveling the cellular dynamics underlying hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis [5]. These techniques, when combined with single-cell omics, offer a powerful means to track the clonal evolution of blood cells and identify the molecular mechanisms driving cell fate decisions. The rapid evolution of SCLT underscores the need for continued methodological and computational advancements to fully harness its potential in both basic and translational research.\n\nMoreover, the application of integrated multi-omics strategies has been shown to be essential for addressing complex biological questions, particularly in the context of intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) and cancer therapy development [6].
