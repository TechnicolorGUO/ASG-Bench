School closures, which impacted 94% of the world’s student population, reached up to 99% in low- and lower-middle-income countries, underscoring the disproportionate impact on developing regions [4]. This global crisis has not only exacerbated existing educational inequalities but also highlighted the stark disparities between high-income and developing countries in terms of access to remote learning and the severity of school closures.\n\nIn high-income countries, such as those in the OECD, the transition to remote learning was facilitated by existing digital infrastructure, internet connectivity, and teacher training, although challenges still persisted [6]. In contrast, developing countries faced significant barriers, including limited access to digital devices, unreliable internet, and inadequate teacher preparedness for online instruction. These disparities are reflected in the findings of multiple studies, which emphasize that the educational disruption was more severe and prolonged in low-income regions, where pre-pandemic challenges such as underfunded schools, uneven resource distribution, and high dropout rates were already prevalent [1,3].\n\nSouth Asia, in particular, experienced some of the longest and most severe school closures, affecting over 430 million children [2]. The region was already grappling with a pre-existing learning crisis, with more than half of ten-year-olds unable to read a simple story before the pandemic. This situation worsened significantly, with the proportion of children unable to read increasing to 78% as a result of the disruptions. The pandemic not only exacerbated educational inequalities but also had profound implications for the mental health and well-being of students, particularly among marginalized girls and boys [2]. The long-term consequences of these disruptions are dire, with estimates suggesting that an entire generation of students could lose up to $1.9 trillion in future earnings if no urgent action is taken [2].\n\nThe global scale of the pandemic’s impact on education underscores the urgent need for coordinated policy responses to mitigate learning loss and prevent a generational catastrophe. While some governments and international organizations initiated measures to support remote learning and address educational disparities, the effectiveness of these responses varied widely, with many developing countries lacking the resources and infrastructure to implement comprehensive solutions [1,3]. The findings from these studies collectively highlight the critical role of education as a fundamental human right and a driver of sustainable development, emphasizing the necessity of targeted interventions to support recovery and resilience in the education sector.",

This data aligns with findings from [1], which reports that students in low-income regions experienced a decline of up to 30% in annual learning, particularly in reading and numeracy. These studies collectively highlight a widespread pattern of learning loss, with marginalized and disadvantaged groups bearing the brunt of the educational disruption.\n\nWhen comparing the severity of learning loss across regions, South Asia appears to have experienced particularly acute challenges. The data from [2] underscores that the pandemic has exacerbated existing educational disparities, with girls and rural populations facing greater barriers in accessing and utilizing digital learning tools. This is corroborated by [1], which notes that the impact was more severe for girls and students from marginalized communities, often due to limited access to remote learning. In contrast, while [5] acknowledges the differential impact on disadvantaged students, it lacks specific quantitative data or longitudinal studies to substantiate these claims, limiting its analytical depth.\n\nAccess to digital learning tools and teacher preparedness emerged as critical determinants of learning outcomes. The reports from [2] and [1] both emphasize that students in rural and low-income areas had limited access to digital infrastructure, which hindered their ability to continue learning during school closures. Additionally, the preparedness of teachers to implement remote learning strategies varied widely, with many educators lacking the necessary training or resources to support online instruction effectively. This lack of preparedness further contributed to the widening of educational gaps, particularly in regions with underdeveloped digital education frameworks.\n\nThe role of gender and socioeconomic status in shaping the impact of the pandemic on education is a recurring theme in the literature. Both [2] and [1] highlight that girls and students from low-income households were disproportionately affected. The former attributes this to greater challenges in accessing digital tools, while the latter notes that these students often faced additional household responsibilities that limited their time for remote learning. These findings suggest that the pandemic not only disrupted learning but also reinforced existing structural inequalities in education.\n\nWhile several studies provide valuable insights into the nature and extent of learning loss, the lack of longitudinal data remains a significant gap in the literature. For instance, [5] and [3] acknowledge the long-term implications of learning loss, such as reduced workforce readiness and increased economic inequality, but do not offer detailed analyses of these outcomes. This limitation underscores the need for future research that tracks the long-term effects of the pandemic on educational attainment and economic mobility in developing countries.\n\nIn summary, the evidence suggests that the pandemic has led to a substantial and uneven learning loss across developing countries, with South Asia experiencing some of the most severe impacts. Factors such as access to digital tools, teacher preparedness, and socioeconomic status played a pivotal role in shaping these outcomes, with marginalized groups, particularly girls, facing the greatest challenges. While the immediate effects of the pandemic on education are well-documented, the long-term consequences remain underexplored, necessitating further investigation to inform policy responses and recovery strategies.",

This paper highlights that while alternative methods such as radio, television, and printed materials were employed, they were often insufficient in reaching all students and lacked the interactive and structured nature of digital platforms. These limitations were particularly pronounced in regions where electricity and internet connectivity were unreliable, further compounding the challenges faced by students in remote areas.\n\nIn comparison, [1,3] both underscore the infrastructural constraints that hindered remote learning. These studies note that only a small percentage of students had access to digital platforms, with many relying on broadcast media such as radio and television. However, they do not provide in-depth analysis of the effectiveness or sustainability of these alternative methods. This gap in the literature suggests a need for more targeted research into the long-term viability of non-digital learning solutions, particularly in resource-constrained settings.\n\nThe global context of these challenges is further illuminated by [4], which outlines the varied responses of governments across different regions. While some countries implemented large-scale initiatives to distribute devices and improve internet access, others lacked the resources or policy frameworks to support such efforts. The brief emphasizes that the response to the disruption of education during the pandemic was uneven, with developing countries facing greater difficulties in maintaining continuity in learning. This global perspective underscores the importance of international collaboration and targeted policy interventions to address the systemic barriers to remote learning.\n\nIn South Asia, the challenges are particularly acute, as highlighted in regional studies. The lack of digital infrastructure, combined with socio-economic disparities, has created significant obstacles for students in both urban and rural areas. The reliance on broadcast methods, while a practical short-term solution, has proven inadequate in ensuring equitable access to education. Furthermore, the gender gap in access to digital resources has been a persistent issue, with girls often facing additional barriers due to cultural norms and limited household resources.\n\nOverall, the literature consistently points to the critical role of digital infrastructure and device access in shaping the effectiveness of remote learning. While alternative methods have been deployed, their reach and impact remain limited, particularly in the most disadvantaged communities. The findings from these studies collectively highlight the urgent need for comprehensive strategies that address both the technological and socio-economic dimensions of the digital divide in education.",

Among the reviewed papers, *the_road_to_learning_recovery* provides the most comprehensive analysis of the psychological impact on students, highlighting the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and social isolation. The report underscores the need for psychosocial support systems, emphasizing the roles of family, teachers, and community resources in mitigating these effects. It further stresses the importance of developing mental health strategies to ensure students are prepared to return to in-person learning, which aligns with the broader context outlined in *policy_brief_education_during_covid_19_and_beyond*.\n\nWhile *the_road_to_learning_recovery* offers specific insights into the psychological toll on students, other studies, such as *impact_of_covid_19_on_education_in_developing_countries* and *the_impact_of_covid_19_pandemic_on_education_system_in_developing_countries_a_review*, only briefly touch on mental health issues. These papers note increased reports of anxiety and social isolation but lack detailed data or in-depth analysis. Similarly, *the_lasting_impact_of_covid_19_on_education* and *distance_education_practices_during_the_covid_19_lockdown_comparison_of_belgium_japan_spain_and_türkiye* do not address the mental health of students at all, focusing instead on educational outcomes and policy responses.\n\nCommon themes across the literature include the psychological burden on students, particularly in marginalized communities, where access to mental health resources is often limited. The role of social support systems—such as family, teachers, and community organizations—emerges as a recurring point of emphasis, suggesting that these networks are crucial in buffering the negative effects of school disruptions. However, the extent to which these support systems are effective or accessible in developing countries remains underexplored in the existing literature.\n\nDespite these insights, several gaps in the research remain. Most studies provide only superficial coverage of mental health issues, lacking qualitative data, case studies, or longitudinal analysis. There is a clear need for further research into the long-term effects of mental health issues on academic performance and social development. Specifically, more studies are required to understand how prolonged psychological distress may affect students’ future educational attainment, employability, and overall well-being. Additionally, the effectiveness of interventions aimed at supporting student mental health during and after the pandemic requires more rigorous evaluation. Future research should also consider the intersection of mental health with other factors such as socioeconomic status, gender, and geographic location, to better address the needs of vulnerable student populations [1,2,3].",

      "content": "The global policy responses to the educational disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as outlined in the policy brief [4], emphasize the need for urgent measures such as emergency funding, teacher training, and the development of alternative learning models. These strategies reflect a broad, international consensus on the necessity of maintaining educational continuity during crises. However, the brief lacks detailed data or case studies on the effectiveness of these policies, which limits its analytical depth [4].\n\nIn contrast, the paper [2] presents the RAPID framework proposed by UNICEF, which offers a more structured approach to education recovery. This framework emphasizes reaching every child, assessing learning levels, prioritizing fundamental skills, and ensuring psychosocial well-being. It also underscores the importance of government and international collaboration, as well as sustained investment in recovery efforts. The RAPID framework highlights the need for context-specific interventions, which aligns with the regional and contextual challenges identified in other studies.\n\nSimilarly, [5] acknowledges the necessity of policy responses to address learning disruptions but does not provide detailed information on specific measures, such as funding allocations or teacher training initiatives. This absence of concrete examples and data on policy implementation is a common limitation across several studies, including [1] and [3], which focus more on describing policy actions rather than evaluating their effectiveness.\n\nA key commonality among these studies is the recognition of the importance of educational technology, zero-fee internet access, and broadcast-based learning as tools to mitigate the impact of school closures. These strategies were widely adopted, as noted in [3] and [1], but their implementation varied significantly across regions. For instance, the study on distance education practices in Belgium, Japan, Spain, and Türkiye [6] highlights the role of centralized decision-making in Türkiye, which contrasts with more decentralized approaches in other countries.\n\nDespite these efforts, a critical gap in policy implementation remains, particularly in addressing the needs of disadvantaged students. While the RAPID framework and the policy brief both acknowledge the importance of inclusivity, they do not provide detailed strategies for ensuring equitable access to education. This gap is further emphasized in [2], which stresses the need for targeted interventions to support vulnerable populations. The lack of sustained investment and data-driven monitoring mechanisms, as noted in multiple studies, further hinders the effectiveness of these policies.\n\nIn summary, while global policy responses have largely focused on emergency measures and alternative learning models, the implementation of these strategies has been inconsistent, particularly in developing countries. The RAPID framework offers a more comprehensive and context-sensitive approach, but its success depends on sustained collaboration, adequate funding, and a commitment to addressing systemic inequities in education. The absence of detailed evaluations of policy effectiveness across different regions underscores the need for more rigorous empirical research and long-term monitoring of educational reforms post-pandemic.",

While the study underscores the importance of education in mitigating these risks, it lacks specific data or models to quantify the economic and social impacts, which limits its applicability for policy formulation [5].\n\nIn contrast, *the_road_to_learning_recovery* offers a more concrete assessment of the economic ramifications, estimating that learning loss caused by the pandemic could result in a $1.9 trillion loss in future earnings for students in South Asia. This figure underscores the significant economic cost of educational disruptions and emphasizes the need for sustained investment in education recovery to ensure long-term social and economic stability. The report also highlights the interplay between learning loss, economic development, and social mobility, suggesting that educational recovery is not only a matter of academic concern but also a crucial component of broader economic resilience [2].\n\nOther studies, such as *impact_of_covid_19_on_education_in_developing_countries* and *the_impact_of_covid_19_pandemic_on_education_system_in_developing_countries_a_review*, provide a more general discussion of the long-term implications. These papers note the potential for increased inequality and reduced workforce readiness but fail to offer detailed projections or case studies on how disrupted education might affect future economic growth or social mobility. While they acknowledge the importance of education in mitigating these risks, their analyses remain limited in scope and depth, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of the long-term consequences [1,3].\n\nThe interplay between learning loss, economic development, and social mobility is a central theme in these discussions. Learning loss, particularly among disadvantaged students, can lead to reduced productivity and lower economic growth over time. This, in turn, may exacerbate existing inequalities and hinder social mobility, creating a cycle of disadvantage that is difficult to break. The findings from *the_road_to_learning_recovery* suggest that without targeted interventions, the economic costs of the pandemic's impact on education could persist for decades, affecting not only individual livelihoods but also national development trajectories.\n\nTo address these challenges, the literature points to several strategies for long-term recovery. Targeted interventions for disadvantaged students, such as additional tutoring, mental health support, and access to learning resources, are essential to mitigate the adverse effects of learning loss. Furthermore, the integration of digital learning into national education systems is increasingly seen as a necessary step to ensure continuity and equity in education. These strategies are not only about restoring pre-pandemic educational standards but also about building a more resilient and inclusive education system that can withstand future disruptions [2].\n\nIn conclusion, while the existing literature provides valuable insights into the long-term economic and social consequences of the pandemic on education, there remains a need for more detailed and data-driven analyses. Future research should focus on quantifying the economic costs of learning loss, exploring the mechanisms through which education influences social mobility, and evaluating the effectiveness of different recovery strategies. By doing so, policymakers and educators can develop more informed and effective responses to the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic.",

Notably, the papers [2,5] emphasize the need for more longitudinal studies to track the long-term effects of learning loss and its implications for students' academic and socio-economic trajectories. These studies also highlight the importance of qualitative research in capturing the nuanced experiences of students, teachers, and families during the pandemic. While both papers advocate for interdisciplinary approaches to address the multifaceted challenges of educational disruption, they do not provide concrete recommendations for future research methodologies or specific data collection strategies.\n\nSimilarly, the [4] underscores the necessity of longitudinal and qualitative research to understand the enduring effects of the pandemic on education systems. However, it, too, lacks detailed guidance on how to operationalize these research directions. The broader research gaps identified in this policy brief align with those outlined in other studies, such as the need for comparative analyses across countries and the evaluation of different distance education models, as noted in [6].\n\nOne of the most consistent limitations across the reviewed literature is the absence of specific recommendations for future research. While many papers call for more longitudinal and qualitative studies, they often fail to suggest concrete methodologies or frameworks for conducting such research. For example, [1,3] both identify the need for interdisciplinary collaboration but do not elaborate on how such collaboration might be structured or what specific disciplines should be involved.\n\nA key area for further research is the long-term effects of learning loss on economic outcomes. While some studies, such as [2], mention the importance of understanding these effects, none provide empirical evidence or theoretical models that link educational disruption to macroeconomic indicators. Similarly, the effectiveness of different policy interventions—such as remote learning strategies, mental health support, and technology-based solutions—remains underexplored. The lack of comprehensive evaluations of these interventions limits the ability of policymakers to make informed decisions.\n\nTo address these gaps, future research should adopt a mixed-methods approach that integrates quantitative and qualitative data. This would allow for a more holistic understanding of the pandemic's impact on education, combining statistical trends with in-depth narratives from stakeholders. Furthermore, interdisciplinary collaboration between education, economics, and public health fields is essential. Such collaboration could lead to more nuanced analyses of how educational disruptions intersect with broader socio-economic and health challenges, particularly in developing countries.\n\nIn conclusion, while the existing literature has made significant contributions to understanding the impact of the pandemic on education, it is clear that further research is needed to fill the identified gaps. Future studies should prioritize longitudinal designs, qualitative insights, and interdisciplinary frameworks to provide a more comprehensive picture of the long-term consequences of the pandemic on education systems in developing countries.",
