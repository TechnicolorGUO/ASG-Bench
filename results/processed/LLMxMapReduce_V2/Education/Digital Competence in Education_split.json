      "content": "The conceptual foundations of digital competence in education are characterized by a diverse and evolving set of definitions, frameworks, and contextual applications. At the core of this field lies the recognition that digital competence is not merely a technical skill set but a multifaceted construct encompassing knowledge, skills, attitudes, and strategic awareness. This section synthesizes the key insights from the literature, highlighting the conceptual diversity and the ongoing efforts to standardize and operationalize the concept within educational contexts.\n\nA central theme in the literature is the tension between holistic and context-specific definitions of digital competence. While some studies advocate for an integrative and comprehensive framework, others focus on specific domains such as higher education, primary schooling, or educator training. For instance, *Digital Competence in Education: A Comparative Analysis of Frameworks and Conceptual Foundations* presents a broad and inclusive definition, emphasizing the interplay of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and strategic awareness across personal, educational, professional, and societal contexts [4]. This definition reflects a growing consensus that digital competence must account for both technical and ethical dimensions, as well as the capacity for critical and creative engagement with digital environments.\n\nIn contrast, other studies adopt more focused definitions that align with specific educational settings. *Assessment of Digital Competencies in Higher Education Students: Development and Validation of a Measurement Scale* frames digital competence as the ability of students to use technology and digital media interactively to enhance their learning experiences, emphasizing the integration of knowledge, skills, and attitudes within academic contexts [2]. Similarly, *Development and Validation of Students’ Digital Competence Scale (SDiCoS)* underscores the importance of collaborative and creative use of digital technologies, particularly in the context of social media and mobile learning [5]. These definitions, while narrower in scope, reflect the increasing recognition of the social and ethical dimensions of digital competence.\n\nThe *Digital Competence Framework for Educators (DigCompEdu)* offers a structured and competency-based approach, organizing digital competence into six areas: Professional engagement, Digital resources, Teaching and learning, Assessment, Empowering learners, and Facilitating learners' digital competence [1]. This framework is specifically tailored for educators, highlighting the need for a pedagogical and strategic approach to digital integration. It aligns with the broader conceptual shift toward viewing digital competence as a dynamic and context-sensitive construct rather than a static set of technical skills.\n\nIn addition to these structured frameworks, the *Guide to Teaching Digital Literacy in Primary School* provides a distinct yet related perspective, defining digital literacy as the ability to find, evaluate, utilize, share, and create content using information technologies and the Internet [3]. While this definition focuses on literacy rather than competence, it underscores the importance of critical thinking, information evaluation, and responsible online behavior. The paper also distinguishes digital literacy from media literacy, emphasizing the technological focus of digital literacy and the role of digital citizenship in fostering ethical and respectful engagement with digital environments.\n\nDespite the variety of definitions and frameworks, there is a growing consensus on the need for a more unified and standardized approach to conceptualizing and measuring digital competence. However, many studies, including *Digital Competence in Education: A Comparative Analysis of Frameworks and Conceptual Foundations* and *Digital Competence in Education*, do not provide a detailed historical or chronological account of the evolution of the concept, focusing instead on current frameworks and their comparative analysis [4,6]. This gap in the literature suggests a need for further research into the conceptual and historical development of digital competence, which could inform more context-sensitive and effective educational practices.\n\nThe implications of this conceptual evolution are significant for both curriculum design and teacher training. Educators must now be equipped not only with technical skills but also with pedagogical strategies that promote critical digital literacy and ethical engagement. This necessitates a re-evaluation of existing teacher training programs and the integration of digital competence as a core competency within educational curricula. As the field continues to evolve, future research should address the historical and contextual dimensions of digital competence to support the development of more comprehensive and sustainable educational approaches.",

      "content": "The conceptualization of digital competence varies significantly across the literature, with some studies offering holistic frameworks while others adopt more narrow or context-specific definitions. The paper titled *Digital Competence in Education: A Comparative Analysis of Frameworks and Conceptual Foundations* presents a comprehensive and integrative definition, describing digital competence as the holistic ability to confidently, critically, and responsibly engage with digital technologies across personal, educational, professional, and societal contexts [4]. This definition encompasses four core dimensions: knowledge (understanding digital tools and systems), skills (technical, cognitive, and socio-emotional proficiencies), attitudes (responsibility, ethical judgment, adaptability, and resilience), and strategic awareness (critical evaluation, creativity, and problem-solving). This holistic approach emphasizes not only the technical capabilities required to use digital tools but also the ethical and cognitive dimensions necessary for effective and responsible digital engagement.\n\nIn contrast, other studies present more focused or context-specific definitions. For instance, *Assessment of Digital Competencies in Higher Education Students: Development and Validation of a Measurement Scale* defines digital competence as the ability of students to use technology and digital media interactively to enhance their learning experiences, emphasizing the integration of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and strategic awareness in academic settings [2]. While this definition aligns with broader conceptualizations, it is more narrowly oriented toward the educational context and practical application of digital tools in learning.\n\nSimilarly, *Development and Validation of Students’ Digital Competence Scale (SDiCoS)* defines digital competence as a person's ability to use digital technologies in a critical, collaborative, and creative way, along with the knowledge, skills, and attitude to be perceived as competent in a domain. The paper highlights the importance of integrating social media and mobile use into digital competence frameworks, as noted by the European Commission [5]. This definition places a strong emphasis on the social and collaborative aspects of digital competence, suggesting that it is not merely a set of technical skills but also involves interpersonal and ethical dimensions.\n\nThe paper *Digital Competence Framework for Educators (DigCompEdu)* offers a structured approach to digital competence, defining it as a set of 22 competences organized into six areas: Professional engagement, Digital resources, Teaching and learning, Assessment, Empowering learners, and Facilitating learners' digital competence [1]. While this framework is tailored specifically for educators, it reflects a similar emphasis on the integration of knowledge, skills, and attitudes, rather than focusing solely on technical proficiency.\n\nIn contrast, *Digital Competence in Education* does not provide a clear or detailed definition of digital competence, instead focusing on the practical application and assessment of digital skills. It implicitly refers to digital competence as the ability of educators to integrate digital tools into teaching and learning processes effectively, emphasizing strategic awareness and practical skills in digital environments [6]. This definition, while useful in the context of educational practice, lacks the conceptual depth found in more comprehensive frameworks.\n\nThe *Guide to Teaching Digital Literacy in Primary School* provides a distinct but related definition, describing digital literacy as \"the ability to find, evaluate, utilise, share, and create content using information technologies and the Internet\" [3]. While this definition is more focused on literacy rather than competence, it highlights key elements such as comprehension, interdependence, social factors, and curation. The paper also distinguishes digital literacy from media literacy, emphasizing the technological focus of digital literacy. Additionally, it defines digital citizenship as the ability to engage positively, critically, and competently in the digital environment, emphasizing responsible use of technology and respect for human rights and dignity.\n\nWhen comparing these definitions, it becomes evident that while some studies emphasize technical skills, others highlight critical thinking, ethical considerations, or a combination of these elements. The holistic approach described in *Digital Competence in Education: A Comparative Analysis of Frameworks and Conceptual Foundations* stands out for its comprehensive integration of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and strategic awareness. This contrasts with more narrow definitions that focus primarily on practical application or specific domains such as education or literacy. However, even the more narrow definitions often incorporate elements of critical thinking and ethical engagement, suggesting a growing recognition of the multidimensional nature of digital competence.\n\nIn summary, digital competence is framed in the educational context as a multifaceted construct that encompasses technical skills, critical thinking, ethical considerations, and strategic awareness. While some studies adopt a holistic and integrative approach, others focus on specific aspects or contexts. The diversity of definitions reflects the evolving nature of the concept and the need for further clarification and standardization in the field.",

      "content": "The evolution of digital competence in education reflects a significant shift from a narrow focus on technical skills to a more comprehensive, multi-dimensional understanding. This transformation is evident in the comparative analysis of the perspectives presented in [1,3]. The former emphasizes the broader implications of digital transformation in education, situating digital competence within the context of the European Commission’s Skills Agenda for Europe and the Europe 2020 initiative. It builds upon prior models such as the DigCompOrg framework and highlights the need for educators to develop a sophisticated set of competences that go beyond mere technical proficiency. In contrast, [3] underscores the importance of digital literacy in primary education, advocating for an approach that integrates critical thinking, information evaluation, and responsible online behavior alongside technical skills. This suggests a growing recognition that digital competence is not just about using tools, but about engaging with digital environments in a thoughtful and ethical manner.\n\nThe conceptual evolution of digital competence is further supported by the increasing emphasis on frameworks that address both the pedagogical and structural dimensions of digital integration. For instance, the development of measurement scales such as the Students’ Digital Competence Scale (SDICOS) in [5] illustrates a move toward more systematic and standardized approaches to assessing digital competence, particularly in response to the challenges posed by Emergency Remote Education (ERE) during the COVID-19 crisis. These developments align with the broader call for updated frameworks in higher education, as noted in [2], which stresses the necessity of adapting to the evolving technological landscape.\n\nDespite these advancements, many studies, including [4,6], do not provide a detailed historical or chronological account of how digital competence has evolved. Instead, they focus on current frameworks and their comparative analysis, indicating a gap in the literature regarding the conceptual and historical development of the field. This lack of historical context may hinder the development of more nuanced and context-sensitive approaches to curriculum design and teacher training.\n\nThe implications of this shift toward a more holistic understanding of digital competence are profound for both curriculum design and teacher training. Educators must now be equipped not only with technical skills but also with the pedagogical strategies necessary to foster critical digital literacy among students. This necessitates a re-evaluation of existing teacher training programs to ensure they incorporate the latest insights from digital competence frameworks. Furthermore, curriculum design must move beyond the mere inclusion of digital tools to integrate digital competence as a core competency, aligned with broader educational goals such as digital citizenship, ethical reasoning, and lifelong learning. As the field continues to evolve, it is essential that future research addresses the historical and contextual dimensions of digital competence to inform more effective and sustainable educational practices.",

      "content": "This section provides a comprehensive overview of the theoretical and conceptual foundations of digital competence in education, focusing on the development, comparison, and integration of existing frameworks. It begins by examining the core components of established models, such as the European Framework for the Digital Competence of Educators (DigCompEdu), which offers a structured, scientifically grounded approach to digital competence, encompassing 22 competences organized into six key areas: information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital content creation, safety, problem-solving, and teaching and learning. DigCompEdu is notable for its universal applicability across educational levels and its emphasis on the teacher’s role in integrating digital tools into pedagogical practices [1].\n\nA comparative analysis of multiple frameworks, including the Norwegian Framework, ICT CFT, DTPF, SFDCT, and EDCF, reveals both commonalities and divergences in how digital competence is conceptualized and operationalized. While all frameworks recognize the importance of structured, measurable competencies and the teacher’s pivotal role, they differ in their scope, emphasis, and contextual applicability. For instance, the Norwegian Framework places greater emphasis on socio-emotional skills and collaborative practices, whereas the ICT CFT prioritizes technical and pedagogical integration of information and communication technologies (ICTs). The DTPF and SFDCT, in contrast, incorporate ethical and reflective dimensions into the development of digital competence [4].\n\nDespite the theoretical robustness of frameworks like DigCompEdu, several limitations have been identified. These include a lack of adaptability to emerging digital practices such as social media and mobile technologies, as well as insufficient attention to socio-emotional and ethical dimensions in some models. The development of new measurement tools, such as the Students’ Digital Competence Scale (SDICOS), highlights the need for frameworks to evolve in response to changing technological and educational landscapes [5].\n\nThe comparative analysis also underscores the importance of empirical validation and practical applicability. While qualitative insights provide a foundation for understanding the diversity of frameworks, the lack of case studies and empirical evidence in some papers limits the depth of their contributions. Future frameworks should aim to bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical implementation by incorporating empirical validation, context-specific adaptations, and a more holistic integration of ethical, pedagogical, and socio-emotional dimensions. This will ensure that digital competence frameworks remain relevant and effective in addressing the evolving demands of digital education.",

DigCompEdu, as detailed in its respective paper [1], provides a comprehensive and scientifically grounded model comprising 22 competences organized into six key areas: information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital content creation, safety, problem-solving, and teaching and learning. This framework is explicitly designed to be applicable across all educational levels, including early childhood, higher education, and non-formal learning contexts. Its emphasis on teacher roles is central, as it aims to equip educators with the necessary skills to integrate digital tools effectively into pedagogical practices.\n\nIn contrast, the comparative analysis in *digital_competence_in_education_a_comparative_analysis_of_frameworks_and_conceptual_foundations* reviews six frameworks: DigCompEdu, the Norwegian Framework, ICT CFT, DTPF, SFDCT, and EDCF. While it acknowledges the foundational role of DigCompEdu, it also highlights the diversity in how different frameworks conceptualize and operationalize digital competence. For instance, the Norwegian Framework places greater emphasis on socio-emotional skills and collaborative practices, whereas the ICT CFT focuses more on the technical and pedagogical integration of information and communication technologies (ICTs). The DTPF and SFDCT, on the other hand, incorporate a more holistic view, integrating ethical considerations and reflective practices into the development of digital competence.\n\nCommonalities between these frameworks include the recognition of the teacher's pivotal role in fostering digital competence and the need for structured, measurable competencies. However, differences emerge in their scope, emphasis, and application. DigCompEdu, for example, is more universally applicable and theoretically robust, while the comparative analysis underscores the importance of context-specific adaptations, particularly in varying educational systems and cultural environments. The inclusion of socio-emotional skills and ethical considerations is more pronounced in some frameworks than others, suggesting a gap in the current literature regarding the holistic development of digital competence.\n\nThe analysis also reveals that while DigCompEdu provides a strong theoretical foundation, it may not fully address the evolving nature of digital practices, such as the increasing use of social media and mobile technologies. This gap is acknowledged in the paper that references the European Commission's emphasis on these areas [5], which highlights the need for frameworks to adapt to new digital environments. Thus, while DigCompEdu remains a cornerstone in the field, its application in specific educational contexts may benefit from supplementary models that incorporate more contemporary digital practices.\n\nIn summary, the comparative analysis of these frameworks reveals a spectrum of approaches to digital competence, each with its own strengths and limitations. DigCompEdu offers a broad, scientifically grounded model, while other frameworks provide more context-specific or specialized insights. The integration of socio-emotional and ethical dimensions, as well as the adaptation to emerging digital tools, remains a critical area for future development in the field.",

Among the available literature, the paper [4] stands out as the primary source offering a qualitative comparative analysis of six frameworks. This study identifies commonalities and differences in key areas such as collaboration, ethical practices, digital tool integration, and continuous professional development. The authors note that while all frameworks aim to address the digital skills gap in education, they differ in their emphasis, structure, and applicability across educational levels and contexts.\n\nFor instance, some frameworks prioritize technical proficiency, while others emphasize pedagogical integration or ethical considerations. The analysis highlights that frameworks like DigCompEdu [1] focus on structured competencies for educators, yet they lack comparative evaluation against other models, limiting the depth of insight into their relative strengths and weaknesses. Similarly, the development of new scales, such as the SDICOS [5], suggests that existing frameworks may not fully capture emerging digital skills or socio-technological innovations, indicating a gap in current conceptualizations.\n\nDespite the qualitative insights provided, the lack of empirical validation or case studies in [4] limits the practical applicability of its findings. Other papers, such as [3], [2], and [6], do not contribute to the comparative analysis, as they either focus on specific educational contexts or the development of measurement tools rather than framework evaluation.\n\nBased on the comparative insights, a synthesis of the most effective components across frameworks could enhance future digital competence development. Key elements include structured competency models, integration of ethical and pedagogical dimensions, and adaptability to diverse educational settings. Future frameworks should aim to bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical implementation, incorporating empirical validation and case-based evidence to support their efficacy. This approach would not only improve the relevance of digital competence frameworks but also ensure their alignment with evolving educational and technological demands.",

      "content": "Digital competence in education is a multifaceted construct that varies significantly across different educational contexts, necessitating tailored approaches to its development, assessment, and integration into pedagogical practices. This section synthesizes the existing literature to provide a comprehensive overview of how digital competence is conceptualized and addressed in primary and higher education, highlighting both the commonalities and the distinct challenges in each context. The analysis reveals that while digital competence is increasingly recognized as a critical skill across all levels of education, the specific needs, pedagogical strategies, and institutional support structures differ substantially between primary and higher education.\n\nIn primary education, the development of digital competence is closely tied to the cognitive and social-emotional development of young learners. The paper *guide_to_teaching_digital_literacy_in_primary_school* emphasizes the importance of age-appropriate digital tools, such as educational apps and games, which align with the motivational and cognitive characteristics of primary school children. However, the literature on digital competence in this context remains limited, with most studies focusing on higher education or general educator frameworks [4,6]. This gap highlights the need for more research that addresses the unique challenges faced by primary educators, including the lack of teacher confidence in digital skills and the difficulty of aligning digital literacy with curricular goals.\n\nIn contrast, higher education has seen a growing emphasis on the assessment of digital competence, particularly in the context of online learning and remote education. Two key studies, *assessment_of_digital_competencies_in_higher_education_students_development_and_validation_of_a_measurement_scale* and *development_and_validation_of_students_digital_competence_scale_sdicos*, provide valuable insights into the development and validation of measurement scales for evaluating digital competence among university students. These studies propose distinct conceptualizations of digital competence, with one emphasizing a four-dimensional framework encompassing communication, content management, digital creation, and digital empathy, and the other focusing on practical applications such as online collaboration, social media use, and data protection. Despite their contributions, both studies acknowledge limitations, including the lack of integration with curriculum design and the limited exploration of cross-contextual applicability [2,5].\n\nThe comparative analysis of these studies underscores the ongoing challenges in defining and operationalizing digital competence in higher education. The absence of a unified framework complicates the comparison of findings and limits the generalizability of assessment tools. Moreover, the lack of longitudinal research and the limited attention to institutional support structures further constrain the understanding of how digital competence develops and is sustained over time. These gaps suggest that future research should prioritize the development of context-sensitive assessment instruments, the integration of digital competence into curricula, and the exploration of the role of institutional policies in fostering digital literacy.\n\nOverall, the section highlights the importance of context-specific approaches to digital competence in education. While primary education requires a focus on foundational digital skills and age-appropriate pedagogical strategies, higher education demands a more sophisticated understanding of digital competence in the context of academic and professional development. The existing literature provides a foundation for further research, but significant gaps remain, particularly in terms of longitudinal studies, cross-contextual comparisons, and the integration of digital competence into broader educational frameworks.",

It identifies several key barriers, including teachers' lack of confidence in digital skills, the difficulty of aligning digital literacy with existing curricula, and the pressure from government guidelines. These findings highlight the complex interplay between pedagogical practices, institutional expectations, and the developmental needs of young students. The paper further suggests practical strategies for integrating digital literacy, such as the use of online tools, educational apps, and games, which are particularly suited to the cognitive and motivational characteristics of primary school children. It also underscores the importance of teacher support and professional development, as well as the cultivation of digital citizenship and responsible online behavior, which are critical for young learners navigating the digital world [3].\n\nWhile this paper offers a detailed exploration of primary education, other studies in the broader literature on digital competence do not specifically address this context. For instance, *assessment_of_digital_competencies_in_higher_education_students_development_and_validation_of_a_measurement_scale* and *development_and_validation_of_students_digital_competence_scale_sdicos* focus exclusively on higher education students, with no mention of early childhood or primary education settings [2,5]. Similarly, *digital_competence_in_education* and *digital_competence_in_education_a_comparative_analysis_of_frameworks_and_conceptual_foundations* examine digital competence in higher education or general educator frameworks, without providing insights specific to primary school environments [4,6]. *digital_competence_framework_for_educators_digcompedu* acknowledges the applicability of its framework across all education levels, including early childhood, but lacks detailed pedagogical strategies or challenges specific to primary education [1].\n\nThis absence of primary education-specific research in the broader conceptual frameworks suggests that the current literature on digital competence tends to prioritize higher education or general educator competencies, leaving a gap in the understanding of how digital literacy is developed in the early years. The insights from *guide_to_teaching_digital_literacy_in_primary_school* thus serve as a critical contribution to the field, offering a nuanced perspective on the unique pedagogical and institutional challenges faced in primary education. By comparing these findings with the broader literature, it becomes evident that while digital competence is increasingly recognized as a vital skill across all education levels, the specific needs and contexts of primary education require targeted research, policy, and pedagogical approaches that are not yet fully addressed in existing frameworks.",

Two key studies, [2,5], provide critical insights into the development and validation of measurement scales for evaluating digital competence among university students. These studies represent some of the few focused efforts in this area, given that many other papers either concentrate on primary education or emphasize frameworks for educators rather than students.\n\nThe study by [2] defines digital competence in the context of higher education and outlines a four-dimensional scale: Communication and digital security, Access to digital content management, Creation of digital content and use of digital media, and Digital empathy. The authors emphasize the importance of psychometric validation, reporting on the scale's reliability and validity through statistical analyses. Their methodology is grounded in a structured survey design, with a focus on both theoretical and practical dimensions of digital competence. This approach enables a comprehensive evaluation of students' abilities across multiple facets of digital engagement.\n\nIn contrast, [5] proposes a different framework, emphasizing components such as online learning and collaboration, social media, smart and mobile devices, safety, and data protection. While this scale also aims to assess digital competence, it places a stronger emphasis on the practical application of digital tools in academic settings. The study highlights the relevance of digital competence for the design of remote education strategies, suggesting that such assessments can inform pedagogical approaches and curriculum development. The methodology employed in this study also involves survey-based data collection, but with a more applied focus, reflecting the evolving nature of digital learning environments.\n\nComparing the two studies, both adopt survey-based methodologies and emphasize the importance of psychometric validation. However, their conceptualizations of digital competence differ, with the first study offering a more theoretical and holistic framework, while the second focuses on the practical and technological aspects of digital engagement. These differences reflect the broader challenge in the field of defining and operationalizing digital competence in higher education. The lack of a unified framework complicates comparative analysis and limits the generalizability of findings across different contexts.\n\nDespite their contributions, both studies acknowledge limitations in their approaches. For instance, neither study provides a detailed discussion on how digital competence is developed or integrated into curricula, as noted in the digest of [6]. Additionally, while both studies validate their scales, the generalizability of these tools to diverse institutional and cultural contexts remains unexplored. This gap highlights the need for further research that examines the adaptability and cross-contextual applicability of digital competence assessment instruments.\n\nFuture research should address these gaps by exploring longitudinal studies that track the development of digital competence over time, as well as comparative analyses across different educational systems. Moreover, there is a need to integrate digital competence assessment with curriculum design, ensuring that it is not treated as a separate competency but as an essential component of higher education. Finally, the role of institutional policies and support structures in fostering digital competence should be investigated, as these factors significantly influence students' ability to engage effectively with digital tools.",

This section synthesizes the current state of methodologies, challenges, and limitations in assessing digital competence, drawing on empirical studies and theoretical frameworks that have contributed to the field. The discussion is structured around the development of measurement scales, the challenges inherent in assessment practices, and the need for more standardized, context-sensitive, and validated tools.\n\nThe methodologies for assessing digital competence vary significantly, reflecting the multidimensional and context-dependent nature of the construct. Studies such as [2,5] present distinct yet complementary approaches. The former introduces a 22-item scale with a multidimensional structure, validated through advanced statistical techniques including ESEM and bifactor modeling, highlighting the complexity of digital competence as a latent construct. The latter develops a 28-item scale organized into six components, emphasizing practical and socio-emotional dimensions of digital skills, and demonstrating strong reliability and validity in a higher education context. These studies illustrate the importance of tailoring assessment tools to specific educational levels and institutional goals, whether theoretical, practical, or policy-oriented.\n\nBeyond these, alternative approaches such as the SELFIEforTEACHERS self-reflection tool [1] and survey-based methods [6] offer different perspectives, though they often lack detailed validation or comprehensive empirical support. This variability underscores the need for more rigorous and standardized assessment instruments that can be applied across diverse educational contexts. Additionally, the lack of assessment tools in certain areas, such as primary education and conceptual analyses [3,4], reveals a significant gap in the literature, particularly in terms of empirical validation and practical implementation.\n\nChallenges in the assessment of digital competence include the rapid evolution of digital technologies, which necessitates continuous updates to measurement tools, and the reliance on self-reporting instruments, which are prone to biases and lack objective validation [2,5]. The absence of a unified framework for assessment also hinders comparative analysis and the development of equitable evaluation criteria. Furthermore, demographic factors such as field of study, computer experience, and age significantly influence digital competence, yet many existing scales fail to account for this variability, potentially leading to biased or incomplete assessments [5]. While gender was found to have no significant impact on digital competence in one study, this does not justify the exclusion of other individual differences in assessment design.\n\nTo address these limitations, future research should prioritize the development of standardized, cross-cultural, and empirically validated assessment instruments that integrate both quantitative and qualitative methods. A more holistic approach, incorporating performance-based tasks, observational evaluations, and technology-enhanced assessments, could enhance the depth and accuracy of digital competence measurement. Additionally, assessment frameworks must be adaptable to the evolving digital landscape and sensitive to cultural and contextual factors. By addressing these challenges, educational institutions can better support the development of digital competence in students and educators, ensuring that assessment practices are both equitable and effective.",

      "content": "The assessment of digital competence has been approached through various methodologies, with a particular focus on developing and validating measurement scales for higher education students. Two key studies, [2,5], present distinct yet complementary approaches to this task. The first study introduces a 22-item measurement scale, emphasizing a multidimensional structure of digital competence. The development process involved a literature review and rigorous statistical validation, including Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM), bifactor-CFA, and bifactor-ESEM. The ESEM model was found to provide the best fit, suggesting that digital competence is a complex and multifaceted construct that cannot be adequately captured by unidimensional models [2].\n\nIn contrast, the study presented in [5] develops a more comprehensive 28-item scale, organized into six distinct components: online learning and collaboration, social media, smart and mobile devices, safety, and data protection. The scale was validated through a sample of 156 higher education students, with results demonstrating strong model fit, factor loadings, internal validity, and reliability. This approach reflects a more holistic understanding of digital competence, incorporating both technical and socio-emotional dimensions, and is particularly suited for contexts where a broad and structured assessment is required, such as in higher education institutions [5].\n\nWhile both studies focus on higher education, their methodologies highlight the need for context-specific assessment tools. The first study’s emphasis on statistical modeling and factor analysis offers a robust framework for understanding the latent structure of digital competence, making it suitable for research-oriented settings. The second study’s broader component-based structure, on the other hand, is more adaptable to practical applications, such as curriculum design or institutional evaluation. These differences suggest that the choice of assessment method should be guided by the specific goals of the evaluation, whether they are theoretical, practical, or policy-driven.\n\nBeyond these two studies, other papers in the literature provide alternative or supplementary approaches. For instance, [1] introduces the SELFIEforTEACHERS self-reflection tool, which is designed for educators rather than students. This tool, available in 24 EU languages, allows for self-assessment and reflection on digital competence, but lacks detailed descriptions of its design and validation beyond its general applicability. In contrast, [6] presents a survey-based method that relies on self-reported skills and knowledge, using Likert-scale questions and demographic data. While this method is straightforward and easy to implement, it does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the tool’s validity or reliability, which limits its utility for rigorous academic research [6].\n\nThe lack of assessment methods in other papers, such as [3,4], underscores a gap in the literature, particularly at the primary education level and in conceptual analyses. These studies focus more on frameworks and theoretical foundations rather than on practical measurement techniques, indicating a need for more empirical research into assessment methods across different educational levels.\n\nCommon challenges in the assessment of digital competence include the multidimensionality of the construct, the need for culturally and contextually appropriate tools, and the difficulty of capturing both technical and socio-emotional aspects of digital skills. Additionally, many assessment tools lack comprehensive validation, which can undermine their reliability and generalizability. To address these issues, future research should prioritize the development of standardized, cross-cultural assessment instruments that are both theoretically grounded and empirically validated. Integrating mixed-methods approaches—combining quantitative surveys with qualitative insights—may also enhance the depth and accuracy of digital competence assessments, particularly in diverse educational settings.",

      "content": "The assessment of digital competence in education faces significant challenges, as highlighted by several studies. A recurring issue is the dynamic nature of digital technologies, which makes it difficult for existing assessment frameworks to remain relevant and effective over time [5]. This rapid evolution necessitates continuous updates to measurement tools, yet many current scales fail to incorporate emerging digital skills or socio-technological innovations, leading to incomplete or outdated assessments [2,5].\n\nAnother critical limitation is the reliance on self-reporting instruments, such as surveys, which are prone to biases and lack objective measures. For instance, one study emphasizes that self-reported data may not accurately reflect actual digital skills, particularly when assessing real-world application or practical competencies [6]. This methodological constraint limits the validity and reliability of assessments, as it is difficult to verify the accuracy of participants' responses.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of standardization across assessment tools presents a major barrier to equitable evaluation. While some studies acknowledge the need for culturally and contextually appropriate measurement instruments, they do not provide detailed discussions on how to address variability in assessment practices across different educational settings [2]. This absence of a unified framework hinders comparative analysis and the development of universally applicable assessment criteria.\n\nFurthermore, the influence of demographic factors such as field of study, computer experience, and age on digital competence underscores the need for more nuanced and adaptive assessment methods. These factors can significantly affect an individual’s digital proficiency, yet many existing scales do not account for such variability, potentially leading to biased or incomplete evaluations [5]. Gender, on the other hand, was found to have no significant impact on digital competence in one study, suggesting that assessment tools should not be designed with gender-based assumptions [5].\n\nTo address these limitations, a more effective and equitable assessment framework should integrate multiple assessment modalities, including performance-based tasks, observational evaluations, and technology-enhanced assessments. Such a framework should also incorporate continuous updates to reflect the evolving digital landscape and ensure cultural and contextual relevance. Moreover, it should account for individual differences in digital experience and background, while minimizing biases inherent in self-reporting methods. By adopting a more holistic and adaptive approach, educational institutions can better measure and support the development of digital competence in students and educators alike.",

Emerging trends and innovations, such as the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and personalized learning, are increasingly recognized as pivotal in shaping the future of digital competence frameworks. The study by [5] underscores the necessity of incorporating these technologies into educational practices, suggesting that digital competence must become more adaptive and technology-driven. However, while some studies acknowledge the potential of these innovations, they often lack detailed analyses of their practical implications, indicating a critical research gap that requires further exploration [6].\n\nIn addition to technological advancements, the section emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary and cross-cultural perspectives in the development of digital competence models. The current literature predominantly focuses on localized frameworks and specific educational contexts, with limited attention to how cultural, institutional, and pedagogical differences influence the conceptualization and implementation of digital competence. The paper [4] highlights the need for a more holistic approach that integrates insights from educational theory, psychology, and policy analysis. This call for interdisciplinary integration is further supported by the suggestion that future research should prioritize cross-cultural comparative studies to ensure that digital competence frameworks are both culturally responsive and universally applicable.\n\nThe section also identifies key challenges in the current research landscape, including the limited scope of existing studies, methodological constraints, and the lack of longitudinal data on how digital competence evolves across different cultural and institutional settings. To address these challenges, future research should focus on developing more inclusive models that account for diverse educational environments, as well as on investigating the long-term impacts of emerging technologies on teaching and learning. Furthermore, there is a pressing need for more robust measurement tools that can accurately assess the dynamic and multifaceted nature of digital competence across different populations and contexts. By addressing these gaps, the academic community can contribute to the development of more effective, equitable, and future-oriented digital competence frameworks in education.",

      "content": "While many of the referenced papers do not explicitly address emerging trends or innovations in digital competence, a few key contributions provide valuable insights into how digital competence is evolving in response to technological and societal changes. Notably, the study by [5] suggests that future research should focus on the integration of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR), into digital competence frameworks. This study also emphasizes the importance of understanding the impact of global digital transformation on educational practices and highlights the growing need for personalized learning approaches. These findings indicate a shift toward more adaptive and technology-enhanced models of digital competence.\n\nSimilarly, the paper [6] briefly mentions the role of emerging technologies such as AI and VR in shaping future digital competence requirements. It suggests that these technologies may redefine the skills needed for effective digital teaching and learning. However, it stops short of providing a detailed analysis of how these innovations could influence educational practices or digital competence frameworks. This gap highlights the need for more in-depth research on the practical implications of integrating such technologies into educational settings.\n\nIn contrast, the papers [1], [3], [4], and [2] do not provide detailed information on emerging trends or innovations in digital competence. These works primarily focus on the current state of frameworks, conceptual foundations, or measurement tools, rather than projecting future developments or analyzing the impact of new technologies.\n\nDespite these limitations, the insights from [5] and [6] suggest that digital competence is increasingly being seen as a dynamic and evolving construct. As technological advancements continue to reshape educational landscapes, there is a growing recognition of the need for flexible, technology-integrated frameworks that can accommodate new tools and pedagogical approaches.\n\nFor educators, this evolution implies a need to stay updated with emerging technologies and to adapt their teaching strategies accordingly. Students, on the other hand, may benefit from more personalized and technology-enhanced learning experiences. For policymakers, these trends underscore the importance of investing in digital infrastructure, teacher training, and curriculum development to ensure that educational systems are prepared for the future. Overall, while the current body of literature provides limited direct discussion on emerging trends, the direction of future research and practice is increasingly aligned with the integration of AI, VR, and personalized learning into digital competence frameworks.",

      "level": 3,
      "content": "Despite the increasing recognition of digital competence as a critical skill in education, the existing literature reveals a significant gap in addressing its interdisciplinary and cross-cultural dimensions. The paper [4] provides a comprehensive review of digital competence frameworks but does not explore how different cultural and educational contexts influence the conceptualization and application of digital competence. This omission highlights a critical limitation in the current body of research, as the understanding of digital competence is inherently shaped by sociocultural, institutional, and pedagogical factors.\n\nSimilarly, several other studies, including [1], [3], and [6], focus primarily on specific educational contexts without considering the broader implications of cross-cultural variations. These studies often operate within a single national or regional framework, which restricts their applicability to diverse settings. For instance, the European Commission’s  framework is developed with a European context in mind, yet it lacks explicit consideration of how digital competence might be interpreted or implemented in non-European educational systems. This narrow focus limits the generalizability of findings and the potential for global policy alignment.\n\nWhile most of the reviewed papers do not directly address interdisciplinary or cross-cultural perspectives, [5] offers a subtle but important insight. Although it does not explicitly explore these dimensions, it suggests that future research should integrate educational theory, psychology, and policy analysis to better understand digital competence in diverse contexts. This call for interdisciplinary integration underscores the need for more holistic approaches that consider not only technical skills but also cognitive, affective, and socio-cultural factors.\n\nThe absence of cross-cultural analysis in the majority of studies is particularly concerning, as digital competence is not a universal construct. Cultural values, educational traditions, and technological infrastructures vary significantly across regions, which in turn affect how digital skills are prioritized, taught, and assessed. For example, in some cultures, collaborative learning and digital collaboration may be emphasized more than individualistic digital literacy, which can influence the design of digital competence frameworks. Without cross-cultural comparative studies, it is difficult to determine whether the constructs and assessments of digital competence are culturally neutral or biased toward specific paradigms.\n\nTo bridge these theoretical and practical gaps, future research should prioritize the development of cross-cultural and interdisciplinary models of digital competence. This could involve comparative studies across multiple educational systems, the inclusion of diverse cultural perspectives in framework development, and the integration of insights from disciplines such as sociology, psychology, and educational policy. Additionally, longitudinal studies could help trace how digital competence evolves in different cultural and institutional settings, providing a more nuanced understanding of its role in education.\n\nIn conclusion, while the current literature on digital competence in education provides valuable insights into its conceptual and practical dimensions, it falls short in addressing the interdisciplinary and cross-cultural aspects that are essential for a comprehensive understanding. Future research must move beyond localized frameworks and adopt a more inclusive, globally informed approach to digital competence, ensuring that it is both culturally responsive and academically rigorous.",
