      "content": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has long been recognized for its role in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, with historical applications in managing outbreaks such as SARS and H1N1 influenza. Its integration into the clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infections has been particularly prominent, with a significant proportion of patients receiving TCM alongside conventional therapies, reflecting its perceived efficacy and widespread acceptance in China [1]. This section provides an overview of TCM's foundational principles, its historical context in epidemic management, and its current application in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, while also highlighting the scientific and methodological challenges that remain in evaluating its therapeutic potential.\n\nThe theoretical framework of TCM is grounded in concepts such as \"holism\" and \"syndrome differentiation and treatment,\" which emphasize the balance of the body's internal environment and the enhancement of immune function. These principles are considered particularly relevant in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infections, where immune dysregulation and systemic inflammation are key pathophysiological features [3]. Specific TCM formulations, including Lianhua Qingwen, Jianhua Qinggan Granule, and Xuebijing injection, have been incorporated into national treatment guidelines, indicating a level of institutional validation and clinical application [4].\n\nThe historical use of TCM in managing viral outbreaks, such as SARS, has provided a basis for its application in the current pandemic, with researchers drawing on past experiences to inform contemporary treatment strategies [1]. However, the mechanisms by which TCM exerts its effects on SARS-CoV-2 remain incompletely understood, and there is a need for more rigorous scientific investigation to elucidate its biological pathways. Network pharmacology, systems biology, and \"omics\" approaches have been proposed as promising tools for this purpose, offering a more systematic and integrative understanding of TCM's therapeutic potential [6].\n\nThe integration of TCM with Western medicine has been a key strategy in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly in China, where a combined approach is based on principles of early detection, early quarantine, and early treatment. This dual-modality strategy seeks to leverage the complementary strengths of both systems, with TCM providing support in symptom management and immune modulation [2]. Despite its clinical use, the evidence supporting TCM's efficacy in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections remains evolving, with meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials suggesting potential benefits but also highlighting methodological limitations and variability in study designs [7].\n\nWhile TCM is recognized for its anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunoregulatory properties, the theoretical and historical depth of its application in the context of SARS-CoV-2 remains underdeveloped in many studies. Some papers fail to situate TCM within its broader philosophical and diagnostic framework, limiting the analytical depth of their discussions [1,3]. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive historical case studies that could strengthen the argument for TCM's relevance to the current pandemic. Furthermore, comparative analyses between TCM and Western medical approaches are largely absent, hindering a nuanced understanding of TCM's role in pandemic response.\n\nIn conclusion, while TCM has demonstrated significant clinical application in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the need for a more rigorous, interdisciplinary, and theoretically grounded approach to its evaluation remains critical. Future research should address the gaps in understanding TCM's mechanisms, historical context, and comparative effectiveness, while also advancing the integration of TCM into evidence-based public health strategies.",

The historical context of TCM in managing epidemics is well documented, with its inclusion in national guidelines for the prevention and control of COVID-19 reflecting its perceived efficacy and integration into public health strategies [5]. TCM's application in SARS-CoV-2 infections has been particularly notable, with over 85% of patients receiving TCM alongside conventional care, highlighting its widespread adoption in clinical practice [1].\n\nThe theoretical foundations of TCM are rooted in principles such as \"holism\" and \"syndrome differentiation and treatment,\" which guide its application in disease management. These principles emphasize the importance of balancing the body's internal environment and enhancing immune function, which are particularly relevant to the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infections [3]. Specific formulations such as Lianhua Qingwen, Jianhua Qinggan Granule, and Xuebijing injection have been incorporated into standard treatment guidelines, indicating a level of institutional recognition and clinical validation [4].\n\nDespite its widespread use, the mechanisms by which TCM exerts its effects on SARS-CoV-2 remain incompletely understood. Some studies suggest that TCM may influence the disease through hematologic and immunologic responses, though further research is needed to elucidate these pathways [6]. Network pharmacology, systems biology, and \"omics\" research have been proposed as valuable tools for unraveling the complex interactions between TCM components and the SARS-CoV-2 virus, offering a more systematic approach to understanding its therapeutic potential.\n\nThe integration of TCM with Western medicine has been a key strategy in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infections in China, based on principles of early detection, early quarantine, and early treatment. This combined approach leverages the strengths of both medical systems, with TCM providing complementary support in symptom management and immune modulation [2]. Furthermore, the genetic and pathogenic similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have provided a rationale for applying TCM's historical experience with SARS to the current pandemic, reinforcing the continuity of its application in infectious disease control [1].\n\nWhile TCM is recognized for its anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunoregulatory properties, the evidence supporting its efficacy in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections is still evolving. Several meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials have highlighted the potential benefits of TCM in improving clinical outcomes, though methodological limitations and variability in study designs necessitate further rigorous investigation [7]. Overall, the growing body of research underscores the need for a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to evaluating the role of TCM in the therapeutic management of SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

      "content": "The introduction sections of the reviewed papers collectively highlight the growing interest in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as a therapeutic approach for SARS-CoV-2 infections, yet they also reveal significant gaps in the theoretical and historical depth of TCM's role in infectious disease management. While several papers provide a general overview of TCM's relevance to viral infections, such as the integration of TCM into national treatment protocols during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [4,5], none of them offer a comprehensive explanation of TCM's foundational theories or diagnostic principles that could directly inform its application against SARS-CoV-2. This omission is particularly notable in papers that emphasize the clinical utility of TCM but fail to situate it within the broader framework of TCM philosophy and practice [1,3].\n\nMoreover, the lack of historical context is a recurring limitation. Although some papers mention TCM's historical role in managing infectious diseases, such as SARS and H1N1, they do not provide detailed case studies or specific examples of how TCM was applied in prior outbreaks, which would have strengthened their argument for its relevance to the current pandemic [2,5]. This gap limits the ability to draw meaningful parallels between past and present applications of TCM, thereby reducing the analytical depth of the introductions.\n\nAdditionally, the papers vary in their engagement with the scientific validation of TCM. While some acknowledge the need for more rigorous scientific evaluation to establish TCM's efficacy and safety [4,7], none provide a systematic comparison between TCM and Western medical approaches in the context of SARS-CoV-2 treatment. This absence of comparative analysis hinders the development of a nuanced understanding of TCM's potential contributions to pandemic response.\n\nFinally, the conceptual framework of TCM is often underdeveloped in the introductions. While some papers briefly mention TCM's holistic approach to health and disease, they do not delve into the philosophical or cultural underpinnings that shape its diagnostic and therapeutic strategies [1,6]. This omission limits the reader's ability to appreciate the unique perspectives that TCM offers in the context of modern virology and public health.\n\nIn summary, while the introductions of the reviewed papers lay a necessary foundation for understanding TCM's role in SARS-CoV-2 treatment, they often lack the depth, historical context, and theoretical clarity needed to fully support the claims made about TCM's efficacy and relevance. Future research should aim to address these gaps by integrating more comprehensive discussions of TCM's theoretical and historical foundations, as well as by providing rigorous scientific validation and comparative analyses with Western medical paradigms.",

      "content": "The clinical applications and efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections represent a complex and evolving area of research. TCM has been widely integrated into the therapeutic management of the disease, particularly in China, where it has been used in conjunction with conventional medical treatments. This integration includes the use of herbal formulations, such as Lianhua Qingwen, Jianhua Qinggan Granule, and Xuebijing Injection, which have been approved for clinical use and are believed to exert antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects [2,4]. These formulations are thought to target key molecular pathways, such as Mpro (SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase) and ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), which are critical for viral entry and replication [7].\n\nWhile some clinical studies and meta-analyses suggest that TCM may improve certain outcomes, such as symptom resolution and test conversion rates, the overall evidence base remains heterogeneous and often lacks the methodological rigor required for definitive conclusions. A meta-analysis of 22 randomized clinical trials reported a significant improvement in test conversion rates (RR = 1.21; 95% CI; _p_ < 0.0001; I² = 84%) and reduced symptom duration, but it also highlighted the variability in study designs, populations, and outcome measures, which may affect the reliability of the findings [7]. Furthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has acknowledged the potential benefits of early TCM intervention but has emphasized the need for more large-scale, well-controlled trials to establish robust evidence for its efficacy [4].\n\nThe application of non-herbal TCM modalities, such as acupuncture, moxibustion, and cupping, remains underexplored in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The available literature provides limited empirical evidence, standardized protocols, or detailed clinical outcomes regarding their use. Most studies that mention these modalities do not specify the particular techniques, treatment durations, or measurable effects associated with their application, and the mechanisms by which they may influence physiological processes such as immune response or inflammation remain unclear [3,5]. This lack of rigorous research and standardized frameworks significantly limits the ability to assess the true efficacy of these interventions.\n\nIn addition to methodological challenges, the complexity of TCM formulations and the difficulty in standardizing treatment protocols present further barriers to evaluating their efficacy using modern research frameworks. The holistic and individualized nature of TCM complicates the application of Western-style clinical trial designs, which are typically based on standardized interventions and controlled environments [6]. Moreover, the absence of detailed pharmacological and mechanistic data, including pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations, hinders the ability to fully understand the safety and efficacy of TCM treatments [4,5].\n\nDespite these challenges, the integration of TCM into the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections continues to attract attention, particularly in regions where it is an established part of the healthcare system. However, the current evidence base is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy and safety of TCM in this context. Future research should prioritize the development of standardized protocols, the conduct of large-scale randomized controlled trials, and the exploration of mechanistic pathways to provide a more rigorous and comprehensive understanding of TCM's role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections [1,7].",

      "content": "The application of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections has been widely explored, with a focus on both clinical practice and research methodologies. TCM is typically employed in conjunction with conventional therapies, incorporating modalities such as herbal medicine, acupuncture, and injectable formulations, particularly for severe cases where bioavailability and purity of ingredients are critical factors [3,4]. The historical use of TCM in managing the SARS outbreak in 2002–2003 has informed its current application in treating SARS-CoV-2, although the extent of its efficacy remains a subject of ongoing investigation [1,4].\n\nSeveral studies have examined the clinical outcomes associated with TCM interventions. A meta-analysis of 22 randomized clinical trials found that TCM significantly improved several key outcomes, including the conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 tests (RR = 1.21; 95% CI; _p_ < 0.0001; I² = 84%) and reduced symptom duration, such as fever, cough, and fatigue [7]. These findings suggest that TCM may play a supportive role in accelerating recovery and improving patient outcomes, particularly in mild-to-moderate cases. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has acknowledged the potential benefits of early TCM intervention but has also emphasized the need for more large-scale randomized controlled trials to establish robust evidence for its efficacy [4].\n\nDespite the promising results from some studies, the overall body of evidence remains heterogeneous. Many clinical studies on TCM for SARS-CoV-2 have been registered but not fully conducted due to the effective containment of the virus in China, limiting the availability of comprehensive data [5]. Additionally, some papers lack specific clinical trial data or detailed case studies, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy of TCM in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections [1,4].\n\nThe theoretical and methodological challenges in evaluating TCM using modern research frameworks have also been highlighted. These include the complexity of TCM formulations, the difficulty in standardizing treatment protocols, and the challenges of applying Western-style clinical trial designs to a system of medicine that is inherently holistic and individualized [6].\n\nIn summary, while TCM has been widely used in the clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the evidence supporting its efficacy remains mixed. Some studies suggest potential benefits in symptom relief, recovery time, and reduction of severe outcomes, particularly when used in combination with conventional treatments. However, the lack of large-scale, well-controlled trials and the methodological challenges in evaluating TCM limit the strength of the current evidence. Future research should focus on addressing these gaps to provide a more rigorous and comprehensive understanding of TCM's role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

      "content": "The current body of literature on the application of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections reveals a mixed landscape of clinical evidence, methodological strengths, and critical limitations. While several studies highlight the potential of TCM in both prevention and treatment, the overall quality and rigor of the evidence remain inconsistent across the reviewed literature.\n\nSeveral papers emphasize the integration of TCM into standard treatment protocols in China, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, the paper titled *The Emerging Role of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Therapeutic Management of COVID-19* notes the increasing use of TCM in clinical settings, with formulations such as Lianhua Qingwen Keli, Jinhua Qinggan Keli, and Xuebijing Injection being approved for additional indications related to SARS-CoV-2 [4]. However, the evidence supporting these applications is predominantly observational, and the mechanisms of action and long-term efficacy of these formulations remain under investigation [2].\n\nA meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials on the effect of TCM in treating COVID-19 provides a more structured clinical application section, but it lacks a detailed discussion of the heterogeneity among the included studies. This omission raises concerns about the reliability of the meta-analytic results, as variability in study design, population, and outcome measures can significantly influence the conclusions [7]. Furthermore, the paper does not address potential publication bias or the methodological quality of the individual trials, which are critical factors in evaluating the validity of meta-analytic findings.\n\nOther reviews and perspectives on TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections highlight the lack of empirical evidence to substantiate the efficacy of specific TCM interventions. While some studies mention the use of TCM for both specific and non-specific prevention, such as enhancing immunity and promoting self-healing, they fail to provide quantitative results or statistical analyses to support these claims [3,5]. This absence of robust data limits the depth of clinical analysis and undermines the ability to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of TCM in SARS-CoV-2 management.\n\nMoreover, several papers acknowledge the need for more rigorous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to validate the efficacy of TCM treatments. The paper *Traditional Chinese Medicine in Treating SARS-CoV-2 Infections* explicitly states that the clinical data are primarily based on observational studies and case series, which may limit the generalizability of the findings [3]. Similarly, *Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Treatment of Patients Infected with 2019 New Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): A Review and Perspective* emphasizes the high usage rate of TCM in China but does not critically evaluate the methodological rigor of the studies supporting this usage, nor does it address the lack of standardized protocols or peer-reviewed clinical trials [1].\n\nIn summary, while TCM has been widely used in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly in China, the current evidence base is largely observational and lacks the methodological rigor required to establish definitive efficacy. The reviewed literature consistently calls for more high-quality clinical trials, standardized protocols, and critical evaluation of TCM's role in modern medical practice. Until such studies are conducted, the full potential and limitations of TCM in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections remain to be fully understood.",

A variety of TCM formulations, including Lianhua Qingwen, Jianhua Qinggan Granule, and Xuebijing Injection, have been employed in clinical practice to address multiple aspects of the disease, such as viral replication, immune modulation, and inflammatory responses [2,4]. These formulations, often composed of multiple herbal ingredients, are believed to exert synergistic effects, targeting key molecular pathways such as Mpro (SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase) and ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), which are critical in viral entry and replication [7].\n\nSeveral studies have documented the clinical application of TCM in different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with some formulations, such as Qing Fei Pai Du Tang and Lian Hua Qing Wen, being officially approved by the National Medical Products Administration for use in clinical settings [2]. These formulations have shown potential in improving clinical outcomes, particularly in mild to moderate cases, and have been incorporated into national guidelines for such scenarios [3,5]. However, the specific herbs or active compounds within these formulations are often not fully detailed, and the mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood.\n\nNetwork pharmacology has emerged as a promising approach to elucidate the molecular interactions of TCM formulations, identifying potential targets and pathways involved in their therapeutic effects, particularly in the context of immune and coagulation systems [6]. Nevertheless, the literature frequently lacks detailed pharmacological and mechanistic data, including pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations, which are essential for assessing the safety and efficacy of these treatments [4,5].\n\nMoreover, the standardization and quality control of herbal medicines remain significant challenges, affecting the reproducibility and generalizability of study findings. While some studies suggest that TCM may offer complementary benefits when integrated with conventional medical treatments, the evidence base is still insufficient to draw definitive conclusions about its efficacy and safety.

While several papers highlight the potential of herbal formulations in managing both mild and severe cases of COVID-19, they often lack detailed pharmacological or mechanistic insights into how these treatments interact with the virus or the human immune system [2,3,4]. For instance, one study notes the use of injectable herbal formulations in critical stages of the disease, suggesting a possible role in supportive care, but it also emphasizes the absence of standardized dosing and long-term safety data, which are essential for clinical adoption [4].\n\nMoreover, several reviews and meta-analyses point out the lack of specificity in the descriptions of herbal ingredients, dosages, and clinical outcomes. A review paper, for example, acknowledges the potential of herbal medicine in combating SARS-CoV-2 but criticizes the lack of empirical data and standardized protocols, which hinders the ability to assess the true efficacy and safety of these treatments [1]. Similarly, a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials highlights the potential of TCM to target key viral components but falls short in providing a detailed discussion of specific herbal formulations or their mechanisms of action, thus limiting the translational value of the findings [7].\n\nThe absence of detailed pharmacological data on active compounds, mechanisms of action, and potential side effects is a recurring concern across multiple studies. This gap is particularly evident in the lack of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations of herbal treatments, which are critical for understanding how these formulations behave in the body and their long-term implications [4,5]. Additionally, the lack of standardization and quality control of herbal medicines remains a major challenge, as it complicates the reproducibility and generalizability of the results [5].\n\nDespite these limitations, some studies suggest that certain TCM formulations have shown potential in improving clinical outcomes, particularly in the context of integrated treatment approaches combining TCM with conventional medicine.

Despite their inclusion in several TCM treatment frameworks, the current literature provides limited empirical evidence, standardized protocols, or detailed clinical outcomes regarding their application in this context. The reviewed studies consistently highlight a lack of rigorous research, with most findings based on observational reports or anecdotal accounts rather than controlled trials. For instance, while some papers mention the use of acupuncture, moxibustion, and cupping in SARS-CoV-2 patients, they do not specify the particular acupuncture points, treatment durations, or measurable clinical effects associated with these interventions [3,5].\n\nAdditionally, the absence of detailed mechanistic insights into how these modalities may influence physiological processes such as immune response, inflammation, or circulation remains a critical gap in the literature.

A central issue is the lack of standardized protocols for TCM treatments, which leads to significant variability in herbal formulations, treatment regimens, and clinical outcomes, thereby complicating the replication and generalizability of research findings [3,4,5]. This variability not only undermines the reliability of clinical trials but also challenges the development of evidence-based guidelines for TCM use in SARS-CoV-2 management.\n\nMoreover, the holistic and individualized nature of TCM presents additional difficulties in isolating the specific effects of interventions, especially when they are combined with conventional medical treatments. The interplay between TCM and Western medicine complicates the assessment of efficacy and safety, as the combined effects may not be fully predictable or quantifiable [1,6]. This complexity raises concerns about the validity of outcome measures and the ability to draw clear causal inferences from clinical studies.\n\nAnother significant limitation is the scarcity of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that meet modern scientific standards. Many studies on TCM for SARS-CoV-2 are observational or based on small sample sizes, which limits the statistical power and external validity of the findings [5,7]. The limited geographic representation of study populations further restricts the applicability of results to diverse patient groups. Additionally, the difficulty in blinding participants and researchers in TCM trials, due to the personalized nature of prescriptions and the close patient-practitioner relationship, poses a major methodological challenge [3].\n\nThe translation of traditional knowledge into modern scientific frameworks remains a persistent obstacle, as the mechanisms of action of many TCM formulations are not well understood, and long-term safety profiles require further investigation [4,6]. This gap between traditional practice and empirical validation underscores the need for interdisciplinary research that bridges the divide between TCM and contemporary biomedical science.\n\nFinally, ethical and practical challenges in conducting placebo-controlled trials for TCM treatments have been widely discussed, as the holistic and individualized nature of TCM may make the use of placebos ethically questionable in certain contexts [2,3].

Similarly, another review underscores the importance of improving the quality and quantity of clinical trials involving TCM, particularly in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and stresses the need for more rigorous scientific validation of TCM treatments [5].\n\nIn addition to clinical validation, the development of standardized protocols for TCM interventions is a recurring theme across several studies. A paper examining the integration of TCM and Western medicine in China notes that standardization of TCM formulations is crucial for ensuring consistency and reproducibility in clinical outcomes [2]. This sentiment is echoed in other reviews, which call for the establishment of standardized treatment protocols to enhance the credibility and applicability of TCM in modern healthcare systems [3,4].\n\nMoreover, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of TCM treatments remain poorly understood. Several papers highlight the urgent need for research into the biochemical and pharmacological pathways through which TCM formulations exert their therapeutic effects. For example, one study suggests that exploring the molecular mechanisms of TCM treatments is essential for bridging the gap between traditional knowledge and modern scientific understanding [4]. Another paper further emphasizes the importance of identifying novel compounds with anti-coronaviral activity through systematic investigation of TCM components [1].\n\nIn addition to mechanistic studies, the long-term safety and pharmacokinetics of TCM formulations require further exploration. A review specifically calls for more research on the safety profiles of TCM treatments, particularly for injectable formulations used in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection [4]. This concern is echoed in other studies that advocate for comprehensive safety assessments to ensure the viability of TCM as a complementary or alternative therapeutic option.\n\nInterdisciplinary collaboration is another key recommendation across multiple studies. The integration of TCM with Western medicine, as well as the application of advanced methodologies such as network pharmacology, systems biology, and big data analysis, is seen as a promising approach to unravel the complex interactions of TCM treatments with SARS-CoV-2 [6]. Such collaborative efforts are expected to enhance the scientific rigor and translational potential of TCM research.\n\nIn summary, while TCM has shown potential in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the current evidence base is limited by methodological inconsistencies, lack of standardization, and insufficient mechanistic understanding. Future research must address these challenges through large-scale randomized controlled trials, standardized protocols, and interdisciplinary approaches to fully realize the therapeutic potential of TCM in the context of the ongoing pandemic.",

      "content": "A recurring theme across multiple papers is the recognition of the need for more rigorous and specific future research directions in the application of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections. While several studies acknowledge the importance of standardization, mechanistic studies, and scientific validation, they often fall short in providing concrete methodologies or actionable steps to achieve these goals. For instance, the paper titled *combating_covid_19_with_integrated_traditional_chinese_and_western_medicine_in_china* outlines key areas for improvement such as standardization and mechanistic research but fails to elaborate on how these can be implemented [2]. Similarly, *state_of_the_art_evidence_of_traditional_chinese_medicine_for_treating_coronavirus_disease_2019* highlights the necessity of more rigorous research but does not propose specific strategies or experimental designs to advance this agenda [5].\n\nIn contrast, *traditional_chinese_medicine_in_treating_sars_cov_2_infections* offers more practical future directions, such as the use of multi-omics approaches and AI-driven drug discovery, yet it still lacks detailed recommendations for research design [3]. The paper *the_emerging_role_of_traditional_chinese_medicine_in_the_therapeutic_management_of_covid_19* emphasizes the importance of international collaboration to establish common research standards and regulatory frameworks, suggesting that such efforts are essential for the global integration of TCM into healthcare systems [4]. This perspective is echoed in *traditional_chinese_medicine_in_the_treatment_of_patients_infected_with_2019_new_coronavirus_sars_cov_2_a_review_and_perspective*, which calls for interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of standardized protocols for mechanistic studies, although it does not provide specific research proposals [1].\n\nNotably, *the_challenges_and_opportunities_of_traditional_chinese_medicines_against_covid_19_a_way_out_from_a_network_perspective* presents a more forward-looking and methodologically specific approach, advocating for the use of multi-omics and network-based modeling to explore TCM’s therapeutic potential and for translational research to bridge traditional knowledge with modern scientific frameworks [6]. This paper stands out for its detailed suggestions, which could serve as a blueprint for future studies.\n\nFinally, *effect_of_traditional_chinese_medicine_on_covid_19_treatment_a_meta_analysis_of_randomized_clinical_trials* concludes with a brief future directions section that lacks the depth and specificity required to guide subsequent research. The paper could have benefited from a more detailed discussion on areas such as the development of standardized TCM protocols, the application of advanced pharmacological techniques, and the exploration of TCM’s role in long-term recovery from SARS-CoV-2 [7].\n\nOverall, while the reviewed literature consistently emphasizes the importance of scientific validation, standardization, and interdisciplinary collaboration, the lack of concrete methodologies and actionable steps remains a significant gap. Future research should focus on addressing these limitations by proposing specific experimental designs, leveraging advanced technologies, and fostering international cooperation to ensure the robust and systematic development of TCM in the context of SARS-CoV-2 treatment.",
