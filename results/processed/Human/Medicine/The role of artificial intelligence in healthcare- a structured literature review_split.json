Few previous studies have investigated this topic from a multi-disciplinary perspective, including accounting, business and management, decision sciences and health professions.\n\nMethods: The structured literature review with its reliable and replicable research protocol allowed the researchers to extract 288 peer-reviewed papers from Scopus. The authors used qualitative and quantitative variables to analyse authors, journals, keywords, and collaboration networks among researchers. Additionally, the paper benefted from the Bibliometrix R software package.\n\nResults: The investigation showed that the literature in this feld is emerging. It focuses on health services management, predictive medicine, patient data and diagnostics, and clinical decision-making. The United States, China, and the United Kingdom contributed the highest number of studies. Keyword analysis revealed that AI can support physicians in making a diagnosis, predicting the spread of diseases and customising treatment paths.\n\nConclusions: The literature reveals several AI applications for health services and a stream of research that has not fully been covered. For instance, AI projects require skills and data quality awareness for data-intensive analysis and knowledge-based management. Insights can help researchers and health professionals understand and address future research on AI in the healthcare feld.\n\nKeywords: Artifcial intelligence, Healthcare, Patient data, Clinical decision-making, Management",

      "content": "Artifcial intelligence (AI) generally applies to computational technologies that emulate mechanisms assisted by human intelligence, such as thought, deep learning, adaptation, engagement, and sensory understanding [1, 2]. Some devices can execute a role that typically involves human interpretation and decision-making [3, 4]. Tese techniques have an interdisciplinary approach and can be applied to diferent felds, such as medicine and health. AI has been involved in medicine since as early as the 1950s, when physicians made the frst attempts to improve their diagnoses using computer-aided programs [5, 6]. Interest and advances in medical AI applications have surged in recent years due to the substantially enhanced computing power of modern computers and the vast amount of digital data available for collection and utilisation [7]. AI is gradually changing medical practice. Tere are several AI applications in medicine that can be used in a variety of medical felds, such as clinical, diagnostic, rehabilitative, surgical, and predictive practices. Another critical area of medicine where AI is making an impact is clinical decision-making and disease diagnosis. AI technologies can ingest, analyse, and report large volumes of data across diferent modalities to detect disease and guide clinical decisions [3, 8]. AI applications can deal with the vast amount of data produced in medicine and fnd new information that would otherwise remain hidden in the mass of medical big data [9–11]. Tese technologies can also identify new drugs for health services management and patient care treatments [5, 6].\n\nCourage in the application of AI is visible through a search in the primary research databases. However, as Meskò et  al. [7] fnd, the technology will potentially reduce care costs and repetitive operations by focusing the medical profession on critical thinking and clinical creativity. As Cho et  al. and Doyle et  al. [8, 9] add, the AI perspective is exciting; however, new studies will be needed to establish the efcacy and applications of AI in the medical feld [10].\n\nOur paper will also concentrate on AI strategies for healthcare from the accounting, business, and management perspectives. Te authors used the structured literature review (SLR) method for its reliable and replicable research protocol [11] and selected bibliometric variables as sources of investigation. Bibliometric usage enables the recognition of the main quantitative variables of the study stream [12]. Tis method facilitates the detection of the required details of a particular research subject, including feld authors, number of publications, keywords for interaction between variables (policies, properties and governance) and country data [13]. It also allows the application of the science mapping technique [14]. Our paper adopted the Bibliometrix R package and the biblioshiny web interface as tools of analysis [14].\n\nTe investigation ofers the following insights for future researchers and practitioners:\n\n(a) bibliometric information on 288 peer-reviewed English papers from the Scopus collection.\n(b) Identifcation of leading journals in this feld, such as Journal of Medical Systems, Studies in Health Technology and Informatics, IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, and Decision Support Systems.\n(c) Qualitative and quantitative information on authors’ Lotka’s law, h-index, g-index, m-index, keyword, and citation data.\n(d) Research on specifc countries to assess AI in the delivery and efectiveness of healthcare, quotes, and networks within each region.\n(e) A topic dendrogram study that identifes fve research clusters: health services management, predictive medicine, patient data, diagnostics, and fnally, clinical decision-making.\n(f ) An in-depth discussion that develops theoretical and practical implications for future studies.\n\nTe paper is organised as follows. Section  2 lists the main bibliometric articles in this feld. Section  3 elaborates on the methodology. Section 4 presents the fndings of the bibliometric analysis. Section 5 discusses the main elements of AI in healthcare based on the study results. Section  6 concludes the article with future implications for research.",

For this reason, bibliometric methods are attracting increasing interest among researchers as a reliable and impersonal research analytical approach [16, 17]. Recently, bibliometrics has been an essential method for analysing and predicting research trends [18]. Table  1 lists other research that has used a similar approach in the research stream investigated.\n\nTe scientifc articles reported show substantial differences in keywords and research topics that have been previously studied. Te bibliometric analysis of Huang et al. [19] describes rehabilitative medicine using virtual reality technology. According to the authors, the primary goal of rehabilitation is to enhance and restore functional ability and quality of life for patients with physical impairments or disabilities. In recent years, many healthcare disciplines have been privileged to access various technologies that provide tools for both research and clinical intervention.\n\nTable 1 List of research using bibliometric analysis.

[20] focus on text mining in medical research. As reported, text mining reveals new, previously unknown information by using a computer to automatically extract information from diferent text resources. Text mining methods can be regarded as an extension of data mining to text data. Text mining is playing an increasingly signifcant role in processing medical information. Similarly, the studies by dos Santos et  al. [21] focus on applying data mining and machine learning (ML) techniques to public health problems. As stated in this research, public health may be defned as the art and science of preventing diseases, promoting health, and prolonging life. Using data mining and ML techniques, it is possible to discover new information that otherwise would be hidden. Tese two studies are related to another topic: medical big data. According to Liao et al. [22], big data is a typical “buzzword” in the business and research community, referring to a great mass of digital data collected from various sources. In the medical feld, we can obtain a vast amount of data (i.e., medical big data). Data mining and ML techniques can help deal with this information and provide helpful insights for physicians and patients. More recently, Choudhury et al. [23] provide a systematic review on the use of ML to improve the care of elderly patients, demonstrating eligible studies primarily in psychological disorders and eye diseases.\n\nTran et  al. [2] focus on the global evolution of AI research in medicine. Teir bibliometric analysis highlights trends and topics related to AI applications and techniques. As stated in Connelly et  al.’s [24] study, robot-assisted surgeries have rapidly increased in recent years. Teir bibliometric analysis demonstrates how robotic-assisted surgery has gained acceptance in different medical felds, such as urological, colorectal, cardiothoracic, orthopaedic, maxillofacial and neurosurgery applications. Additionally, the bibliometric analysis of Guo et al. [25] provides an in-depth study of AI publications through December 2019. Te paper focuses on tangible AI health applications, giving researchers an idea of how algorithms can help doctors and nurses. A new stream of research related to AI is also emerging. In this sense, Choudhury and Asan’s [26] scientifc contribution provides a systematic review of the AI literature to identify health risks for patients. Tey report on 53 studies involving technology for clinical alerts, clinical reports, and drug safety. Considering the considerable interest within this research stream, this analysis difers from the current literature for several reasons. It aims to provide in-depth discussion, considering mainly the business, management, and accounting felds and not dealing only with medical and health profession publications.\n\nAdditionally, our analysis aims to provide a bibliometric analysis of variables such as authors, countries, citations and keywords to guide future research perspectives for researchers and practitioners, as similar analyses have done for several publications in other research streams [15, 16, 27]. In doing so, we use a diferent database, Scopus, that is typically adopted in social sciences felds. Finally, our analysis will propose and discuss a dominant framework of variables in this feld, and our analysis will not be limited to AI application descriptions.",

      "content": "Tis paper evaluated AI in healthcare research streams using the SLR method [11]. As suggested by Massaro et al. [11], an SLR enables the study of the scientifc corpus of a research feld, including the scientifc rigour, reliability and replicability of operations carried out by researchers. As suggested by many scholars, the methodology allows qualitative and quantitative variables to highlight the best authors, journals and keywords and combine a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis [27–30]. Despite its widespread use in business and management [16, 31], the SLR is also used in the health sector based on the same philosophy through which it was originally conceived [32, 33]. A methodological analysis of previously published articles reveals that the most frequently used steps are as follows [28, 31, 34]:\n\n1. defning research questions;\n2. writing the research protocol;\n3. defning the research sample to be analysed;\n4. developing codes for analysis; and\n5. critically analysing, discussing, and identifying a\nfuture research agenda.\n\nConsidering the above premises, the authors believe that an SLR is the best method because it combines scientifc validity, replicability of the research protocol and connection between multiple inputs.\n\nAs stated by the methodological paper, the frst step is research question identifcation. For this purpose, we beneft from the analysis of Zupic and Čater [15], who provide several research questions for future researchers to link the study of authors, journals, keywords and citations. Terefore, RQ1 is “What are the most prominent authors, journal keywords and citations in the feld of the research study?” Additionally, as suggested by Haleem et al. [35], new technologies, including AI, are changing the medical feld in unexpected timeframes, requiring studies in multiple areas. Terefore, RQ2 is “How does artifcial intelligence relate to healthcare, and what is the focus of the literature?” Ten, as discussed by Massaro et al. [36], RQ3 is “What are the research applications of artifcial intelligence for healthcare?”.\n\nTe frst research question aims to defne the qualitative and quantitative variables of the knowledge fow under investigation. Te second research question seeks to determine the state of the art and applications of AI in healthcare. Finally, the third research question aims to help researchers identify practical and theoretical implications and future research ideas in this feld.\n\nTe second fundamental step of the SLR is writing the research protocol [11]. Table  2 indicates the currently known literature elements, uniquely identifying the research focus, motivations and research strategy adopted and the results providing a link with the following points. Additionally, to strengthen the analysis, our investigation benefts from the PRISMA statement methodological article [37]. Although the SLR is a validated method for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, we believe that the workfow provided may beneft the replicability of the results [37–40]. Figure 1 summarises the researchers’ research steps, indicating that there are no results that can be referred to as a meta-analysis.\n\nTe third step is to specify the search strategy and search database. Our analysis is based on the search string “Artifcial Intelligence” OR “AI” AND “Healthcare” with a focus on “Business, Management, and Accounting”, “Decision Sciences”, and “Health professions”. As suggested by [11, 41] and motivated by [42], keywords can be selected through a top-down approach by identifying a large search feld and then focusing on particular sub-topics. Te paper uses data retrieved from the Scopus database, a multi-disciplinary database, which allowed the researchers to identify critical articles for scientifc analysis [43]. Additionally, Scopus was selected based on Guo et al.’s [25] limitations, which suggest that “future studies will apply other databases, such as Scopus, to explore more potential papers”. Te research focuses on articles and reviews published in peer-reviewed journals for their scientifc relevance [11, 16, 17, 29] and does not include the grey literature, conference proceedings or books/book chapters. Articles written in any language other than English were excluded [2]. For transparency and replicability, the analysis was conducted on 11 January 2021. Using this research strategy, the authors retrieved 288 articles. To strengthen the study’s reliability, we publicly provide the full bibliometric extract on the Zenodo repository [44, 45].\n\nTe fourth research phase is defning the code framework that initiates the analysis of the variables. Te study will identify the following:\n\n(1) descriptive information of the research area;\n(2) source analysis [16];\n(3) author and citation analysis [28];\n(4) keywords and network analysis [14]; and (5) geographic distribution of the papers [14].\n\nTe fnal research phase is the article’s discussion and conclusion, where implications and future research trends will be identifed.\n\nAt the research team level, the information is analysed with the statistical software R-Studio and the Bibliometrix package [15], which allows scientifc analysis of the results obtained through the multi-disciplinary database.",

Source: Authors’ elaboration\n\nTerefore, the analysis of the journals revealed that we are dealing with an interdisciplinary research feld. Tis conclusion is confrmed, for example, by the presence of purely medical journals, journals dedicated to the technological growth of healthcare, and journals with a longterm perspective such as futures.\n\nTe distribution frequency of the articles (Fig. 3) indicates the journals dealing with the topic and related issues. Between 2008 and 2012, a signifcant growth in the number of publications on the subject is noticeable. However, the graph shows the results of the Loess regression, which includes the quantity and publication time of the journal under analysis as variables. Tis method allows the function to assume an unlimited distribution; that is, feature can consider values below zero if the data are close to zero. It contributes to a better visual result and highlights the discontinuity in the publication periods [47].\n\nTable 4 Main twenty sources.

As indicated in the literature [48, 49], using factor analysis to discover the most cited papers allows for a better understanding of the scientifc world’s intellectual structure. For example, our research makes it possible to consider certain publications that efectively analyse subject specialisation. For instance, Santosh’s [50] article addresses the new paradigm of AI with ML algorithms for data analysis and decision support in the COVID-19 period, setting a benchmark in terms of citations by researchers.\n\nMoving on to the application, an article by Shickel et al. [51] begins with the belief that the healthcare world currently has much health and administrative data. In this context, AI and deep learning will support medical and administrative staf in extracting data, predicting outcomes, and learning medical representations. Finally, in the same line of research, Baig et al. [52], with a focus on wearable patient monitoring systems (WPMs), conclude that AI and deep learning may be landmarks for continuous patient monitoring and support for healthcare delivery.",

Hence, in the next section, we measure the contributory power of each author by investigating the DF ranking through the number of elements.\n\nfelds where the frst author is entered by surname alphabetical order [55].\n\nTe mathematical equation for the DF is shown as:\n\n$$\nD F = { \\frac { N m f } { N m t } }\n$$\n\nTe dominance factor (DF) is a ratio measuring the fraction of multi-authored articles in which an author acts as the frst author [53]. Several bibliometric studies use the DF in their analyses [46, 54]. Te DF ranking calculates an author’s dominance in producing articles. Te DF is calculated by dividing the number of an author’s multiauthored papers as the frst author (Nmf ) by the author’s total number of multi-authored papers (Nmt). Tis is omitted in the single-author case due to the constant value of 1 for single-authored articles. Tis formulation could lead to some distortions in the results, especially in",

Te ranking is based on the following elements: healthcare, artifcial intelligence, and clinical decision support system. Keyword analysis confrms the scientifc area of reference. In particular, we deduce the defnition as “Artifcial intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages” [2, 63]. Panch et al. [4] fnd that these technologies can be used in diferent business and management areas.

According to our specifc interest, if we applied AI in healthcare, we would achieve technological applications to help and support doctors and medical researchers in decisionmaking. Te link between AI and decision-making is the reason why we fnd, in the seventh position, the keyword clinical decision support system. AI techniques can unlock clinically relevant information hidden in the massive amount of data that can assist clinical decision-making [64]. If we analyse the following keywords, we fnd other elements related to decision-making and support systems.\n\nTe TreeMap below (Fig. 6) highlights the combination of possible keywords representing AI and healthcare.\n\nTe topic dendrogram in Fig.  7 represents the hierarchical order and the relationship between the keywords generated by hierarchical clustering [42]. Te cut in the fgure and the vertical lines facilitate an investigation and interpretation of the diferent clusters. As stated by Andrews [48], the fgure is not intended to fnd the perfect level of associations between clusters. However, it aims to estimate the approximate number of clusters to facilitate further discussion.\n\nTe research stream of AI in healthcare is divided into two main strands. Te blue strand focuses on medical information systems and the internet. Some papers are related to healthcare organisations, such as the Internet of Tings, meaning that healthcare organisations use AI to support health services management and data analysis. AI applications are also used to improve diagnostic and therapeutic accuracy and the overall clinical treatment process [2]. If we consider the second block, the red one, three diferent clusters highlight separate aspects of the topic. Te frst could be explained as AI and ML predictive algorithms. Trough AI applications, it is possible to obtain a predictive approach that can ensure that patients are better monitored. Tis also allows a better understanding of risk perception for doctors and medical researchers. In the second cluster, the most frequent words are decisions, information system, and support system. Tis means that AI applications can support doctors and medical researchers in decision-making. Information coming from AI technologies can be used to consider difcult problems and support a more straightforward and rapid decisionmaking process. In the third cluster, it is vital to highlight that the ML model can deal with vast amounts of data. From those inputs, it can return outcomes that can optimise the work of healthcare organisations and scheduling of medical activities.\n\nFurthermore, the word cloud in Fig.  8 highlights aspects of AI in healthcare, such as decision support systems, decision-making, health services management, learning systems, ML techniques and diseases. Te fgure depicts how AI is linked to healthcare and how it is used in medicine.\n\nFigure 9 represents the search trends based on the keywords analysed. Te research started in 2012. First, it identifed research topics related to clinical decision support systems. Tis topic was recurrent during the following years. Interestingly, in 2018, studies investigated AI and natural language processes as possible tools to manage patients and administrative elements. Finally, a new research stream considers AI’s role in fghting COVID-19 [65, 66].\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">artificialintelligence</td><td rowspan=\"2\">healthcare</td><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td>supperisiustem</td><td>covid-19</td><td>dasariptive</td><td>intenet</td><td>inmedials</td><td>mhealth</td><td>prescrpgtive</td></tr><tr><td>natural language processing</td><td>predictive</td><td>artificial clinical depsion</td><td></td><td></td><td>ontology</td><td>textmining</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td>data analytics</td><td>telemedicine</td><td>systems electronic health</td><td>velocity veracity</td><td></td><td></td><td>comuii-thlt</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>deep learning datamining</td><td>decisionsupurt</td><td>ai</td><td>records intoeaties</td><td>volume</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>machine learning</td><td colspan=\"2\">big data</td><td>classification</td><td>cliniel deisienn</td><td>image</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n[Image]\nFig. 7 Topic dendrogram.

With its sophisticated algorithms and several applications, AI has assisted doctors and medical professionals in the domains of health information systems, geocoding health data, epidemic and syndromic surveillance, predictive modelling and decision support, and medical imaging [2, 9, 10, 64].

Tese applications’ strength is becoming even more critical in the COVID-19 period, during which information exchange is continually needed to properly manage the pandemic worldwide [71]. Other applications involve coordinating information tools for patients and enabling appropriate inferences for health risk alerts and health outcome prediction [72]. AI applications allow, for example, hospitals and all health services to work more efciently for the following reasons:\n\n• Clinicians can access data immediately when they need it.\n+ Nurses can ensure better patient safety while administering medication.

[64], AI can help physicians make better clinical decisions or even replace human judgement in healthcare-specifc functional areas. According to Bennett and Hauser [80], algorithms can beneft clinical decisions by accelerating the process and the amount of care provided, positively impacting the cost of health services. Terefore, AI technologies can support medical professionals in their activities and simplify their jobs [4]. Finally, as Redondo and Sandoval [81] fnd, algorithmic platforms can provide virtual assistance to help doctors understand the semantics of language and learning to solve business process queries as a human being would.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 12 Dominant variables for AI in healthcare.

      "content": "Another challenging topic related to AI applications is patient data and diagnostics. AI techniques can help medical researchers deal with the vast amount of data from patients (i.e., medical big data). AI systems can manage data generated from clinical activities, such as screening, diagnosis, and treatment assignment. In this way, health personnel can learn similar subjects and associations between subject features and outcomes of interest [64].\n\nTese technologies can analyse raw data and provide helpful insights that can be used in patient treatments. Tey can help doctors in the diagnostic process; for example, to realise a high-speed body scan, it will be simpler to have an overall patient condition image. Ten, AI technology can recreate a 3D mapping solution of a patient’s body.\n\nIn terms of data, interesting research perspectives are emerging. For instance, we observed the emergence of a stream of research on patient data management and protection related to AI applications [82].\n\nFor diagnostics, AI techniques can make a diference in rehabilitation therapy and surgery. Numerous robots have been designed to support and manage such tasks. Rehabilitation robots physically support and guide, for example, a patient’s limb during motor therapy [83]. For surgery, AI has a vast opportunity to transform surgical robotics through devices that can perform semiautomated surgical tasks with increasing efciency. Te fnal aim of this technology is to automate procedures to negate human error while maintaining a high level of accuracy and precision [84]. Finally, the -19 period has led to increased remote patient diagnostics through telemedicine that enables remote observation of patients and provides physicians and nurses with support tools [66, 85, 86].",

Using the SLR method of Massaro et  al. [11], we provide a reliable and replicable research protocol for future studies in this feld. Additionally, we investigate the trend of scientifc publications on the subject, unexplored information, future directions, and implications using the science mapping workfow. Our analysis provides interesting insights.\n\nIn terms of bibliometric variables, the four leading journals, Journal of Medical Systems, Studies in Health Technology and Informatics, IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, and Decision Support Systems, are optimal locations for the publication of scientifc articles on this topic. Tese journals deal mainly with healthcare, medical information systems, and applications such as cloud computing, machine learning, and AI. Additionally, in terms of h-index, Bushko R.G. and Liu C. are the most productive and impactful authors in this research stream. Burke et  al.’s [67] contribution is the most cited with an analysis of nurse rostering using new technologies such as AI. Finally, in terms of keywords, co-occurrence reveals some interesting insights. For instance, researchers have found that AI has a role in diagnostic accuracy and helps in the analysis of health data by comparing thousands of medical records, experiencing automatic learning with clinical alerts, efcient management of health services and places of care, and the possibility of reconstructing patient history using these data.\n\nSecond, this paper fnds fve cluster analyses in healthcare applications: health services management, predictive medicine, patient data, diagnostics, and fnally, clinical decision-making. Tese technologies can also contribute to optimising logistics processes in health services and allowing a better allocation of resources.\n\nTird, the authors analysing the research fndings and the issues under discussion strongly support AI’s role in decision support. Tese applications, however, are demonstrated by creating a direct link to data quality management and the technology awareness of health personnel [87].",

      "content": "Several authors have analysed AI in the healthcare research stream, but in this case, the authors focus on other literature that includes business and decision-making processes. In this regard, the analysis of the search fow reveals a double view of the literature. On the one hand, some contributions belong to the positivist literature and embrace future applications and implications of technology for health service management, data analysis and diagnostics [6, 80, 88]. On the other hand, some investigations also aim to understand the darker sides of technology and its impact. For example, as Carter [89] states, the impact of AI is multi-sectoral; its development, however, calls for action to protect personal data. Similarly, Davenport and Kalakota [77] focus on the ethical implications of using AI in healthcare. According to the authors, intelligent machines raise issues of accountability, transparency, and permission, especially in automated communication with patients. Our analysis does not indicate a marked strand of the literature; therefore, we argue that the discussion of elements such as the transparency of technology for patients is essential for the development of AI applications.\n\nA large part of our results shows that, at the application level, AI can be used to improve medical support for patients (Fig.  11) [64, 82]. However, we believe that, as indicated by Kalis et  al. [90] on the pages of Harvard Business Review, the management of costly back-ofce problems should also be addressed.\n\nTe potential of algorithms includes data analysis. Tere is an immense quantity of data accessible now, which carries the possibility of providing information about a wide variety of medical and healthcare activities [91]. With the advent of modern computational methods, computer learning and AI techniques, there are numerous possibilities [79, 83, 84]. For example, AI makes it easier to turn data into concrete and actionable observations to improve decision-making, deliver high-quality patient treatment, adapt to real-time emergencies, and save more lives on the clinical front. In addition, AI makes it easier to leverage capital to develop systems and facilities and reduce expenses at the organisational level [78]. Studying contributions to the topic, we noticed that data accuracy was included in the debate, indicating that a high standard of data will beneft decision-making practitioners [38, 77]. AI techniques are an essential instrument for studying data and the extraction of medical insight, and they may assist medical researchers in their practices. Using computational tools, healthcare stakeholders may leverage the power of data not only to evaluate past data (descriptive analytics) but also to forecast potential outcomes (predictive analytics) and to defne the best actions for the present scenario (prescriptive analytics) [78]. Te current abundance of evidence makes it easier to provide a broad view of patient health; doctors should have access to the correct details at the right time and location to provide the proper treatment [92].",

Studies have shown that healthcare personnel are progressively being exposed to technology for diferent purposes, such as collecting patient records or diagnosis [71]. Tis is demonstrated by the keywords (Fig.  6) that focus on technology and the role of decision-making with new innovative tools. In addition, the discussion expands with Lu [93], which indicates that the excessive use of technology could hinder doctors’ skills and clinical procedures’ expansion. Among the main issues arising from the literature is the possible de-skilling of healthcare staf due to reduced autonomy in decision-making concerning patients [94]. Terefore, the challenges and discussion we uncovered in Fig. 11 are expanded by also considering the ethical implications of technology and the role of skills.",

Ten, the use of search terms such as \"Artifcial Intelligence\" OR \"AI\" AND \"Healthcare\" could be too general and exclude interesting studies. Moreover, although we analysed 288 peer-reviewed scientifc papers, because the new research topic is new, the analysis of conference papers could return interesting results for future researchers. Additionally, as this is a young research area, the analysis will be subject to recurrent obsolescence as multiple new research investigations are published.

If these technologies are essential for health services management and patient treatment, governments should invest and contribute to healthcare organisations’ modernisation. New investment funds could be made available in the healthcare world, as in the European case with the Next Generation EU programme or national investment programmes [95]. Additionally, this should happen especially in the poorest countries around the world, where there is a lack of infrastructure and services related to health and medicine [96].  On the other hand, it might be interesting to evaluate additional profts generated by healthcare organisations with AI technologies compared to those that do not use such technologies.\n\nFurther analysis could also identify why some parts of the world have not conducted studies in this area. It would be helpful to carry out a comparative analysis between countries active in this research feld and countries that are not currently involved. It would make it possible to identify variables afecting AI technologies’ presence or absence in healthcare organisations. Te results of collaboration between countries also present future researchers with the challenge of greater exchanges between researchers and professionals. Terefore, further research could investigate the diference in vision between professionals and academics.\n\nIn the accounting, business, and management research area, there is currently a lack of quantitative analysis of the costs and profts generated by healthcare organisations that use AI technologies. Terefore, research in this direction could further increase our understanding of the topic and the number of healthcare organisations that can access technologies based on AI.
