      "content": "Recently, we see a sharp increase in the number of multi-component positive psychology interventions (MPPIs). The aim of the current study is to examine the efcacy of MPPIs, through a systematic review and meta-analysis. We included 50 randomized controlled trials that were published in 51 articles between 1998 and August 2018. We found standardized mean diferences of Hedges’ $g { = } 0 . 3 4$ for subjective well-being, Hedges’ $g = 0 . 3 9$ for psychological well-being, indicating small to moderate efects, and Hedges’ $g = 0 . 2 9$ for depression, and Hedges’ $g = 0 . 3 5$ for anxiety and stress, indicating small efects. Removing outliers led to a considerable decrease in efect sizes for subjective well-being and depression, a slight decrease for psychological well-being, and a strong increase in the efect size for stress. Removing low quality studies led to a considerable decrease in the efect sizes for subjective well-being, psychological well-being, and depression, and a slight decrease for anxiety, but a strong increase for stress. Moderator analyses only showed a signifcant efect for study quality, showing larger efect sizes for low quality studies compared to studies of moderate and high quality. In addition, a larger efect size for anxiety was found in studies from non-Western countries compared to studies from Western countries. In sum, this systematic review and meta-analysis found evidence for the efcacy of MPPIs in improving mental health. We conclude that MPPIs have a small efect on subjective wellbeing and depression, and a small to moderate efect on psychological well-being. In addition, they may have a small to moderate efect on anxiety and a moderate efect on stress, but defnite conclusions of the efects of MPPIs on these outcomes cannot me made due to the limited number of studies. Further well-conducted research among diverse populations is necessary to strengthen claims on the efcacy of MPPIs.\n\nKeywords Positive psychology $\\cdot$ Well-being $\\cdot$ Positive mental health $\\cdot$ Multicomponent Randomized controlled trials $\\cdot$ Meta-analysis",

      "content": "The positive psychology movement intended to redirect the course of psychological research: away from a focus on pathology, diseases and defcits, and towards the study of human strengths, fourishing and the optimal functioning of individuals, groups, and institutions (Gable and Haidt 2005; Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi 2000; Sheldon and King 2001). Since its inauguration in 1998, the movement has made a considerable impact on the scientifc community, with an exponential growth of publications (Donaldson et al. 2015; Hart and Sasso 2011; Hendriks et  al. 2018b; Kim et  al. 2018; Rusk and Waters 2013). Positive psychology builds on the ideas of humanistic psychology, but employs state-of the art-research methods to ensure scientifc rigor (Froh 2004; Sheldon and Kasser 2001). Studies that investigate the efcacy of so-called positive psychology interventions (PPIs), are a cornerstone of psychological inquiry.\n\nThere has been much discussion on the defnition of PPIs. A broad defnition was introduced by Sin and Lyubomirsky (2009), who defned PPIs as all interventions that aim at increasing positive feelings, behaviors, and cognitions. Narrower defnitions were suggested by Bolier et  al. (2013b), who added that these interventions ‘should have been explicitly developed in line with the theoretical tradition of positive psychology’ (Bolier et  al. (2013b) and Parks and Biswas-Diener (2013), who suggested that an intervention can only be regarded as a PPI if sufcient empirical evidence exists suggesting signifcant efects for the intervention (Parks and Biswas-Diener 2013). Schueller and Parks (2014) argued that in addition to the (positive) aim of an intervention, the pathways through which the interventions operate is a second essential component when deciding if an intervention can be considered as a PPI. Building on these suggestions, we defne positive psychology interventions as interventions aiming at increasing positive feelings, behaviors, and cognitions, while also using theoretically and empirically based pathways or strategies to increase well-being.\n\nTo date, two meta-analyses have been published that examined the overall efcacy of PPIs. The frst meta-analysis included 51 controlled studies and found large efects for enhanced well-being $( r { = } 0 . 2 9 $ , $d \\cong 0 . 6 1$ ) and depressive symptoms $_ { r = 0 . 3 1 }$ , $d \\cong 0 . 6 5$ ) (Sin and Lyubomirsky 2009). The second meta-analysis included 39 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (Bolier et  al. (2013a, b) and reported small efect sizes $\\scriptstyle ( d = 0 . 3 4 )$ for subjective well-being, psychological well-being $\\scriptstyle ( d = 0 . 2 0 )$ ), and depression $\\scriptstyle { \\mathcal { A } } = 0 . 2 0$ ). Bolier et al. (2013a, b) argued that the efect sizes in the meta-analysis by Sin and Lyubomirsky might be overestimated, due to the application of less stricter inclusion criteria, for example by including non-randomized controlled trials and studies in the feld of mindfulness and life review therapy.",

Single component intervention studies usually consist of one or more positive psychology activities targeting one component of well-being. For example, studies on the efects of gratitude interventions (DeSteno et  al. 2015; Digdon and Koble 2011; Isik and Erguner-Tekinalp 2017; Lau and Cheng 2011), engaging in acts of kindness (Alden and Trew 2013; Buchanan and Bardi 2010; O’Connell et  al. 2016), and strengths-based interventions (Proyer et  al. 2015; Toback et  al. 2016). MPPIs may be considered as interventions that contain a variety of evidence-based individual exercises and targeting two or more theoretically relevant hedonic and eudaimonic well-being components, that are conducted within an integral program. Examples of theoretical components are the components of the PERMA-model (i.e. positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment) by Seligman (2018), and the components of the Synergetic Change Model (i.e. emotions, goals and habits, virtues and relationships, comprehension and coping, attention and awareness), which was developed by Rusk et al.

MPPIs contain a wide variety of positive activities that target diferent domains of mental well-being. Consequently, we expect that MPPIs have larger efects than have been found in prior meta-analyses of mainly single component interventions, both at post-treatment and at follow-up measurements. The secondary aims were to identify moderators that may infuence the relation between the intervention and the outcomes, determine the quality of the studies, and examine potential publication bias.",

      "content": "Data analyses were performed with the program Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA, version 3.3.070). We used the means, standard deviations, and sample sizes for each study, to calculate the efect size using dichotomous outcomes. For each comparison between a PPI and a control group, Hedges’ $g$ efect sizes were calculated to assess the betweengroup diferences at post-test. These efect sizes were calculated by subtracting the average score of the PPI group from the average score of the comparison group (both at post-test) and dividing the result by the pooled standard deviations obtained from the two groups. We used Hedges’ $g$ because this efect size measure is more accurate than Cohen’s $d$ when study sample sizes of the studies are small (Cuijpers 2016), which is the case in more than half of the studies we included. Similarly to Cohen’s $d$ , Hedges’ $g$ efect sizes of 0–0.32 can be considered as small, efect sizes of 0.33–0.55 as moderate, and efect sizes of 0.56–1.2 as large (Lipsey and Wilson 1993). In the calculation of efect sizes for depression, stress, and anxiety we used the scores on instruments that explicitly measured these outcomes. For subjective and psychological well-being, we also used scores from instruments related to these constructs of well-being. See “Appendix 1” for detailed information on the used instruments per outcome. If more than one measure was used for a particular outcome in one study, the pooled efect size was calculated. Thus, each study provided only one efect size for all outcomes. When available, we computed between-group efect sizes (Hedges’ g) for follow-up diferences. Follow-up efects were calculated if there was a minimum of fve studies per outcome.\n\nDue to the diverse populations, we expected considerable heterogeneity. Therefore, we performed the meta-analysis using a random efects model, with a $9 5 \\%$ confdence interval and using a two-tailed test. Separate meta-analyses were performed for subjective well-being, psychological well-being, depression, anxiety, and stress. Forest plots of post between-group efect sizes were produced for each outcome variable, both with and without outliers. We considered a study as an outlier when its $9 5 \\%$ confdence interval (CI) was outside the $9 5 \\%$ CI of the overall mean efect size (on either side). We tested for statistical heterogeneity between studies using the $\\mathrm { I } ^ { 2 }$ statistics, a measure of how much variance between studies can be attributed to diferences between studies, beyond the expected chance (Higgins and Green 2011). We used the $\\mathrm { I } ^ { 2 }$ statistic to estimate the percentage of heterogeneity across the studies not attributable to random sample error alone. A value of $0 \\%$ indicated no heterogeneity. Values of 25, 50, and $7 5 \\%$ refected low, moderate, and high degrees of heterogeneity, respectively (Higgins and Thompson 2002). Signifcant heterogeneity was indicated by a signifcant Q-statistic $( p < 0 . 0 5 )$ , meaning that one or more variables were present that moderated the observed efect size.\n\nExploratory subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the moderating efects of the following variables: (1) population types: clinical and non-clinical; (2) intervention: MPPI and MPPI combined with another therapy form; (3) delivery mode: group intervention, individual therapy, and self-help; (4) control group: active and non-active controls; (5) number of sessions: eight or less, more than eight; (6) duration of program: 8 weeks or less, more than 8 weeks; (7) quality rating: low quality (score of 0, 1, 2), moderate quality (score of 3, 4), high quality (score of 5, 6); (8) region: Western or non-Western.\n\nWe assessed publication bias in the following ways. First, we created a funnel plot by plotting the overall mean efect size against study size. Absence of publication bias is present when there is a symmetric distribution of studies around the efect size, while a higher concentration of studies on one side of the efect size than on the other indicates publication bias (Sterne et al. 2008). Second, we calculated a fail-safe N, a formal test of funnel plot asymmetry, for each analysis. This fail-safe N indicates the number of unpublished non-signifcant studies that would be required to lower the overall efect size below signifcance (Egger et al. 1997; Orwin 1983). Findings were considered robust if the failsafe $\\mathrm { N } \\geq 5 k + 1 0$ , where $k$ is the number of studies (Rosenberg 2005). Third, we used the trim- and-fll method (Duval and Tweedie 2000). This procedure imputes the efect sizes of missing studies and produces an adjusted efect size accounting for the missing studies.",

      "content": "Outcomes that were classifed as subjective well-being included happiness, emotional and subjective well-being, satisfaction with life, positive afect, quality of life, and well-being. Outcomes that were classifed as psychological well-being included fourishing, authentic living, personal growth, meaning, autonomy, (work) engagement, psychological capital, environmental well-being, positive relations, purpose in life, and self-acceptance. All studies included at least one measure of a particular outcome.\n\nIn total, we found 39 studies that measured subjective well-being, 24 studies measured psychological well-being, 31 studies measured depression, 11 studies measured anxiety, and eight studies measured stress. An overview of the questionnaires that were used to measure the outcomes is shown in “Appendix $3 ^ { \\circ }$ . Five studies included two measures for subjective well-being, which were pooled by the authors of the current meta-analysis (Cheung et al. 2017; Gelfn et al. 2018; Hausmann et al. 2017; Hendriks 2018; Mohammadi et al. 2018). Six studies (Chaves et al. 2017; Dyrbye et al. 2016; Ivtzan et al. 2016; Mohammadi et al. 2018; Myers et al. 2017; Rogerson et al. 2016) included two or more measures for psychological well-being that

      "level": 1,
      "content": "The aim of this study was to examine the efcacy of multi-component positive psychology interventions (MPPIs) across randomized controlled trials. Following a systematic literature search, we included 51 articles describing 50 studies on the efects of MPPIs in our meta-analysis. We conclude that over the past 6 years, there has been a sharp increase in the number of RCTs involving MPPIs. In comparison, a meta-analysis of PPIs by Bolier et  al. (2013a, b) that featured studies from 1998 to November 2012, included 34 single component PPIs and merely fve MPPIs. Analyses of all studies suggest that MPPIs have small to moderate efect sizes for subjective well-being $\\scriptstyle ( g = 0 . 3 4 )$ , psychological wellbeing $\\scriptstyle ( g = 0 . 3 9 )$ , anxiety $( g = 0 . 3 5 )$ , and stress $( g = 0 . 3 5 )$ , and a small efect size for depression $g = 0 . 2 9 ,$ . After removing outliers, the efect sizes decreased for subjective well-being $\\scriptstyle ( g = 0 . 2 4 )$ , psychological well-being $\\scriptstyle ( g = 0 . 3 5 )$ , and depression $( g = 0 . 2 1 )$ , but increased for stress $\\scriptstyle { \\overset { \\prime } { g } = 0 . 4 9 } )$ . There were no outliers for anxiety. Removing low quality studies led to similar conclusions compared to the analyses without the low quality studies, in part because the outliers were often of low quality. Follow-up results showed small efects for subjective well-being $\\scriptstyle ( g = 0 . 2 7 )$ , and psychological well-being $( g = 0 . 3 2 )$ . The efect size for depression increased to moderate $\\scriptstyle ( g = 0 . 4 5 )$ ), while the efect size for anxiety sharply dropped $\\scriptstyle ( g = 0 . 0 9 )$ ). Follow-up efects for stress were not calculated due to the limited amount of studies that included follow-up assessments.\n\nOur fndings on subjective well-being, psychological well-being, and depression are in line with two previous meta-analyses of RCT’s on the efect of PPIs. Bolier et al. (2013a, b) reported small efects on these outcomes, and a recent meta-analysis by Chakhssi et al. (2018) in clinical samples with psychiatric or somatic disorders, also reported small efects on well-being and depression. According to the Synergistic Change Model (Rusk et  al. 2018) lasting positive change as a result of a PPI, is most likely to occur when interventions are targeted at multiple domains of positive functioning. The model suggests that targeting multiple domains decreases the risk of relapse and increases the likelihood of spillover efects and synergy between the various activities. We expected to fnd higher efect sizes for all outcomes well-being and depression, since MPPIs target multi-domains of positive functioning. Although larger efect sizes on subjective well-being, psychological well-being, and depression were not found, compared to the studies of Bolier et al. (2013a, b) and Chakhssi et al. (2018), the efect sizes were still of small to moderate magnitude. Our meta-analysis is the frst that found promising results for PPIs on anxiety, and stress in particular. Still, the total number of studies that reported on these outcomes was limited, so caution is warranted when drawing conclusions on the efects of MPPIs on anxiety and stress.\n\nExplorative subgroup analyses revealed mainly no signifcant results, indicating that we could not identify study or intervention characteristics that led to more or less efectivity of MPPIs. We only found that two moderators may have infuenced the outcomes on depression. Low quality studies had a signifcant higher efect size than moderate or high quality studies. Our fnding that studies of lower quality have a higher efect size on depression is in line with the fndings of the meta-analysis of Bolier et al. (2013a, b). However, they reported a higher efect size for low quality studies compared to studies from moderate quality, rather than studies of high quality. In addition, Bolier and colleagues also reported signifcant higher efects for low quality studies compared to moderate quality studies on subjective well-being and psychological well-being, whereas we did not. The meta-analysis by Chakhssi et al. (2018) reported a signifcant moderating efect of study quality only for well-being, and not for depression. Diferences can be explained by the fact that all metaanalyses used diferent criteria to measure quality. Bolier and colleagues assessed the study quality on fve criteria, of which two criteria difered from the criteria that were used in our study, whereas Chakhssi and colleagues used six criteria, of which fve were the same as the criteria we used.\n\nIn addition, we found that the region of origin of the studies had a signifcant moderating efect on depression: studies from non-Western countries reported higher efect sizes than studies from Western countries. Diferences in efect sizes between Western and non-Western countries are possibly confounded by study quality, because six of the ten low-quality studies on depression were from non-Western countries. The fndings in relation to the lower quality of studies from non-Western countries and possible large efect sizes are in line with a meta-analysis that we recently conducted on the efcacy of PPIs from non-Western countries (Hendriks et  al. 2018b). This study, that included $2 8 ~ \\mathrm { R C T s }$ , showed that PPIs from non-Western countries have moderate efect sizes on well-being, and large efects on depression and anxiety. Quality analysis, using the same six criteria that were used in this current study, revealed a mean quality score of 1.79 $\\mathrm { S D } { = } 1 . 7$ ), indicating a low quality. The quality analysis of the current meta-analysis showed that nonWestern studies had a mean rating score of 1.89 $( \\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 8 )$ ), compared to a mean rating score of 3.62 $\\mathrm { S D } { = } 1 . 5$ ) for Western countries. This diference was signifcant $( p < 0 . 0 5 )$ . Lower quality may contribute to higher efect sizes. An important aspect is sample size. Prior studies have shown that trials with small sample sizes tend to overestimate efect sizes (Slavin and Smith 2009; Zhang et al. 2013). Our analyses showed that the intervention groups in the studies from non-Western countries had much smaller sample sizes (mean $= 2 7$ ), than the groups in the studies from Western countries (mean $= 7 1$ ).",

      "content": "One of the strengths of this meta-analysis is its methodological rigor. It was conducted according to The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (Moher et al. 2009, 2010) and the recommendations of the Cochrane Back Review group (Higgins et  al. 2011). Another strength is the diferentiation of the intervention by region. In general, PPI studies from non-Western countries tend to report larger efect-size than studies from Western countries. Our moderator analysis showed the moderating efect is signifcant for depression. This fnding may contribute to a better understanding of the moderating efect of the region on the efcacy of PPIs, or at least to a broader examination on the possible reasons why there are diferences. We recommend that other researchers further examine the relationship between the ethnic/cultural background of the participants and the outcomes of interventions.\n\nWe believe there are several limitations related to the fndings of this study. First, there is a relatively small number of studies on anxiety $( n = 1 1 )$ ) and stress $( n = 8 )$ . In order to draw frmer conclusions on the efects of MPPIs on these outcomes, more RCTs are needed. Second, there is also a limited number of studies for all subgroups. For example, while for psychological well-being there were 18 studies conducted among non-clinical populations, we only found six studies among clinical populations that measured the efects of the MPPIs. With such a small sample of studies, defnite conclusions on the efects of MPPI on psychological well-being among the clinical population cannot be drawn. With a limited number of studies and, on average, a high level of heterogeneity, the impact of excluding a single study could also have a high impact. This was illustrated in our fndings for stress: based on eight studies we found an efect size of $g = 0 . 3 5$ (a small to moderate efect). However, after removing one outlier (of low quality) the efect size for stress increased to $g = 0 . 4 9$ (moderate efect). The third limitation applies to the quality of the studies, or better said: the lack thereof. Only $2 6 \\%$ of the studies could be classifed as high-quality studies $( n = 1 3 )$ ), $4 2 \\%$ of the studies $( n = 2 1$ ) were classifed as moderate, and $3 2 \\%$ of the studies were classifed as low-quality studies $( n = 1 6 )$ ). The main reasons for the lack of quality are the omission of randomization procedures $5 2 \\%$ of the studies), the failure to state whether or not allocation of the participants was concealed $( 5 2 \\% )$ , and the failure to state whether or not the outcome assessment was blinded $(42 \\% )$ . Furthermore, 29 studies $( 5 8 \\% )$ conducted completers-only analyses, as opposed to intention-to-treat analyses, thereby increasing the risk of selection bias (Yelland et  al. 2015). Another aspect is that the majority of the studies is weakly powered: 28 of the 50 studies $( 5 6 \\% )$ had a population less than 50 participants per condition. Twenty-two studies $(44 \\% )$ even had less than 30 participants in the intervention group. Studies with low power have a weak predictive value, have a low probability of fnding an efect or exaggerate the magnitude of the efect when an efect is discovered (Button et al. 2013; Slavin and Smith 2009).",

      "content": "Despite the limitations, we conclude that MPPIs have a small efect on subjective wellbeing and depression, and a small to moderate efect on psychological well-being, and possibly anxiety and stress. However, the limitations also warrant some implications for future research. Firstly, there is a need for a more rigorous methodological approach in studies in the feld of positive psychology, which should lead to higher quality studies. This recommendation is a reoccurring one, which have been stated in some previous PPI metaanalyses as well (Bolier et al. (2013a, b; Weiss et al. 2016). Considering the explicit call for more rigorous research methods to study well-being which is often heard in positive psychology (Diener 2009; Froh 2004; Linley and Joseph 2004; Linley et al. 2006), we recommend that future studies should at least be based on a power-analysis to avoid the risk that clinical trials fail to detect meaningful diferences (Adams-Huet and Ahn 2009), or include a minimum of 50 participants per condition. We also highly recommend that future studies pay more attention to methodological reporting and follow protocols guidelines such as the CONSORT (Moher et al. 2010) or the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (Chan et al. 2013). In light of the growing number of RCTs from non-Western countries, this recommendation particular applies to studies from such countries, since nine of the eleven non-Western studies we included had a low study quality rating. Secondly, due to the high heterogeneity of the studies it was not possible to determine the optimal conditions under which studies could maximize their efcacy, for example the most efective intervention period or number of sessions. In conclusion, our fndings show for the frst time the overall efcacy of MPPIs and the subgroup analyses contribute to a better understanding of the efectiveness of MPPIs. Future studies among of higher quality and more diverse populations could enrich the feld of positive psychology and mental health and contribute to more insight into the optimal conditions to design the most efective positive psychology interventions.",
