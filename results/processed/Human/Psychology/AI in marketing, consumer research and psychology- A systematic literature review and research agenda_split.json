      "content": "The field of artificial intelligence (Al) is experiencing a second renaissance since computers appeared first in the 195Os (Tan & Lim, 2018).This is partly explained by advances in computing and big data capabilities which enabled computer scientists to develop algorithmic models that can identify patterns and learn in real time.Today,Al applications go beyond purely computing fields and are deployed in a rapidly increasing number of contexts and devises.These include smartphones (Makridakis,2O17),recommender systems (Zhang et al., 2021),and customer service (Belanche et al., 2O2O; Lu et al., 2020; Wirtz et al.,2O18). They even take on advanced roles in fields that were previously considered to be reliant on human intellect such as in journalism (Carlson,2O15), creative roles like painting (Quackenbush,\n\n2018) and music production (Marshall, 2018), (Tufekci, 2015) and marketing (Sterne,2017).\n\nWhile Al is experiencing exponential growth in adoption by marketing managers and consumers,to the best of our knowledge, there is no study covering comprehensively and holistically the body of knowledge produced on Al in the closely related fields of marketing, consumer research,and psychology.This is surprising as the psychological underpinnings of Al adoption in consumer behavior and use of Al in marketing are often tightly related to research in the broader psychology field.Furthermore,the importance of understanding psychological processes to the field of Al is evident.Scientists that began working on Al had the ultimate goal to develop machines that could perform a task that,if conducted by a human, would require intelligence (McCarthy et al.,2OO6).Therefore,an understanding of how cognitive processes can be replicated by algorithms has become essential.The link with the field of marketing is also critical as marketing represents one of the most important application areas for Al (Sterne,2O17).Accordingly,this literature reviewaims to answer the following research question:\n\nWhat is the intellectual structure of the marketing,consumer research,and psychology literature related to Al?\n\nTo address our research question, the paper is organized as follows.Section 2 reviews the conceptual underpinnings and sheds light on the recent debate on Al in the three fields of study.Section 3 describes the methodology and research design.Section 4 discusses our findings regarding the descriptive analysis,keyword occurrence, the themes that emerged from the bibliographic coupling analysis, the theoretical lenses used in the three literatures,and emerging theories.Section 5 presents suggestions for further research.",

      "content": "This paper aims to map the intellectual structure of three areas of marketing,consumer research,and psychology knowledge in relation to Al.Therefore,this section defines the conceptual underpinnings of Al ineach of these fields to inform this systematic literature review (SLR).\n\nMarketing is defined as the activity,set of institutions,and processes for creating,communicating,delivering,and exchanging offerings that have value for customers,clients,partners,and society at large (American Marketing Association,2O17).Marketing as a discipline has evolved due to rapid technological changes.In its research priorities for 202O-2022,the Marketing Science Institute describes Al as an important technology that has impact on the capabilities and accountability of marketing management and in the optimization of marketing functions and strategies (Marketing Science Institute,2020).\n\nConsumption,consumer studies,and consumer research are fundamental parts of contemporary society and of interest not only to marketers,but also to policy makers and other research disciplines (Maclnnis et al.,2O2O). There is a variety of interactions that consumers currently have with Al.Marketing researchers recognize that\n\nAl offers important potential benefits for consumers and their lives (e.g.,Pitardi et al.,2O21).However, there are also inherent tensions the increased use of Al can have on consumers,which include privacy concerns,dehumanization,and even addiction (Lobschat etal., 2021; Puntoni et al., 2021).\n\nThe field of psychology emerged early onas discipline of great importance to the investigation of behavior in the marketplace and marketing science (Alderson,1952).Psychology focuses on the study of the mind and how it influences our behaviors,and ranges from communications，memory，and decision making，to perceptions, thought,and emotions (British Psychological Society,2O21).Despite the fact that marketing has drawn on several social science disciplines suchas sociology and cultural anthropology，psychological theories remain at the core of consumer behavior and marketing research.\n\nThe intersection between marketing，consumer research,and psychology has been underpinned historically by the shift from using mostly economic models to explain consumer choice to a focus on psychological theories.These psychological theories draw on models fromsocial psychology，motivational psychology，environmental psychology,and education psychology (Hansen,1976). By embracing theories from psychology and other social sciences,consumer research has increasingly focused on gaininga deeper understanding of the thinking,desires,and experiences of individual consumers (Malter et al., 2020).\n\nAl has been defined as“the use of computational machinery to emulate capabilities inherent in humans,such as doing physical or mechanical tasks,thinking,and feeling\"(Huang& Rust,2O21,p.31). Historically,Al emerged almost at the same time as the first computers,but more recently,Al has gained momentum as new applications are possible due to rapid advances in computer power and a wide range of technologies (e.g., computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing),and an explosion of available data to train algorithms (Bornet et al., 2021).\n\nThe increasing relevance of Al in marketing is witnessed by the emergence of several literature reviews on the topic.For example, Mustak et al. (2O21) conducted topic modeling using natural language processing.They identified ten research topics in the area of marketing and Al that were later classified in relation to two major pillars: (1) consumer research,and (2) organization and strategy-related research.Vlacic et al. (2O21) reviewed the literature on Al/intelligent systems and marketing using content analysis combined with multiple correspondence analysis procedures and identified four themes: (1) marketing channels,(2) marketing strategy,(3) performance,and (4) segmentation,targeting and positioning.\n\nOur study is distinctively different compared to past literature reviews and makes the following contributions.First,our article is the first to focus on Al in the interrelated fields of marketing,consumer research and psychology,and provides an integrated view of these three streams of literature.Second,in addition to adopting bibliometric techniques,we examine the overarching intellectual structure emerging from the three steams of literature,and therefore,move beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries and look at the multidisciplinary linkages and dialogue between the three fields.Third,and as a corollary of the previous point,we identify and discuss the wide range of theoretical lenses adopted in this multidisciplinary area to facilitate a better understanding of Al research.\n\narticle citations,and number of citing articles with and without selfcitations)，journal sources,keywords,countries and regions,and author-level metrics (c.f., Martynov et al.,2020).",

      "content": "To generate an up-to-date overview of existing research on Al in marketing，consumer research,and psychology，and assess quantitatively the related literature,we carried out a SLR.SLRs are considered the appropriate tool to systematicallyassess and evaluate a given body of literature (Ginsberg & Venkatraman，1985).Additionally,as a comprehensive,structured,and analytical means of accurately organizing reviews,a SLR is an effective method to identify research gaps (Klassen etal.,1998; Paul & Criado,202O).Widely adopted in social sciences (Tranfield etal.,2Oo3),management,and marketing research (Christofi et al.,2O21;Paul & Feliciano-Cestero, 2021),a SLR offers a number of benefits,including the ability to construct flexible databases of articles that can easily be updated and interrogated (Pickering& Byrne,2014).\n\nData for our SLR was extracted and gathered from Scopus,one of the most comprehensive sources of indexed academic publications.It covers articles published since 1966,indexing 12,850 journals in fields such as physical sciences,health sciences,life sciences, and of course,social sciences (Archambault et al., 2Oo9). Scopus was chosen over Web of Science for two reasons.First,as scholars face a trade-off between data coverage and cleanliness, Scopus has been found to havea larger coverage ( $60 \\%$ larger) than WoS (Zhao & Strotmann,2O15).Second,SLRs and bibliometric studies in social sciences typically deploy only on one database to mitigate data homogenization issues faced when working with multiple databases (e.g., Galati & Bigliardi, 2019).\n\nTo search the database,we first identified a set of keywords related to Al in our three fields of study.Specifically,in line with a recent literature review of Al in marketing (Mustak et al., 2O21) the keywords identified were:“Al,”“artificial intelligence,”“machine learning,”“robot,”“automation,”“big data,”“neural network\\*,”“natural language processing,”“data mining,”“text mining,”“soft computing,”“fuzzy logic,”“biometrics,”\"geotagging,”“wearable\\*,”“loT,\" \"Internet of Things,”\"chatbot,”“smart technologies,”“Al service robots,”and“autonomous vehicles.\"\n\nWe ran a query using a combination of these keywords (adopting the Boolean operator ${ } ^ { \" } \\mathrm { O R } ^ { \\prime \\prime } .$ inthe fieldsrelatedto“title,”\"abstract,\" and “keywords.\"We took into account works published until June 15, 2021.We then narrowed down the sample by examining its intersection with the keywords “marketing,”\"consumer\\*,”and “psycho$\\mathsf { l o g } ^ { * }$ .”After excluding proceedings，book chapters，books，and materials not published in English,and confining the search to the subject areas “Business,Management and Accounting\"and “Psychology,\"the search yielded 4488 articles.\n\nFinally,we retrieved the metadata for these 4,488 articles which included author names,titles,country of corresponding author,total number of publications,citation counts (i.e.,total citations,average",

The results of our keyword cooccurrence analysis is shown in Figure 3.As is shown in Figure 3,the concepts of Al, big data and machine learning are central and closely interrelated.However, they are also connected to each of the other keyword co-occurrence networks.The keyword co-occurrence networks related to neural networks are more isolated and closely related to elements of learning memory,and decision making,which in turn link to marketing management functions such as market segmentation and customer relationship management.\n\nTABLE 1 Top 10 countries by number of documents\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td> Ranking</td><td> Country</td><td> Documents</td><td> % Documents</td><td> Citations</td><td> % Citations</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td> United States</td><td>1,622</td><td>29</td><td>61,818</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>UK</td><td>552</td><td>10</td><td>17,500</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>China</td><td>301</td><td>5</td><td>5197</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td> India</td><td>264</td><td>5</td><td>1635</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Germany</td><td>252</td><td>4</td><td>6907</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td> Australia</td><td>237</td><td>4</td><td>7350</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Canada</td><td>202</td><td>4</td><td>4496</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td> Italy</td><td>181</td><td>3</td><td>3801</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>France</td><td>139</td><td>2</td><td>3087</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td> Netherlands</td><td>135</td><td>2</td><td>4252</td><td>3</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nAs part of the keyword co-occurrence analysis,we were able to determine those keywords with the highest levels of occurrences and this is represented by the size of the circles in the visual representation of our co-occurrence analysis.We used the keywords with the highest occurrence in each keyword co-occurrence networks to name the keyword co-occurrence networks in our analysis: Big data,machine learning,Al,data mining,neural networks,marketing，and e-commerce.We discuss each of the keyword cooccurrence networks next, presented in order of occurrence.",

For instance,in the field of psychology,machine learning methodologies and theory are considered to have the potential to move away from mainly explanatory theories and models to more predictive ones (Yarkoni & Westfall,2O17). Similar expectations are also seen in the field of marketing,where early evidence on application of machine learning techniques in marketing activities (e.g.,in direct marketing campaigns) have witnessed improvements in forecasting models,therefore assisting marketers with decision making (Cui et al., 2006).",

Davenport etal.(2O2O)argue that Al will transform business models,sales processes,customer service, and consumer behavior.Changes in business models are anticipated to change how some industries structure their business models.For instance,in the context of retailing advancements in predictive analytics could mean a change from shopping and then shipping to a model where shipping is done first as predictive models are able to anticipate a purchase before it occurs.Changes in sales processes involve the use of real-time feedback to feed changes in sales pitches and communication materials.There are high expectations in terms of Al-enabled systems facilitating personalization of customer experiences (Kumar et al., 2O19)and helping marketers use a wide variety of solicited and unsolicited form of customer engagement to improve marketing outcomes (Perez-Vega et al.,2O21). Finally,changes in consumer behavior are related to the adoption of Al-enabled technologies for aspects related to information search as well as behavioral changes derived from advancements in technology (e.g., the implications on consumer behavior once self-driving cars become prevalent).\n\n[Image]\nFIGURE3Keyordcccurenceetworksinlesearchinthefieldsofarketigonsumereaviondpsyhogyrtiial intelligence",

Benefits of bibliographic coupling include the ability to provide visualization maps based on the most cited papers,presenting insights for current research concerns,and guidelines for upcoming research (Jones & Gatrell, 2014).\n\nWe conducted a bibliographic coupling analysis of articles,authors,and journals to create structure maps and present a clear picture of the evolution of scientific production on the focal topic of Alinour three scientific fields (c.f., Boyack& Klavans,2O1O;Mariani & Borghi,2O19；Mariani et al.，2021；Mariani & Baggio，2021; Pritchard,1969; Zupic & Cater 2015).

This produced eight clusters from 198 documents.Figure 4 illustrates the eight clusters and their main themes.The clusters to the right side (clusters 1-3), just like the right hemisphere of the human brain,focus mainly on memory and reasoning,and general cognitive processes. Those in the center (clusters 4 and 8) focus on specific aspects of how cognitive processes are translated into machine settings,as it is with the case of robotics and machine learning.Finally,the left side of the figure (clusters 5-7) shows the interaction between technology and humans and consumer psychology.These range from the acceptance,adoption and use of Al technology to analyzing consumer psychology using content analytics and text mining.The following sections explore each of these clusters in more detail.",

In the context of computer vision,computer systems and robots must also process millions of pixel values and given that visual perception is not separated from cognition,it is important to endow machines and robots with multiple sensors when performing visual tasks (Frintrop et al.,2010).\n\nWhile the inputs of vision are pixel values in the context of robots,the output of vision would consist of shape representations entailingat least surface layouts,edges and further details sufficiently rich to allow parts to be looked up in a shape-indexed memory to identify known objects，as was suggestedby Pylyshyn (1999).",

Recent work in this cluster developed connections between the scholarly understanding of those cognitive processes and the advances in Al that emulate some of them.Despite this progress in technology, there are challenges Al still faces.For example, Lake et al.

Sociality relates to the human need to form social connection with other humans,whilst effectance relates to the need to interact effectivelywith one's environment.Finally,elicitation of agent knowledge relates to the knowledge agents gather about humans and their behavior.A combination of the three factors are considered to explain the anthropomorphism of objects.In relation to this psychological phenomena,neurophysiological research has found that humans react more to a nonanthropomorphic robot when a human interacts in a social way with the robot as opposed than when interacting in a functional way (Hoenen et al., 2016).\n\nNotable research in this area examines how,as we move towards building robots that look and behave like humans,emerging concerns about deception,privacy,job loss,safety,and the loss of human relationships become more prevalent (Broadbent,2O17).Of interest is also the work of Araujo (2O18) on disembodied conversational agents (chatbots) and the extent to which human-like cues such as language style and name influence perceptions about social presence as well as mindful and mindless anthropomorphism.",

Clearly,cross-fertilization between these fields should advance our understanding of Al as each field explores similar issues from their discipline's particular lens.\n\nSecond, in addition to adopting bibliometric techniques,we focused on the overarching intellectual structure emerging from the three steams of literature and therefore move beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries and look at the multidisciplinary linkages and dialogue between these three fields.As such,this SLR study is by definition multidisciplinary and identifies topical areas in a holistic process.This means, for instance, that marketing phenomena are captured also in relation to their psychological drivers which is in line with the philosophy,aim and scope of Psychology& Marketing (Donthu etal.,2021).\n\nIn particular,we compellingly connect and synthetize theory found in the literature (Vargo & Koskela-Huotari,2O2O) by identifying eight major clusters where research in the focal areas have developed. Through our analysis of keywords occurrence,we were able to identify the keyword co-occurrence networks in this field (which we named using the term occurring more frequently within the network): big data, machine learning,Al,data mining,neural networks,marketing,and ecommerce.Furthermore,using bibliographic coupling,we identify topical areas and illustrate the relationships that exist between the topical areas in the literature.\n\nUsing bibliographic coupling eight clusters of research were identified which range from those that are heavily reliant on computer science (memory and computational logic，neural network，machine learning and linguistic analytics),psychological sciences (decision making and cognitive processes),and themes related to technology acceptance/ adoption and applications to marketing and consumer research (technology acceptance and adoption,big data and robots, social media and text mining and social media content analysis).\n\nThird,and as a corollary of the previous point,we identify and discuss the wide range of theoretical lenses and models adopted to get to a better understanding of Al.This attention to theoretical lenses and models can help not only to connect studies formally belonging to the different literatures,butalso to cross-fertilize the use of theories across fields.Specifically,we identified a total of 412 different theories and models,with the most frequently used being: Game theory,theory of mind,theory of planned behavior,computational theories,BRT,decision theories,evolutionary theory,flow theory,fuzzy theories,graph theory, institutional theory,ART,cognitive dissonance theory,CCT,and UTAUT (including its predecessor,the TAM).\n\nFinally,we identified a number of emerging theories in the literature that could help to advance knowledge in Al. They are anthropomorphism, CLT,ANT,and RBT.",

These clusters could be linked to each other and thus reconfigured into three macro-clusters (as clarified in Section 4.3) due to the proximity of the topical areas of the clusters.The first macro-cluster includes articles that are heavily reliant on computer science (memory and computational logic,neural network,machine learning and linguistic analytics).We predict that several research opportunities can arise and contribute to the expansion of this macro-cluster in the future as cross-disciplinary studies involving computer science,brain science and social sciences might become increasingly relevant. In this area,research on explainable Al will help overcome some of the emerging challenges around the use Al in daily settings,particularly in terms of improving transparency and trust, enabling auditing of Al systems for regulatory reasons,and to enable adjusting of Al systems when they behave unexpectedly.The second macro-cluster includes articles that relate mostly to psychological sciences (decision making and cognitive processes).This is an area that has already witnessed some growth but could record further evolution as an increasing number of Al scholars from outside the psychology field team up with psychology experts to understand the psychological underpinnings of human perceptions of and interaction with Al. The third macrocluster entails studies related to technology acceptance/adoption and applications to marketing and consumer research (technology acceptance and adoption,big data and robots,social media and text mining and social media content analysis).While this is a relatively mature area,further research is likely to cover Al technologyacceptance and adoption as Al technologies evolve further.",

      "level": 1,
      "content": "The different clusters can cross-fertilize each other not only in terms of commonalities of topics,but also in terms of theories.For example, decision theories can be adopted in conjunction with game theories to generate added value in studies that will focus on data-driven models.For example,evidence suggest that some marketing activities could be outperformed by automated systems relying on machine learning (Salminen et al.,2O19). Here,decision theories and game theories might help build stronger frameworks whereby theoretically driven explanatory models based on game-theoretical decision making can be combined with data-driven predictive models of consumer behavior.This will extend work that has been carried out in the following clusters:social media and text mining;big data and robots.\n\nBRT could be integrated by scholars into several different clusters and blended with TAMs and theories.Indeed,it might be increasingly leveraged in acceptance and adoption studies to contextualize the reasons for/against adopting a technology depending on the type of technology and the context specific to that technology.For instance,the reasons for/against adopting Al technology are significantly different in healthcare versus consumer goods contexts and blending BRT with technology acceptance might shed light on factors positively or negatively influencing the adoption behaviors of Al technology across distinctively different settings. Furthermore,some technologies that rely more on the disclosure of personal data to allow customization might lead to higher levels of privacy concerns as a barrier of adoption (Lobschat et al., 2021).\n\nCCT might generate opportunities to advance our understanding of how the growing use of Al technologies and social media platforms influence cultural production (e.g.,Rokka,2O21) and the way consumers make sense of cultural production.For instance,Al-powered algorithms used by music streaming platforms that allow to match past preferences with music and songs' libraries,could constrain the way consumers can discover new music genres or soundtracks.This in turn might prevent consumers from designing their own cultural choices due to increasingly standardized and backward-looking cultural categories (e.g.,established music genres).In general, CCT might help explain to what extent data analytics and the use of algorithms are somehow making consumers less proactive in identifying their own cultural tastes and more prone to passively accept what algorithms recommend.",

      "heading": "6.3丨Neglected research topics",
      "level": 1,
      "content": "We were surprised that important topics did not seem to get the research attention we feel they should deserve.First,Al-related ethics,fairness and privacy are probably the most important topics that have not had the prominence they deserve in our three fields of study.In addition to concerns related to privacy,the unprecedented power of Al (Bornet et al.,2O21；Brynjolfsson & McAfee,2017) poises important ethical dilemmas (Belk,2O2O; Breidbach & Maglio, 2020;Rahwan et al., 2O19). These include how customer data are used in Al systems for automated decision making (e.g.,whether and at what interest rate to approve a housing loan) which can result in biased and unfair consumer outcomes (e.g.,a loan rejection and overpricing).At a higher level,Al can cause concern related to loss of autonomy,dignity,social isolation,dehumanization,and more (Belk, 2020; Caic et al., 2018; Vandemeulebroucke et al. 2018).\n\nRecent work on corporate digital responsibility (CDR) integrated these topics,whereby CDR relates to the ethical responsibilities organizations (including marketing departments) need to face when creating and operating Al and other digital technologies and the data they produce (Wirtz et al.,2O21).CDR seems especially important when digital platform business models are involved as they largely operate via scalable and autonomous Al and provide complete visibility of all actors and their behaviors on the a platform (Rangaswamy et al.,2O2O).Lobschat etal.defined CDR as a “set of shared values and norms guiding an organization's operations with respect to the creation and operation of digital technology and data\"(p.876).Organizations (and their marketing and service departments) need to ensure that customers are treated ethically,fairly and that their privacy rights are protected.We need more research to better understand how to do this and what the customer implications of good (and bad) CDR are.\n\nSecond,it is easy to see the downsides of Al and the literature has examined many potential consumer concerns related to Al and why consumers may not want to use it (e.g., Lu et al.,2O2O). However,there are also advantages consumers value.For instance,consumers have been shown to prefer Al- over people-delivered service in potentially embarrassing situations (Pitardi etal.,2O21).As would be predicted by theory of mind and agency,Al's inability to make social judgments may be an advantage in other contexts,such as in situations where consumers can feel unpleasant emotions such as shame,shyness,and guilt.We feel that more work is needed to better understand consumer benefits of Al.\n\nFinally,there is significant Al literature in (service) operations management that has focused on productivity gains, service improvements (e.g.,enhanced convenience,availability,better affordability， and frictionlesscustomerjourneys)，and end-to-end automation of customer service processes (e.g.,Wirtz & Zeithaml, 2018). Likewise,the computer science literature has a long tradition of Al research (e.g.， Jordan & Mitchell,2O15),and it would be of interest to examine the applicability of the theories used in these field in marketing contexts.",
