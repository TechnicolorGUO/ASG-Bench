It changes the structure, aims, and networking mechanisms of the overall business system and, ultimately, affects the various levels and dimensions of the innovation system. Bringing inevitable changes to the innovation system, digital technologies may not only provide new business opportunities but also be disruptive and cause new vulnerabilities. In order to gain a rigorous understanding of the hybrid concept of digital entrepreneurship and its role within the transformation of the innovation system, we conducted a systematic literature review. The results of 52 core papers allow for the identification of key categories of digital entrepreneurship and also its differentiation from other types of business activities. The analysis leads to the distinction of the determinants of digital entrepreneurship within three core dimensions of the innovation system, which encompass the entrepreneur (including, e.g., behavioral, competence. and mentality patterns, as well as personal outcomes and consequences of entrepreneurial activity), the entrepreneurial process (including activities that concern digitalization in organizational management processes, transformations within strategic and operational activities, and digital start-up establishment), and its relevant ecosystem (which encompasses, among others, the influence that external infrastructure and institutions have on digital entrepreneurship development). The systematization of the existing literature is highly relevant for future research that aims to understand the interrelations between the transformation of entrepreneurial structures within innovation systems as well as the socioeconomic system in general. Such understanding requires further extended research in fields related to method, content, and theory.",

      "content": "In the last century, the economic performance and innovation success of countries has increasingly depended on digital technology developments [1]. Digitalization is broadly associated with the changes that relate to big data analytics, the adoption of digital technologies, and an increase in their utilization [2–4]. Research shows that the rates of digitalization continue to grow. According to the Digital Economy and Society Index (see Appendix A), the level of digital performance of EU countries increased to $5 2 . 4 5 \\%$ in 2019 compared to $4 4 . 3 5 \\%$ and $3 9 . 0 5 \\%$ in 2016 and 2014, respectively (see  Compared to digitization, which refers to the digital conversion of information, digitalization concerns the broad implications of such processes and their subsequent effects on various contexts of the socioeconomic system [5]. Therefore, digitalization may also be considered one of the coupling mechanisms between different dimensions of the socioeconomic system (technological, social, economic, and ecological). For this reason, digitalization represents a source of new challenges to the resilience of socioeconomic systems; on the one hand, it comes with opportunities, but on the other, it also brings new risks and unforeseen consequences [6,7]. Therefore, it becomes important to deal with such challenges in a sustainable and future oriented manner (corresponding also to the principles of the Sustainable Development Goals).\n\nAlthough digitalization concerns all spheres of social life [2], it primarily determines the transformation of entrepreneurial and business models in different industries. The main reason for this is the changing needs of society (either caused by new demands or pushed by industry) regarding products and services (e.g., enhanced connectivity and individualization) that determine adaptations in the value-creation process as well as communication and cooperation patterns; this process, in turn, fosters innovative transformations of business models [8–10].\n\nBy challenging and restructuring business patterns in all industrial sectors, digitalization becomes, on the one hand, an outcome and, on the other hand, a source for innovation, while entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs may be not only the drivers but also the affected agents of digital transformations. Innovations and, consequently, the innovation system may be considered a metasystem in which entrepreneurial activities become the driving force for the utilization of digital opportunities (see the section titled Innovation System Conception). Hence, digital entrepreneurship—as a process and as an outcome—is a mechanism within the innovation system that is related to the formation of new ventures or the transformation of existing businesses [11], with novel ways of value creation [12,13], that becomes a driving force for innovation development [8,14,15].\n\nThe crucial role of digitalization as a driver of transformation within innovation systems is evidenced both by scientific research (e.g., [9,14,15]) and policy-related surveys of the European Commission, which show that $9 6 \\%$ of business leaders consider digital technologies to be critical for innovative development and continuous, qualitative economic growth [16]. Therefore, considering digital entrepreneurship within the innovation system is crucial for understanding its potential impacts on transformations and sustainable transitions of such systems. In that case, we do not focus on entrepreneurial ecosystems individually. Instead, we consider them within the dimensions of the innovation system.\n\nDigital technologies may not only result in business opportunities; they may also, simultaneously, be disruptive and cause new vulnerability spaces [17,18]. This is particularly true since, within the reframing of business models, digital technologies have an impact on the various levels of the innovation system (see the Innovation System Conception section), reshaping industry competition and networking patterns within this system [14]. Furthermore, the integration of digitalization in business processes implicates not only internal changes related to new organizational management strategies and entrepreneurial processes. External system conditions (e.g., institutional influence, new market tendencies, changes in competitive advantages) as well as social attitudes (e.g., digital trust, technology adoption) also have a significant effect. An analysis of the framework conditions for digital entrepreneurship in 28 EU countries in 2018 showed Denmark, Sweden, Luxembourg, and Finland as leaders, with an average rate of 75.7 on the European Index of Digital Entrepreneurship Systems (EIDES) (see Appendix A). Comparatively, the average rate of the EIDES for the country followers (e.g., Germany, Austria, France) was 52.3 [19]. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the whole mechanism of digital entrepreneurship with respect to its role within the innovation system, particularly its transformations and sustainable transitions. This includes, among others, changes in the communication and interaction patterns of involved innovation agents, opportunity assessment, and resource considerations as part of a comprehensive and sustainable innovation process. Consequently, the aim of the research was to (1) derive a clear understanding of how digital entrepreneurship efforts are embedded within the innovation system and coupled with its relevant subsystems; and (2) determine future avenues for contributing sustainability implications of entrepreneurship and innovation research.\n\nIn order to gain a deeper understanding of these interrelated systems, we applied a comprehensive systematic literature review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses approach (PRISMA) for analyzing existing approaches to digital entrepreneurship conceptions and for a better understanding of these conceptions’ interrelatedness with the innovation system. The following research questions were posed:\n\n(1) What are the key categories that define digital entrepreneurship and its role within the innovation system, particularly differentiating it from other types of entrepreneurship? (2) How are digital initiatives implemented within entrepreneurship processes (either transforming existing processes or establishing new ones), particularly with respect to involved agents, opportunities and risks, resources, processes, and other factors?\n\nTo clarify the research questions, we defined the key determinants of digital entrepreneurship and analyzed their interconnections and links with the innovation system. The article is organized as follows. In the section Innovation System Conception, we explain the validity of the innovation system approach for understanding digital entrepreneurship as a specific challenge and its impacts on transformation processes. Based on the generalization of existing theories and approaches, we provide the structure of the innovation system. The Research Design section describes the working process and research design that was applied for the systematic literature review. In the section titled Approach to the Review: PRISMA Method, we provide a detailed description of the PRISMA method and explain how it was implemented in our research (including search terms, selection criteria, and exclusion criteria). The Results of Systematic Literature Review section contains the overview of basic study characteristics and an overview of categories in digital entrepreneurship, defined within a systematic literature review. In the Discussion of the Results section, we analyze the defined categories and generalize them according to the determinants of digital entrepreneurship. In the section Future Research Directions for Sustainable Implications, we suggest avenues for method-, content-, and theory-related extensions in analyzing the impacts of digitalization on sustainable societal transitions.",

      "content": "In our research, the innovation system is considered as a metasystem that provides the conditions for entrepreneurial activities and further innovation performance (within both opportunities and limitations). This understanding is evidenced by studies in the field that relate an innovation system primarily to a network of elements that enables the generation and distribution of knowledge that enhances innovation performance (e.g., [20–25]).\n\nDealing with societal challenges and enhancing a system’s resilience, an innovation system may be understood as an interactive learning system with a focus on the enhanced learning capability of individuals, organizations, and regions as part of capacity building in order to meet new challenges and to enable an innovation-based economic performance [22,26]. An innovation system is formed not only on a macrolevel (as a network of institutions) but also on a microlevel (as an internal organization of the company with the system of internal relations) [27] and is characterized by hierarchical and structural dimensions. The hierarchical dimensions include the levels from the individual to the organizational, regional, national, subcontinental, continental, and global. Such divisions are also overlapped by sectoral and regional dimensions (e.g., urban, rural, metaregions). Within the structural dimensions, the innovation system may be defined by the following dimensions: (1) political, legal, and institutional; (2) sociocultural; (3) economic and financial; (4) technological; (5) ecological; and (6) infrastructural (physical and virtual space) dimensions. Figure 1 shows the structure of the innovation system.\n\n[Image]\nigure 1. Figure 1.Structure of the innovation system [28,29]. Structure of the innovation system [28,29].\n\nThe conception of an innovation system is related to the core principles of various theories. Particularly, the innovation system theory [21,22,26,30,31] describes the adaptive learning capabilities of innovation systems. The understanding of vulnerabilities (opportunities and risks) within the innovation system is very much based on the coupled human–environment system theory [32]. The transition of innovation systems within the time frames and their development and resilience, in addition to their impact on societal sustainability, is discussed within the panarchy [33], creative destruction [24], disruptive innovation [34], and transition theories [35–41].\n\nAn early explanation of innovation in light of the interdependency of different factors that define the structure of the innovation system goes back to Joseph Schumpeter. He identified the crucial role of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial leadership for the distribution and use of knowledge, ultimately leading to innovation [24]. Furthermore, according to Schumpeter (1934, 1942), innovation is considered a “new combination” of factors that determines “creative destruction” and relates to five core spheres, namely products, methods of production, markets, sources of raw materials, and industry structure [24,42]. The key role of entrepreneurs lies in undertaking Schumpeter’s “new factor combinations,” commercializing ideas and inventions, and creating new opportunities for investments and employment, enhancing, ultimately, economic competitiveness and change [24,42–46]. However, entrepreneurs’ contributions to knowledge formation and dissemination depend on their economic and technical competences and their knowledge, as well as their perception of the environment and opportunities [20,47]. In addition, another important determinant is the incentive for innovation, particularly the motivation for designing or following the innovative environment [48,49]. Schumpeter also identified important effects of non-economic factors within the innovation system, such as personal motivation and cultural and historical factors [43].\n\nThe implication of the innovation system approach for understanding digital entrepreneurship is based on the idea that digitalization, with its risks and opportunities, may be considered one of a number of societal challenges. The latter are complex in nature and cannot be seen in isolation but rather have implications ranging from a global scale to the company level and to each individual [50,51]. Therefore, to be understood and successfully managed, digital entrepreneurship requires a comprehensive innovation system approach that helps us to better understand the various effects of digitalization with respect to different stakeholders and dimensions of the system (see Figure 1).\n\nBy defining knowledge as a key element in an innovation system, researchers distinguish two approaches to the role of different institutions. The “narrow approach” considers, primarily, the impact of institutions on the acquisition, distribution, and use of knowledge [22], while the “broad approach” includes the effects of political, cultural, and economic factors and policies on institutions, their interaction, and further innovative performance [21].\n\nAn analysis of the statements above allows us to suggest that the innovation system may be defined as a system that couples a broad range of elements and their interactions on different levels (from internal management processes to institutional networks) that, under the effects of political, cultural, and other factors, form the conditions for knowledge creation and dissemination as well as further innovative performance. Strong driving forces of innovation systems are the entrepreneurial activities and initiatives that may lead, however, to “creative destruction.”",

The second dimension refers to activities related to digitalization in the organizational management process, transformations within strategic and operational activities, digital start-up establishment, etc. The third dimension relates to the influence that external infrastructure and institutions have on digital entrepreneurship development. Given these distinct dimensions, we suggest that, within the hierarchical structure of the innovation system, digital entrepreneurship relates to three core scopes, labeled here for conciseness: Entrepreneur, Entrepreneurial Process, and Ecosystem.

      "content": "An analysis of the initial nodes suggests that the dimension Entrepreneur relates primarily to the digital behavior patterns, social impact, and knowledge nodes. The variety of categories covers the range from digital entrepreneurial intentions to start a business [63] and the related decision-making process [62,64] to knowledge integration [66] and social outcomes for entrepreneurs [58–61].\n\nAs basic drivers of the innovation system, entrepreneurs are influenced by digital transformations, particularly in their behavior related to the adoption of digital stimuli and the evaluation of success opportunities [29,74]. Entrepreneurs’ personal attitudes are the initial drivers for entrepreneurial intentions and further decision-making processes [61,62] during the determination of a company’s aims, the identification of business opportunities, the evaluation of risks, and the formation of relevant business strategies [82]. Often, digital entrepreneurial perceptions are the consequence of existing attitudes toward entrepreneurship, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control [61,62,65] as well as external pressures and the internal digital maturity of the company [65]. Digital entrepreneurial perception is also strongly influenced by trust, which, although currently mentioned only infrequently in scientific articles, is considered in interdisciplinary research initiatives (e.g., the Digital Planet report, presented by The Fletcher School at Tufts University) [110].\n\nEntrepreneurial knowledge is a significant determinant in shaping the motivational process within digital and business engagement, together with career intentions and new venture creation [63]. In particular, digital competences become key determinants of digital entrepreneurship [72,104]. On the one hand, digital competences should be characterized as prerequisites for digital engagement since they define the possibility to be involved and remain competitive in the field. On the other hand, some researchers suppose that digital competences develop due to the digital transformation and “context” influence [104] and also knowledge integration and orchestration [58,66]. In other words, context dimensions affect the extent to which entrepreneurs may utilize their digital competences [104]. The effect of context is often reflected in the broadening of social networks that develop structural connections between individuals [105] and foster regional information and communications technology (ICT) access and entrepreneurship performance, also becoming a facilitator in the conditions of resource constraints and institutional barriers [108] (see also the Ecosystem dimension).\n\nThe process of knowledge acquisition is a prerequisite for learning orchestration and cognition, influenced not only by personal and behavioral factors but also by “environmental” factors [99]. Knowledge mobilization and knowledge coordination, in particular, are strongly affected by the diversity of the social network, the individual nodal position within it, and the “structural holes” effect [66]. Managers’ knowledge and motivation patterns determine how the key elements of a business model, such as production, commercialization and distribution, customer management, transaction mechanisms, partner and transaction management, labor policies, value creation, internal organizational management, etc., are transformed due to digital effects [74].\n\nGiven the new opportunities and risks associated with digital transformations, managers face dilemmas related to the availability and distribution of resources for the development of the information technologies (IT), privacy and security points, employee and customer policies, and ethics [64]. This also provides evidence for the “hybrid” and dual effect of digitalization, particularly in entrepreneurship, relating it to disruptive processes and vulnerability spaces. Dellermann et al. (2017) proposed a framework of strategic risk management in digital business model innovation that includes different categories of risks, dividing them into internal risks and risks from the external environment, or relational and performance risks [68]. Thus, a business strategy may be based on a business-, customer-, organizational-, and/or technology-centric orientation [84].\n\nWithin the sphere of personal outcomes, digital entrepreneurship may help overcome the problems of social positioning and sociocultural restrictions by transforming family relations [59,60], by involving women entrepreneurs [59], and by providing more opportunities for entrepreneurial activities within ethnic minorities [58]. However, digitalization may become a source of new inequalities [61], determining inclusion or exclusion to entrepreneurial activity due, in particular, to social, cultural, and institutional gaps [60] or resource restrictions [58].\n\nThe analysis of the initial nodes extracted from the literature sources (see Table 1) and suggestions about their interrelational patterns allow us to conclude that the scope of Entrepreneur is characterized by personal attitudes, competences, decision-making processes, knowledge, and personal outcomes [58–64,66,82,104]. Extending the obtained results with our own reflections, we may posit that the first three determinants of digital entrepreneurship are the following:\n\n1. Personal characteristics and competences: basic characteristics related to starting a digital business\n(e.g., gender, age, education, entrepreneurial knowledge, the entrepreneur’s knowledge about the\nbusiness environment); professional flexibility (e.g., ability to gain new competences, readiness for\ncontinuous education); 2. Decision-making and bounded rationality: opportunity–risk attitude (e.g., success evaluation,\nbusiness orientation and strategy, perception of business opportunities); personal motivation (e.g.,\nentrepreneurship intentions); and 3. Personal outcomes: social positioning (e.g., transformation of existing social linkages and\npositions, new facets in cultural norms and traditions, transformations within family relations); access\nto new entrepreneurial possibilities (e.g., digital inclusion, development of new social inequalities).",

      "content": "The Entrepreneurial Process connects initial nodes such as:\n\nDigital business models [64,67–74,76–80,82,83]; . Digital determinants [66,75,77,81]; . Digital and innovative orientation [84–86]; Start-ups [87–92]; • Value [80,93–97]; and . Marketing [58,69,98].\n\nWithin organizational management, digital transformation covers all levels from strategic to operational [64], as well as all its layers (resource, activity, and actor) [76]. Strongly interrelated with digital competences and based on the digital strategy of organization [94,97], digital transformation is a rather inevitable process that, on the one hand, may be considered to be a reactive step and, on the other hand, a voluntary entrepreneurial process [71].\n\nDigital technologies change business architecture through the transformation of business models. More specifically, the implementation of digital artifacts and the utilization of digital platforms, as well as other technical affordances, foster the formation of business model innovations that differ from traditional business frameworks along the entire value chain from production to commercialization [72]. These mechanisms are reflected in the convergence of digital business [79], as well as reprogrammability, recombinability, and generativity properties that allow the involvement of different digital artifacts and devices, separate the functional aspects and physical embodiment of the device, and provide further recombinations of elements for the development of further functionality of the device [73].\n\nThe ability of a company to participate in a digital transformation often depends on several prerequisites for business digitalization, such as digital orientation (within market and entrepreneurial orientations) [86], digital capabilities [69], and, particularly, managerial strategies based on an understanding of digital processes [80]. However, digital transformations depend on more than managerial actions and strategies. Schallmo et al. (2017) applied several categories in their work that outlined the preconditions for the development and implementation of a digital business model and combined them in a transformation roadmap. Several researchers consider, in addition, IT capability [75] and internal IT infrastructure maturity [65] as other important preconditions in an intensification of business digitalization and organizational performance during business transformations [85].\n\nGiven the conception that the organizational management process is determined by the internal and external environments, we may suggest that the intensity and success of business digitalization depend on the interconnections between internal and external factors. External factors are strongly affected by spatial, spillover, and temporal effects on entrepreneurial activity [90]. Internal factors are strongly connected to individual characteristics of entrepreneurs (managers and founders), the mission and objectives of a company, and the operational process within a business model (including value creation, revenue policies, customer relations, etc.) [92]. These interconnections also provide evidence for the effects of digitalization on businesses through the interconnection of entrepreneurs’ characteristics (see the Entrepreneur dimension) and ecosystem processes (see the Ecosystem dimension). The capability for digital model transformation is often supported by digital infrastructure [69]. Social media and big-data technologies are especially considered the main forces for change for a business model framework through the generation of relevant information for the business [67]. Strategic learning helps transform the information into strategic knowledge and provides companies with the capability to adapt to changes or develop a market-entry strategy [69]. These critical insights into entrepreneurial knowledge and, consequently, the assessment of business risks, vulnerabilities, and opportunities are facilitated by digital platforms [73] that provide a field for the interaction of multiple actors [77]. This interaction may include resource and module networks for start-up and scale-up success and access to financial and human resources and venture investors [81,111]. This can be especially critical in the case of early-stage start-ups, which are based on a business model innovation in order to remain competitive within a dynamic environment. Scholars consider the Lean Startup Approach to be a method for the formation and evaluation of the appropriate business model since it allows entrepreneurs to test and refine their business hypotheses by redirecting production systems toward customer value [87,88,112,113]. Digital entrepreneurship also provides new value categories (i.e., functional, social, emotional, epistemic, conditional) and new value opportunities based on stakeholder interaction and new approaches for competing in digital ecosystems [96,106]. Several scholars claim that, in a business framework, digital solutions are strongly interrelated with value creation and revenue policies. In particular, as noted above, digital solutions may change the value chain by reducing some costs (e.g., reproduction, distribution, transaction costs) [95,97] or resource configurations [93] that may lead to the formation of sustainable business models [69,70]. These elements of business transformation in terms of digitalization also determine the development of digital entrepreneurship toward the formation of IT clusters (e.g., in India and the US) [91]. In regard to marketing activity, researchers also define several other affordances of digitalization. The advantages of a digital business model are correspondingly distinguished according to market entry (related to reduced entry costs, technological advantage as a competitive point, and/or digital services for setting the entry barriers) or resource availability [58,83]; the evaluation of decision-making efficiency; the optimization of strategies and processes for international market evaluation, particularly for lean global start-ups [89]; and the formation of communication ties and digital marketing tools [98].\n\nThe extended reflections based on the analysis of the initial nodes in the dimension of Entrepreneurial process allow us to distinguish four more determinants of digital entrepreneurship:\n\n1. Prerequisites for digitalization: digital capabilities (e.g., digital potential, internal digital infrastructure maturity, digital ambition and digital fit); adoption of digital drivers; and digital facilities (e.g., flexibility and generativity of digital platforms, social media and big data sources, information products); 2. Dynamic shifts in the transformation of business: digital features in operation activities (e.g., reprogrammability, recombinability, generativity, customer relations); merging of value creation (e.g., changing sources, new opportunities, shifts in value propositions); revenue mechanism (e.g., revenue models); competition and leadership (e.g., market position, market strategy, pioneering strategies for start-ups, digital monopolies); knowledge acquisition and strategic learning (e.g., information-sharing capabilities, collaboration process capabilities); and digital business tendencies (e.g., digital business viability, digital business convergence, digital ethics);\n\n3. Digital business model innovation: shifts in digital business model configurations (e.g., financial and investment, stakeholder interconnections and relations, operational/production processes, input/output strategies, resource configuration and orchestration); digital tools (e.g., digital artifacts, platforms, and infrastructure); risks associated with innovative business models (e.g., relational and performance risks); digital innovation models’ validation and assessment; and shortcomings in digital business models (e.g., task division, task allocation, reward distribution); and\n\n4. Digital business affordances: intermediary role (e.g., connection between digital capacities and digital strategy development, interrelation between digital intensity and organizational performance, linkages between technical devices and marketing); enhancing role (e.g., support and development of competitive advantages, support in overcoming market barriers, support of market performance and market development, cost savings); and social influence (e.g., spillover effect).",

      "content": "The categories that relate to the Ecosystem dimension are grouped into three initial nodes (see Table 1): processes within the ecosystem, facilitating conditions for digital entrepreneurship, and social networks [60,72,96,99,100,102–105,108,109].\n\nResearchers claim that digital innovations go beyond company-level boundaries and require the formation of a digital ecosystem. Such an ecosystem becomes an accelerator for creating digital start-ups [101] and an environment that matches “digital artifacts” and digital users and agents, as well as providing digital governance, business management, and other affordances [107]. Particularly, the peculiarities of incubation processes within the ecosystem may affect the dynamics of digital entrepreneurship [103]. The broadest notion that describes the influence of the ecosystem is related to the context of digital entrepreneurship with different dimensions that enhance or constrain the development of such activity (e.g., temporal, historical, spatial, institutional, social, industry, organizational) [104]. As also stated previously, context dimensions affect the scale to which entrepreneurs may use digital competences [104] that, on the individual level, become the key determinants of the digital entrepreneurship ecosystem [101].\n\nGiven individual behavior, another influencing dimension is the online context that affects the broadening of social networks and, as a result, facilitates the acquisition of social capital through the development of structural connections between individuals, as well as the bridging of structural holes [105]. Such a network approach is directly interrelated with regional ICT access and entrepreneurship performance as it may become a facilitator in the conditions of resource constraints and institutional barriers [108]. This supports the proposition that digitalization helps to overcome institutional and sociocultural restrictions [60]. However, the ecosystem itself provides the supporting conditions for digital entrepreneurship. Particularly, several researchers claim the important role of cities as they provide possibilities for a sharing economy that allows overcoming institutional barriers and accomplishing institutional changes [109]. As well, business incubation facilities provide information assistance to new ventures [102], and Living Labs are tools for understanding the digital-entrepreneurship process from the idea creation stage to the start-up and business-management stage [100]. Digitalization also enhances the transformation in stakeholder interaction patterns and, consequently, new approaches for competing in digital ecosystems [96,106].\n\nThe analysis of the initial nodes and the understanding of the interactions between the relevant categories allow us to define three determinants of digital entrepreneurship within the Ecosystem dimension:\n\n1. Regional digital business environment: resource availability/constraints (including regional ICT\naccess); digital entrepreneurship attitudes (e.g., perception and resistance); and context effect on digital\nstart-up formation (e.g., spatial and temporal influence, social, political, institutional, and legislative factors); 2. Digital business infrastructure: digital cluster framework (e.g., absorptive capacity, benefits for\nmembers, economic performance, influential factors, mobilizability capacity); facilitating conditions\nwithin the infrastructure (e.g., support of innovations by the digital ecosystem, incubation facilities,\n\ninformation technology assistance); and digital infrastructure architecture (e.g., heterogeneity of digital infrastructure, digital infrastructure governance, information flows); and\n\n3. Collaboration and social values: system of relationships (e.g., interconnections between agents, contact points, channels of partner relations, agents and users roles, knowledge orchestration and distribution) and community and network patterns (e.g., activity within the network, actor ties, resource and module networks, acquisition of social capital, structural holes effect).\n\nTable 2 provides a summarized overview of the defined determinants of digital entrepreneurship.\n\nTable 2.

Such content-related issues also require extended empirical research [19,110,122,123].

The comprehensive systematic literature review, which was conducted based on a PRISMA framework, allowed us to extract the core categories, form the initial nodes of digital entrepreneurship, and analyze their interactions as well as interconnections with other elements of the innovation system. In particular, these nodes helped to identify the determinants of digital entrepreneurship in three dimensions (i.e., entrepreneur, entrepreneurial process, and ecosystem), which cover a broad scope of elements from mentality patterns, personal characteristics, and outcomes to the organizational management process, and the influence of external infrastructure and institutions. The analysis helped us to identify the peculiarities of digital entrepreneurship in relation to traditional business mechanisms.\n\nThe results call for further research in three specific directions: (1) empirical research on the impact of digitalization on the socioeconomic system; (2) an analysis of vulnerabilities in specific socioeconomic systems brought about by digitalization; and (3) an extension of transdisciplinary and system science approaches in management. Extended, consistent research may contribute to the overall understanding of the transformation processes that take place in modern socioeconomic systems and define their interconnectedness with global challenges and problems. An additional implication includes the understanding of how the resilience and sustainability of the socioeconomic system and its interrelated dimensions may be affected by disturbances and vulnerability factors resulting from social transformations. With respect to innovation systems, the results presented in this paper suggest the application of a systems science approach in order to understand how the particular dimensions of the innovation system are interrelated. This includes the capture of potential vulnerabilities related to entrepreneurs and stakeholders and the understanding of how the resilience and sustainability of the innovation system may be influenced by internal as well as external disturbances. In an attempt to gain deeper knowledge of digital entrepreneurship as part of the innovation system, a comparative study approach across not only geographic but also functional boundaries might also be useful. Beyond the organizational context, policy implications regarding the establishment of a supporting ecosystem are crucial.\n\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, L.S. and G.S.; methodology, L.S. and G.S.; validation, L.S.; formal analysis, L.S.; investigation, L.S.; writing—original draft preparation, L.S.; writing—review and editing, L.S. and G.S.; visualization, L.S.; supervision, G.S.
