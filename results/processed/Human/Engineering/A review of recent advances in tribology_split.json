This review takes stock of the recent advances in research pertaining to different aspects of tribology within the last 2 to 3 years. Different aspects of tribology that have been reviewed including lubrication, wear and surface engineering, biotribology, high temperature tribology, and computational tribology. This review attempts to highlight recent research and also presents future outlook pertaining to these aspects. It may however be noted that there are limitations of this review. One of the most important of these is that tribology being a highly multidisciplinary field, the research results are widely spread across various disciplines and there can be omissions because of this. Secondly, the topics dealt with in the field of tribology include only some of the salient topics (such as lubrication, wear, surface engineering, biotribology, high temperature tribology, and computational tribology) but there are many more aspects of tribology that have not been covered in this review. Despite these limitations it is hoped that such a review will bring the most recent salient research in focus and will be beneficial for the growing community of tribology researchers.",

As a result, publications on experimental and theoretical research work have increased enormously in a variety of academic journals, covering phyisics, chemistry, surface science, nanotechnology, materials science and engineering, biomedical engineering, as well as mechanical and manufacturing engineering. To provide a survey on the advances in tribology research, this review paper highlights the development in lubrication, wear, surface engineering, biotribolgy, high temperature tribology, and computational tribology, based on the journal papers published in the period of 2018−2019. For the intersectional publications, the authors discussed them in either one or two categories with compromise. Due to space limitation, it has not been possible to cover all the publications in this review and undoubtedly there have been some omissions. Despite best attempts, this review paper is extraordinarily long and each of its sections has focused on a particular topic. The readers may therefore read the parts they are most interested in as it may be hard to read the entire review from the beginning to the end.",

      "content": "DLC, one of the most exceptional solid lubricants [1, 2], is still attracting intensive research attention in the tribology community. Major achievements in the superlubricity of DLC film have been on two aspects, namely DLC-based emerging lubricants and DLC-related lubricity mechanisms.\n\nOwing to the researchers’ concerted efforts, several new kinds of DLC-based lubricants have emerged over the year. As a common concern, all these studies shed light on the bonding states and arrangement of $\\mathsf { s p } ^ { 2 } / \\mathsf { s p } ^ { 3 } .$ -phases. For instance, as shown in Fig. 1,\n\nArgibay et al. [3] found that a self-lubricating DLC nanocomposite film was in situ tribochemically formed from the ambient hydrocarbons of alcohols and alkanes on the nanocrystalline Pt−Au alloy surface. These films were extremely wear-resistant and underwent no obvious material removal even after 100,000 sliding cycles at a contact pressure of 1.1 GPa. Similarly, Wang et al. [4] developed a multi-phase carbonaceous coating containing amorphous, fullerene-like, and nano-crystalline carbons using magnetron sputtering method, which exhibited an ultralow friction coefficient of 0.05 and a low wear rate of about $1 0 ^ { - 8 } \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 } { \\cdot } \\mathrm { N } ^ { - 1 } { \\cdot } \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 }$ Another research group synthesized graphite-like carbon (GLC) and fullerene-like carbon (FLC) films by different heating and cooling processes after plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) [5]. Both of them were capable of bearing quite high normal loads and lowering the friction to a superlubricity state at higher contact pressure. Besides pure FLC, Wang et al. [6] designed a fluorine-containing FLC (F–FLC) film, for which the bonding structure could be tailored from fullerene-like to amorphous. Another interesting lubrication system is the combination of nanostructured DLC with ionic liquid (IL) toward low friction and anti-wear interfacial behaviors for special applications [7, 8].\n\nWith the strides in characterization techniques and simulation methods, researchers are now able to explore the lubricity mechanisms of DLC in a more elaborate way, especially the possibility to probe the sliding interface and tribo-induced products at atomic scale or even in real-time observations. All these works highlighted the critical role of tribo-induced structural changes and the in situ formed tribolayers in establishing a low-friction lubricity state. Chen et al.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 1 (a) Wear-resistant $\\mathrm { P t } { - } \\mathbf { A } \\mathbf { u }$ alloy surface lubricated from ambient trace hydrocarbons in dry $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ , (b) the in situ tribochemically formed self-lubricating DLC/Pt−Au nanocomposite film. Reproduced with permission from Ref. [3]. $©$ Elsevier, 2018.\n\n[9] proposed the combination of focused ion beam (FIB) slicing method with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) to detect the carbonaceous sliding interface. Their results demonstrated that this stateof-the-art technique could provide ultra-high imaging resolution and confirmed the dominating influence of tribo-induced interfacial nanostructures in governing the superlubricity for hydrogen-rich DLC films in dry sliding contact, as shown in Fig. 2.\n\nAmong the influencing factors, normal load (contact pressure), sliding velocity, temperature, and the surrounding atmosphere are playing pivotal roles in affecting the tribological performance [10]. Evidence has been collected to confirm that $\\mathsf { s p } ^ { 2 }$ -rich (FLC and GLC) [5, 11] or hydrogenated DLC [12] could withstand very high contact pressure (up to $1 . 2 4 \\mathrm { G P a } )$ by reconstructing the interfacial $\\mathsf { s p } ^ { 2 }$ -layered structures into graphene or the formation of graphitic shells or by the stress-triggered local transformation. Liu et al. [13] investigated the velocity dependence of superlubricity stability in a wide range of $3 – 7 0 \\ c m { \\cdot } s ^ { - 1 }$ and found that the failure of superlubricity at high sliding velocity was due to the absence of tribolayer on contact surface rather than the flashing heat effect or the destruction of hydrogen passivation. Experimental and theoretical calculation results verified the decisive roles of fluorine and silicon in stabilizing the bonding network of the bulk film and the as-formed tribolayer by forming F–C and Si–C bonds [14, 15]. For adhesive tribocouple of DLC against alumina, a volcano-type temperature dependence (300−1,000 K) of friction was clarified from the viewpoint of tribochemical reactions [16]. The increase of friction in the range of $6 0 0 { - } 8 0 0 \\mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ was attributed to the formation of ${ \\mathrm { C } } { \\mathrm { - } } { \\mathrm { O } }$ and $\\mathrm { C } { \\mathrm { - } } \\mathrm { A l }$ bonds along the sliding interface, and the subsequent decrease at $8 0 0 { - } 1 , 0 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { K }$ originated from the graphitization of DLC. As regards the ambient gaseous effects, a new set of data broadened low friction application of DLC to the carbon dioxide atmosphere through forming lactone-terminated surfaces [17]. Furthermore, Shi et al. [18] conducted comprehensive DFT calculations and demonstrated the effects of terminal states on friction behaviors of DLC in various gaseous environments. Meanwhile, they brought forward another possible strategy for hydrogenated DLC to realize superlow friction by electron lubrication. Another striking phenomenon encountered in amorphous carbon nitride film is the self-healing of lubricity state by mechanically induced material inflation [19], in which the ${ \\mathrm { C - N } }$ bond breaking assisted the release of cross-linkages between ${ \\mathsf { s p } } ^ { 2 }$ -sites and $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ desorption from the film surface. For in situ analysis of the lubricity mechanisms, Nevshupa et al. [20] improved the mechanically stimulated gas emission (MSGE) method with much higher accuracy to detect the emitted gas species from the hydrogenated DLC and confirmed that the major emitted gases were composed of C1−C3 alkanes, of which the tribo-emission rate increased with the hydrogen and methyl terminal group concentrations. To monitor the tribo-reactions in real time, a MEMS holder developed by Sato et al. [21] enabled in situ observation of the rolling and slipping events of DLC wear nanoparticles during lateral sliding. The DLC surface underwent permanent deformation at the nanoscale when subjected to forces as small as tens of nano-Newtons. Recently, Kuwahara et al. [22] using sliding experiments of ta-C/ta-C tribopairs showed that superlubricity with negligible wear can be achieved by lubrication with unsaturated fatty acids or glycerol. Zhang et al. [23] using high-intensity pulsed ion beam irradiated WC–Ni surface against graphite under water lubrication also got significant friction reduction.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 2 (a) BF-STEM image showing a tribolayer with thickness of ${ \\sim } 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ in situ grown on the ball surface for self-mated a-C:H:Si $( 9 . 3 \\ \\mathrm { a t \\% } $ Si) films after superlubricity test in dry $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } ,$ and $( \\mathsf { b } \\mathrm { - } \\mathsf { d } )$ its nanostructure revealed by BF-, HAADF-, false-colored BF-STEM and IFFT (or FFT) images.

      "level": 1,
      "content": "Due to their weak interlayer interaction, graphite, graphene, carbon nanotubes, and other 2D materials have been reported to offer potential opportunities to achieve superlubricity [24−29]. Up to now, superlubricity has been achieved in various material systems at different length scales, revealing a series of new physical mechanisms. Following is a brief introduction of the recent advances in this complex area.\n\nIt has been theoretically proposed that heterostructures composed of 2D layers with lattice mismatch and intrinsic incommensurate interfacial geometry provide a perfect model system to achieve robust superlubricity [30, 31]. Although theoretically sound, it has been challenging to verify this mechanism experimentally, due to the fact that it is difficult to perform sliding friction tests between 2D layers. Recently, a thermally assisted mechanical exfoliation and transfer (TAMET) method has been proposed to achieve superlubricity between 2D heterostructures with friction coefficient down to the $1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ level [32], where various 2D flake-wrapped AFM tips were fabricated to directly measure the interlayer friction between 2D flakes in single-crystalline contact, as shown in Fig. 3. Also the interlayer coupling between twisted $\\mathrm { M o S } _ { 2 }$ layers has been detected by using the low-frequency Raman spectroscopy, which is a reflection of interlayer shear mode and force constants [33]. Researchers have also made arduous attempts, such as AFM-based nanomanipulation experiments of gold nanoparticles sliding on HOPG [34], and the superlubricity sliding of monolayer tungsten disulfide $( \\mathsf { W } S _ { 2 } )$ on epitaxial graphene grown on silicon carbon [35].\n\nBesides the superlubricity mechanism due to incommensurate interfacial geometry within the atomically small contacts, some theoretical studies have been performed to understand new mechanisms of superlubricity. Sadeghi [36] found that superlubricity could be controlled by the multiatomic nature of nanocontacts. In this context, an increase in the layer size or the interlayer couplings could enhance the multiatomic nature and result in the reduction of friction. On the other hand, superlubricity can be achieved by pressure-induced friction collapse based on the firstprinciples calculations. Sun et al. [37] demonstrated that abnormal load dependence of atomic-scale friction in a graphene/graphene system, where the sliding friction initially increased and then decreased with increasing normal load until collapsed to a frictionless regime at a critical point. This is attributed to the transition of the sliding potential energy surface from corrugated, to substantially flattened, and eventually to counter-corrugated states.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 3 (a) Friction between graphite flake-wrapped tip and h-BN substrate.

[32]. $©$ American Chemical Society, 2018.\n\nBesides the experimental demonstration of nanoscale structural superlubricity [25], observation of frictionless sliding in microscale and macroscale contacts has also been reported, such as self-retraction behavior in graphite mesas and intershell sliding in multiwalled carbon nanotubes [38, 39]. Recently, microscale superlubricity has been obtained at heterogeneous interface between multilayer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride in Luo’s [40] group by using a graphenecoated microsphere (GMS) probe, as shown in Fig. 4(a). This ultralow friction was attributed to the sustainable overall incommensurability due to the multi-asperity contact covered with randomly oriented graphene nanograins. Microscale superlubricity of heterojunctions between graphite and mica [41], graphite and hexagonal boron nitride [42] was also obtained based on the self-retraction behavior of graphite mesas.\n\nMacroscopic superlubricity has been observed between diamond-like carbon films and nanoscrolls formed from graphene flakes and nanodiamond particles [43]. The same group recently demonstrated that ultra-low friction also occurs between onion-like carbon structures (OLCs) and the hydrogenated diamond-like carbon (H-DLC) surface, as shown in Fig. 5 [44]. Nanodiamonds would form OLCs catalyzed by molybdenum atoms from molybdenum disulfide. In another study, OLC films were prepared by constant current high-frequency dual-pulsed enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique, where super-low friction and wear rate were achieved due to an effect of “molecular bearing” in the friction process [45].\n\n[Image]\nFig. 4 (a) Friction between graphene-coated microsphere tip and h-BN substrate.

Reproduced with permission from Ref. [44]. $©$ Springer Nature, 2018.\n\nThe microscale superlubricity of graphite can be achieved with a friction coefficient of 0.0003 by the formation of multiple transferred graphene nanoflakes through tribointeractions [46], and the superlubricity of graphite sliding against graphene nanoflake can also be achieved under ultrahigh contact pressure of up to $2 . 5 2 \\mathrm { G P a }$ [47].\n\nIn 2019, there are some new works on superlubricity of 2D materials with their thickness down to few atomic layers, which show intrinsic advantages, such as atomically smooth, chemically inert, and weak interlayer van der Waals interaction, including theoretical models and experimental explorations [48, 49]. Li et al. [50] showed that the critical adhesion forces between BN and graphite, and ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 }$ and graphite were respectively 0.953 and 1.028 times than that between graphite and graphite, which were consistent with the prediction based on Lifshitz theory.

The chemical reaction film and adsorption film on the worn surface provided low shear stresses and reduced friction. Based on the above analysis, a superlubricity model for the formation of adsorption film by friction induced chemical reaction is proposed by Ge et al. [72]. Recently, Xiao et al.

Therefore, finding ways to realize superlubricity in thin film lubrication become a great challenge for tribologists. Luo’s group successfully reduced the friction coefficient and achieved the superlubricity state under thin film lubrication conditions in 2018 [78].\n\nIn their work, the steel surfaces of the friction pair was lubricated with PEG aqueous solution in the running-in process, then changed to polarity lubricant (PAG) and non-polar lubricant (PAO), respectively. It is found that a very low friction coefficient (about 0.005) can be obtained directly, as shown in Figs. 8(a) and 8(b). Through the analysis of the worn surface, it is found that there is a layer of friction induced chemical reaction film on the steel surface after PEG running-in treatment, and the reaction film still exists after PAG (or PAO) lubrication test. The superlubricity is attributed to the interaction of chemical reaction layer, adsorption layer, and fluid layer. In addition, they also realized macroscopic superlubricity state between steel/steel surfaces by using 1,3-diketone (EPBD-02/01) with a friction coefficient of 0.006, as shown in Fig. 8(c) [79].",

Due to its high thermal stability and promising tribological properties, the application of ILs as boundary lubricants is becoming more and more interesting. Dašić et al. [81] have studied the influence of limiting factors on the lubrication and flow characteristics of ionic liquid by molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that in the dynamic state, the interaction between the IL molecules and the solid wall is the main driving force to control the molecular behavior of ionic liquids in the gap. The transition from a dense liquid to an ordered and possibly solidified ionic liquid is also observed under variable normal loading and shear. More and more work shows that water affects the structure and properties of ionic liquids near solid surfaces. Zhang et al. [82] studied how water affects the three-dimensional structure of the ionic liquid [BMIM] [Tf2N] near the surface of mica with two different charge densities. They found that water can not only change the ion layer near the mica surface, but also change their lateral orientation order and the aggregation of the cationic hydrophobic tail. Freita et al. [83] investigated properties of the bulk phase of the surfactant-like amphiphilic ionic liquid [C10C1Pyrr] [NTf2] and of that in the confined space as well as that on the mica interface by using molecular dynamics. The bicontinuous structure in the bulk phase and the ordered monolayer and bilayer structures spontaneously formed in the confined space are well explained.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 9 (a) The stable superlubricity state with a friction coefficient of 0.005 was achieved by using KCl solution between the silicon nitride ball and the sapphire surface, (b) comparison of $\\mathrm { S i } 2 \\mathsf { p }$ peak of XPS on silicon nitride surface after running-in by different solutions. Reproduced with permission from Ref. [80]. $©$ American Chemical Soeity, 2018.\n\nKhatri et al. [84] found that with the increase of alkyl chains of the fatty acid ionic liquids, the wear resistance and friction reduction properties of the liquids were improved. The results of Shi et al. [85] show that only the ionic liquid C6MIMBF4 with the long alkyl chain can obtain stable ionic liquids-based magnetic nanofluids which can be used as lubricant. An et al. [86] found that the ionic liquid, glycol ether mixtures, at titanium interfaces had a negative friction load dependence, i.e., the friction force decreased with the increase of normal load. Han et al. [87] discussed the activated slip and flow of ionic liquid lubricating molecules.\n\nZheng et al. [88] using acid-based ionic liquids as additives in glycerol solution improved the anticorrosion and lubrication ability of glycerol solution. Li et al. [89] has studied the synergistic effect of several proton ILs and an organic friction modifier (OFM) to achieve lower friction. Gong et al. [90] and Lhermerout et al. [91] discussed the new progress in ionic liquids. Jiang et al. [92] reported environmentally friendly ILs ([Ch][AA] ILs) derived from amino acids (AAs) and choline (Ch) synthesized by using biomaterials through a simple, green route. Their results indicated that these ILs exhibit good frictionreducing and anti-wear properties as lubricants for steel/steel contact, which is related to the formation of a physically adsorbed film on the metal surface during friction. Amann et al. [93] also reported the use of ILs as anti-wear additives. Li et al. [94] synthesized several ILs in situ with monovalent metal salts and ethylene glycol (EG) by tribochemical reactions and realized macroscale superlubricity for all ILs at silicon nitride $( \\mathrm { S i } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { N } _ { 4 } )$ interfaces. The combination of composite tribochemical layer (comprised of phosphates, fluorides, silica $\\left( \\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 } \\right)$ , and ammonia-containing compounds), hydration layer, and fluid film contributed to the superlubricity and wear protection, as shown in Fig. 10.

Pure water as a lubricant has been studied by more and more researchers.\n\nThe tribological properties of NaCl aqueous solution on Au (111) surface have been investigated by Pashazanusi et al. [96] using AFM. It is found that when a positive potential is applied to the Au surface, a finite height and ordered ice-like water structure is formed at the interface, and a hydrogen bond is formed between the AFM tip and the film, which makes the friction coefficient very large. When negative potential is applied to the surface of $\\mathsf { A u } ,$ the structure of ice-like water is destroyed, and water acts as lubricant at the interface. The friction force is low or even lower than the open circuit potential. Wu et al. [97] have investigated the influence of the bionic nonsmooth surface on glass fiber-epoxy resin composite under natural seawater lubrication. Their results show that the lubrication performance of dimpled sample is much better than that of the smooth sample under all rotational speeds and the friction reduction is approximately $4 3 . 2 9 \\%$ of smooth surface.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 10 Proposed superlubricity and antiwear model.

By adding amphoteric ion solution, a sub-nano-hydrated layer was formed between graphene and amphoteric ions, and a very low friction coefficient of 0.001 was achieved. Li et al. [99] also studied the nanoscale self-assembled fluorinated surfactant micelle array by AFM. It was found that the micelle array would be crushed to form monolayer adsorption molecules under certain pressure, and the friction coefficient was different between the two cases.\n\nArif et al. [100] has investigated the effect of water intercalation on the friction behavior between graphene layers and graphene oxide (GO) layers by FFM. They found that when the interlayer adsorbed water molecules change from “ice water” into “liquid water” structure, the friction decreases. Weber et al. [101] investigated the friction properties and mechanism of ice at a temperature of $- 1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . The results showed that the friction coefficient at the low temperature $\\left( - 1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } \\right)$ was very high, however the friction coefficient decreased sharply with the increase of temperature. The high mobility of mobile ice molecules and weak hydrogen bonds of molecules on the solid surface leads to easier shear, which leads to the low friction coefficient.",

[102] investigated the lubrication property of oil in the cylinder liner-piston ring (CLPR) and their work indicated that the micro-concave is more favorable for improving the wear performances at the high load. The results of Zhao et al. [103] showed that the viscosity and low-temperature fluidity of the base liquid can be significantly improved by adding polymethacrylates under the condition of boundary lubrication, polymethacrylate modified lubricant exhibits better antifriction performance in a wide range of temperature and load.\n\nThe simulation works of Wang et al. [104] showed that the antiwear agent molecules with super-antiwear properties should have a structure which can be adsorbed on the metal surface stably and preferably through chemisorption. At the same time, some groups in its structure can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which can enhance the intermolecular force. Shi et al. [105] studied the tribological properties of polycarboxylic acid containing benzene ring plane molecules. It is found that the surface with higher friction coefficient has larger total surface energy.\n\nIn the research area of lubrication mechanism, Liang et al. [106] used relative optic interference intensities (ROII) [100] technique to measure the film thickness and study the behavior of thin film lubrication (TFL) formed by spontaneous recombination of oil at high speed. The results showed that in the oil starvation condition, lubricant molecules rearrange to form an ordered layer and a thicker critical film. Wang et al. [107] by using the relative light intensity method [76], obtained the thickness maps of the grease-lubricated films from the interferometer images captured by the two microscopes. Their test results revealed that the grease thickener’s formulation had remarkable effects on film formation and the perturbation of film thickness.\n\nThe TFL molecular model proposed in 1996 had not been validated experimentally so far. However, there has been a major breakthrough in 2019 [108, 109]. Gao et al. [108] developed a method based on surfaceenhanced Raman spectroscopy which can show both the packing and orientation of liquid molecules in the TFL regime as shown in Fig. 11. Their results indicate that the orientation of liquid molecules in central region of the gap is guided by the shear direction [109] and that of polar molecules near the solid surface $( \\operatorname { A g } )$ is guided by solid material [108]. The TFL model with a nanosandwich structure consisting of an adsorbed layer, an ordered-molecule layer, and a fluid layer has been verified.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 11 Raman relative intensity graphs of 6CB on different substrates under shearing.

[110] observed that on the graphite surface, the confined molecules are parallel to the surface orientation of all liquids, resulting in a layer with the thickness equivalent to the diameter of the alkyl chain. The confined cetane molecules on the surface of mica are also parallel to the surface, while the molecules in the first layer of 1-hexadecene and PAO take a more upright direction. The results of Okubo et al. [111] showed that the amorphous carbon/fatty acid interface is a thick boundary film with high molecular density, which can support sliding surface to reduce friction. Zeng et al. [112] found that the ultra-low friction in castor oil lubrication can be attributed to its degradation and oxidation induced by friction, and the repulsive force between the OH– end and solid surface. Ta et al. [113] has studied the influence of molecular structure on lubrication of aqueous triblock copolymer lubricants between rutile surfaces using molecular dynamics simulation. The shear force has a slight effect on the orientation of the molecules. Ewen et al. [114] studied the nanoscale behavior of lubricant under shear using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations (NEMD). The research progress of non-equilibrium molecular dynamics of lubricants and additives and the future prospects of NEMD in tribology are also discussed. Xu et al. [115] studied the cyclohexane film on the mica surface by using molecular dynamics, and found the repulsive force between the two solid surfaces starts at about seven lubricant layers $( n = 7 )$ , and the lubricant film undergoes a sudden liquid-to-solid phase change at $n < 6$ .",

The two-dimensional materials mainly include graphene [116], boron nitride [117], ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 }$ [118], and other 2D materials [119–121]. The other materials concentrate on metallic or nonmetallic nanoparticles [122, 123], metallic or nonmetallic oxides [124, 125], and inorganic nanocomposites [126]. Therefore, this section is divided into two parts, namely two-dimensional materials and other dimensional materials.\n\n2D Materials, as a shining star in various fields, also possess excellent anti-friction properties because of the enhanced film formation [127, 128], the self-healing or mending effects [129], and the ball bearing effect [130]. The liquid lubrication with additives of graphene class materials attracted a lot of attention recently. For instance, a robust macroscale superlubricity state $\\langle \\mu = 0 . 0 0 3 7 \\rangle$ , by taking advantage of the synergy effect of graphene oxide (GO) nanoflakes and ethanediol between the surfaces of $\\mathrm { S i } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { N } _ { 4 }$ and $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ was reported [131]. Chemically-modified GO in hydrophobic ionic liquids [132], 4-n-pentyl- $\\cdot 4 ^ { \\prime }$ -cyanobiphyl liquid crystal (5CB) added with graphene [128], graphene sheets anchored with molybdenum disulfide $( \\mathrm { M o } { \\cal S } _ { 2 } )$ nanoflowers [133], ILs with graphene [134, 135], chemicallybonded phosphorus-graphene hybrid [136], alkyl phosphate modified graphene oxide [137], and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) grafted graphene oxide [138], were synthesized and used as liquid lubricants or additives. The research on transition metal disulfides (TMDs) liquid additives, especially ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 } ,$ mainly focused on the preparation of functional ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 }$ nanosheets [118, 139], ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 }$ nanotubes [140, 141], hollow fullerene-like ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 }$ [142], $\\mathrm { F e } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 4 } @ \\mathrm { M o S } _ { 2 }$ core-shell nanocomposites [143], and $\\mathrm { M o S } _ { 2 }$ /montmorillonite nanocomposites [144], etc. A new 2D-layered material, black phosphorus (BP), has been used as liquid lubricant additives recently [119]. Wang et al. [145] utilized black phosphorus (BP) as an excellent water-based lubricant additive and significantly reduced friction and achieved superlubricity $( \\mu = 0 . 0 0 0 6 )$ in ball-on-plate tribometer. The conditions for achieving superlubricity are relaxed, including a wide range of additive concentrations, contact pressures, and sliding velocities. The extremely low shear resistance of the water layer retained by the ultrafine BP nanosheets modified by NaOH is responsible for an excellent tribology property, as shown in Fig. 12 [145]. Wu et al. [146] demonstrated that degradation of BP nanosheets favored the lubrication properties, as shown in Fig. 13. Specifically, the friction force could reduce by about $5 0 \\%$ at the degraded area of the BP nanosheets due to the phosphorus oxides formed after degradation. Although to a lesser extent than graphene and ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 } ,$ other 2D materials, such as boron nitride, h-BN [147, 148], $\\mathrm { M g / A l }$ layered double hydroxides (LDHs) [149], $\\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } / \\mathrm { T i } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { C } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { T } _ { x }$ hybrid nanocomposites [150], have also been investigated as liquid lubricant additives.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 12 Superlubricity in the aqueous solution with BP-OH nanosheets. Reproduced with permission from Ref. [145]. $©$ American Chemical Soeity, 2018.\n\nRecently, more and more 2D materials have been studied as lubricant additives. Tang et al. [151] reported layered $\\mathbf { M o O } _ { 3 }$ as a lubricant additive exhibits good anti-friction and anti-wear properties. It is also found that the smaller the size of $\\mathbf { M o O } _ { 3 }$ layer, the better the friction-reducing effect. Liu et al. [152] fabricated the composite nanosheets of graphene and boron nitride using high-energy ball milling in ammonia gas and investigated its anti-wear properties as a lubricant additive in mineral base oil. Their experimental results showed that the stronger interaction between graphene and BN nanosheets exhibit better wear resistance and friction reduction properties. Ba et al. [153] reported that the layered double hydroxide/graphene nanosheets and layered double hydroxide/molybdenum disulfide were successfully prepared by electrostatic self-assembly. The composite nanoparticles have good dispersion stability in the base oil. At the same time, the nanocomposites significantly improve the lubricating properties of the base oil due to the synergistic lubrication between LDH and GO or ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 }$ . Chen et al. [154] successfully prepared a synthetic oil-soluble ultra-thin ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 }$ sheet as lubricant additive and investigated the wear behavior under about 1 GPa pressure. Because of the uniform dispersion of molybdenum disulfide, wear can be controlled as long as the actual pressure is less than the fracture strength of ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 }$ .\n\nThere are a number of promising nanoparticles as lubricant additives for friction and wear reduction because they can intensely interact with substrates and exhibit potential to form protective tribofilms on the surfaces of rubbing materials [140, 155−158]. Borda et al. [159] investigated the influence of copper nanoparticle additives on the tribological performance of mineral and synthetic ester base oils using a tribometer with pin-on-disk and four-ball configuration. Their results indicated that the copper nanoparticles improved the tribological properties of mineral oil whereas it is disadvantageous for use in synthetic polar oil. Wang et al. [160] successfully prepared the novel carbon nanoparticles co-doped with sulfur and nitrogen from rice husk powder by hydrothermal reaction. As a lubricating additive for polyethylene glycol (PEG200) base oil, the friction film containing sulfide and metal oxide have excellent lubricating properties under different loads. Lu et al. [161] demonstrated that ${ \\sf W S } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ composite nanoparticles have a great influence on the tribological properties of diisooctyl sebacate (DIOS). Composite nanoparticles significantly improve the wear resistance of DIOS. Compared with pure DIOS, the wear amount is reduced by about $8 1 \\%$ . Kumara et al. [162] reported that adding $0 . 5 { - } 1 . 0 ~ \\ \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ dodecanethiol-modified palladium nanoparticles to a lubricating oil leads to a significant reductions in friction and wear by up to $4 0 \\%$ and $9 7 \\%$ , respectively, and the formation of unexpected 10 times thicker $( 2 { - } 3 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ tribofilm in boundary lubrication. Further investigation suggested that such an ultrathick tribofilm dominated by $\\mathrm { P d } / \\mathrm { S }$ compounds is responsible for the superior lubricating behavior, as shown in Fig. 14. Zhao et al. [163] prepared water-soluble Cu nanoparticles of size approximately $3 \\mathrm { n m }$ at room temperature via in-situ surface modification. The tribological behavior of such Cu nanoparticles as an additive in distilled water can significantly improve the tribological properties of distilled water and the lowest friction coefficient of 0.06 was obtained via lubrication with a concentration of $0 . 6 ~ \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ of ${ \\mathrm { c u } }$ nanoparticles in distilled water, which is a reduction of $8 0 . 6 \\%$ compared with that obtained via lubrication with distilled water alone.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 13 Degradation of BP nanosheets favored the lubrication properties.

Advances of researches on ionic liquid additives have been mentioned afore, and hence hydrogel and other organic additives will be addressed as below.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 14 The image and composition of the ultrathick tribofilm.

The use of hydrogels as biolubricant additives has recently been investigated extensively in biomaterial science research due to their nontoxicity and excellent anti-friction performance. Xu et al. [166] reported that the thermally responsive microgel is used as lubricant additive for aqueous solutions. The microgel rolls and slides between the frictional interfaces, exhibiting the temperature-dependent friction-reducing and anti-wear properties. Torres et al. [167] synthesized starch-based emulsion microgel particles with different starch (15 and $2 0 \\ \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ ) and oil contents $( 0 { - } 1 5 ~ \\mathrm { w t \\% } )$ and investigated their lubrication performance under physiological conditions using smooth hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane ball-on-disc tribological tests. The combined results of experiment and theoretical calculations suggested that the mechanism behind the improved lubrication property was the release of the emulsion droplets triggered by the synergy of enzyme and shear, as shown in Fig. 15.\n\nOther types of additives mainly include oil-miscible polymer compounds or materials, which are used extensively and perform well as viscosity index improvers and pour point depressants along with improvement of tribological properties [168–172]. Singh et al. [173] synthesized three copolymeric additives utilizing the C18 alkyl acrylate (C18Ac) and N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAA) monomers by varying the ratio between C18Ac:DMAA. All the synthesized polymers in polyol base oil revealed excellent performance in viscosity index improver, antiwear, antifriction, and anticorrosion. Xu et al. [174] demonstrated that molybdenum dialkyldithiocarbamate has excellent friction reduction properties in boundary lubrication, and the distribution of modified lubricating additives on the contact surface is closely related to tribological performance. Dubey et al. [175] reported that PTFE nanoparticles in suspension exhibit excellent extreme pressure properties through using polyisobutylene succinimide as a dispersant to improve the dispersion stability in oil.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 15 The lubrication performance of emulsion microgel particles under physiological conditions.

Van Ravensteijn et al. [179] prepared the (hybrid) star polymers carrying a silicate-based core and used it as additive in a commercial base oil (Yubase 4). The experiment results showed the single additive achieving all three functions—friction reduction, wear protection, and viscosity improvement. The enhanced performance is most likely dominant by attractive forces between the silicate cores and the metallic surfaces and the branched architectures of polymer which prohibit ordering of the additives in thin films under high-load conditions. Bai et al. [180] successfully integrated ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 }$ and polyamide as the solid lubricants materials by laser sintering. The friction coefficient and wear rate after the additive were used during the linear reciprocating motion are reduced by an order of magnitude.\n\nSeymour et al.’s experiment results [181] indicated hairy NPs with sufficiently long alkyl pendant groups could form clear, homogeneous dispersions in poly(alphaolefin) (PAO) at low and high temperatures, exhibiting significant reductions in both the coefficient of friction (up to $3 8 \\%$ ) and wear volume (up to $9 0 \\%$ for iron flat) compared with neat PAO. They utilized the combination of poly(lauryl methacrylate) brushgrafted silica nanoparticles (hairy NPs or HNP) and phosphonium-phosphate IL as a friction-reducing additive in polyalphaolefin (PAO) oil and the results showed the improved lubricating performance, as shown in Fig. 16 [182].",

Only in 2018, the number of frictionrelated coating papers exceeded 5,000, among which more DLC-related coatings were investigated. Some of the coatings associated with superlubricity have been introduced in the superlubricity section and are not covered in detail again. Here, several new advances in tribological-related coating technology are briefly introduced, such as oxide coating [183–186], metal coating [187, 188], composite coating [183, 185, 189, 190], ceramic coating [191, 192], and so on.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 16 The hairy NPs combined with IL as a friction-reducing additive in PAO.

[183, 189] designed and prepared carbon nanotubes reinforced $\\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ coatings, and found that a small content of CNTs could enhance the tribological properties of plasma sprayed ceramic coating remarkably, indirectly by influencing microstructure of coating and directly by tribo-effects of CNTs during tribotest, including structure strengthening, triboreorientation, tribo-protruding, tribo-film, and tribodefection as shown in Fig. 17.\n\nYang et al.

Liu et al. [186] discussed as to how to remove the oxide film from the surface of pure iron on nanoscale and found that the mechanical strength of the outer layer is much higher than that of the inner layer which is quite close to that of the pure iron substrate.\n\nKiran et al. [187] investigated the sliding wear characteristics of as-deposited and heat-treated electroless Ni−P coatings against AISI E52100 steel ball. Zhou et al. [188] investigated the self-loosening of threaded fasteners subjected to dynamic shear load with three kinds of typical coatings, PTFE, ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 } ,$ and TiN applied to bolts and nuts. Wang et al.

Wang et al. [191] presented the aqueous lubrication of tribopairs formed by PEEK and PI material sliding against $\\mathrm { S i } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { N } _ { 4 }$ ceramic. Their experimental results indicated that water as a lubricant for the $\\mathrm { P I } { - } \\mathrm { S i } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { N } _ { 4 }$ tribopairs effectively reduces both friction coefficients by $3 5 . 5 \\%$ and wear rates by $3 2 \\%$ which is due to dimples appearing on the PI tribopair surfaces under water which generated additional hydrodynamic lubrication and further improved the friction properties of surface. Datta et al. [192] have investigated mechanical, wear, corrosion, and biological properties of arc deposited titanium nitride coatings and showed that cathodic arc deposited TiN coatings can be achieved by minimizing/eliminating coating defects which accelerated the localized damage during articulation.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 17 Schematic illustration to reveal the CNTs induced wear mechanism for plasma sprayed ceramic coating: (1) structure strengthening, (2) tribo-protruding of CNTs, (3) tribo-reorientation of CNTs, (4) tribo-film of CNTs, and (5) tribo-defection of CNTs.

On the other hand, on-line monitoring of wear processes is becoming increasingly important and popular in industry for the purpose of conditionbased equipment maintenance.

      "content": "A lot of research and development have been devoted to high wear resistant alloys. Yi et al. [193] reported that addition of a small amount of ${ \\mathrm { c u } }$ and $\\mathrm { N i }$ into $\\scriptstyle { \\mathrm { F e - B - C r - C } }$ based alloy can change the ratio of volume fraction of martensite to pearlite, $V _ { \\mathrm { m } } / V _ { \\mathrm { p } } ,$ and with the increase in $V _ { \\mathrm { m } } / V _ { \\mathrm { p } }$ the abrasion resistance of the alloy increases at the normal load of $7 ~ \\mathrm { N }$ in pin-on-disk two-body abrasive wear test. At a higher load of $3 0 \\mathrm { N } ,$ however, the wear resistance decreases. They also found that the wear mechanism is different at different load conditions. At the low load, micro-cutting is dominant, while wear shifts to a mixed mode of micro-cutting and micro-ploughing when the load is high. Huang et al. [194] added (Ti, Mo)C particles to NM500 low alloy wear resistant steel to improve its abrasion resistance. They used dry sand rubber wheel abrasion wear test to compare the three-body abrasive wear resistance between NM500 steel and (Ti, Mo)Creinforced steel under applied loads of 45 and $^ { 1 3 0 \\mathrm { N } }$ . They reported that the wear resistance of the particlereinforced steel is 1.6 times that of NM500 at the heavy load of $^ { 1 3 0 \\mathrm { N } }$ and 1.8 times at the light load of $4 5 \\mathrm { N }$ . In Ref. [195], TiC particles were also added into $\\mathrm { R } Z 5 \\mathrm { M g }$ alloy to improve its mechanical strength and wear resistance. They used a self-propagating high temperature synthesis technique to make the composite and tested the reinforced $\\mathrm { M g }$ alloy by using a pin-on-disk tribometer under dry abrasive wear conditions. The effects of applied load, sliding distance, and TiC particle concentration on friction coefficient and weight loss of the composite were reported.\n\nOn the other hand, abrasive wear is widely utilized in polishing of precisionparts. Nguyen et al. [196] investigated the wear mechanism of abrasive polishing and slurry jet impact of reaction bonded SiC which is to be used for the construction of space optical devices and telescopes. They found that diamond abrasives polish the surface with brittle fractures of SiC phase while the silicon phase is mainly plastically deformed and embedded onto surface of the fractured SiC. When softer abrasives are supplied by slurry jet on the surface, wear takes place at lower pressure through weakening the Si bond by erosion and wedging. They concluded that the reaction bonded SiC can be polished without any surface damage by using lowpressure alumina slurry jet. Lin et al. [197] performed experiments of chemical mechanical polishing of silicon wafer and proposed a theoretical model for predictions of average abrasive removal depths and surface morphology. By taking the effect of chemical reaction of slurry into account, the proposed model gives reasonable simulation results which are in accordance with experimental ones.\n\nFor rolling contact components such as rolling element bearings, gears, and wheels, fatigue wear is a common failure mode. In hybrid ball bearings, made of steel raceways and silicon nitride balls, the rolling contact fatigue of silicon ball as well as steel raceways is critical for the lifetime of bearings. Kanematsu published a review article [198] on the testing methods and crack propagation analysis of silicon nitride. The Refs. [199] and [200] investigated experimentally the rolling contact fatigue of railway wheels. In Ref. [199], two kinds of wheel materials, CL60 and AAR-D, were tested on a small-scale rolling-sliding wear apparatus against a simulative rail made of U75V steel. They measured traction coefficient and wear rate as well as recorded surface damages during testing. It is found that wear rate changes with the increase of slip ratio in different ways, linear increase (slip ratio $< 6 \\%$ ), nonlinear increase $6 \\% <$ slip ratio $< ~ 1 8 \\%$ ), and undefined way (slip ratio $> 1 8 \\%$ ) where the two wheel materials show totally different tendency. By linking the wear debris and surface damage analyses, revealed the wear mechanisms transition from oxidative wear to fatigue wear and then back to oxidative wear with the increase in slip ratio. Faccoli et al. [200] investigated the effect of desert sand on wear and rolling contact fatigue of the railway wheels made of ER8, CLASS C, SANFLOS\\* S, and SANDLOS\\* H, respectively. They used a two-disc testing machine with a sand feeder to measure the weight loss against rolling cycles. Their results showed that the sanding accelerated the wear by a factor from 1.4 for SANDLOS\\* H discs to 2.2 for ER8 and CLASS C discs. They attributed the effect of sanding to the high plastic flow occurred underneath the contacting surface induced by the high local pressure due to the interposed sand particles between the two discs. FEA analysis was used to support their explanation. Spalling fatigue wear was also found in scrap shear blades made of NiCrVMo and CrB containing steels [201].\n\nFretting wear is another failure mode of materials, under which adhesion, oxidation, and fatigue of materials happen consequently or simultaneously. Dréano et al. [202] investigated the fretting wear of HS25 cobalt-based alloy at low-to-medium temperature conditions and established a tribo-oxidation abrasive wear model to predict the wear rate. The experiments were conducted on a cross-cylinder contact configuration with gross-slip. They found a high wear rate at the temperature condition due to lacking of formation of glaze layer during fretting, and the proposed model has a good correlation with the experimental observations. In Ref. [203], the fretting wear of Zircaloy-4 was studied. A unique test rig with four sets of prod-and-slider face-to-face contact was used for fretting tests, and the wear coefficients under different strokes were measured. Meanwhile, the surface topography of worn surface was characterized on a confocal laser microscope and a scanning electron microscope. Fractal analysis and FEM rough surface contact analysis were also performed to explain the experiment results. In Ref. [204], the fretting performance of $\\mathrm { M g { - } } S \\mathrm { n { - } } Y$ alloy was evaluated under fluids lubrication, and the fretting mechanism was explored in detail via analysis of wear track/debris using SEM and XPS depth profile. The results illustrated that the friction reduction was superior to wear resistance for lubricated Mg–Sn–Y/Steel contact under fretting conditions, mainly depending on the oil-film induced transformation of fretting running regime and transition of fretting wear (from adhesive/ oxidation wear and delamination under dry friction to abrasive wear and delamination under fluids lubrication). ZrN coating was applied to prevent fretting wear of a wheel/axle push fit joint in a rail vehicle [205]. Wear tests of a joint loaded with a vertical force were conducted on a fatigue testing machine permitting oscillatory tangential displacement, which is responsible for the development of fretting wear, and wear resistance of uncoated and coated shafts was compared. It was demonstrated that a significant mitigation of fretting wear could be achieved with the $\\mathrm { Z r N }$ coatings. The evolution of mechanical properties and microstructures of tribologically transformed structure (TTS) layers during fretting process were investigated using nanoindentation and focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM). A modified wear model that accounts for friction-induced dynamic changes in mechanical properties was proposed [206]. In Ref. [207], an experimental study was described on the fretting wear and frictional mechanism of interface between spiral wound gasket (SWG) and flange. The results showed that the gasket winding structure affects the variation of the friction coefficient fluctuation. To investigate the wear mechanism at the contact interface of the blade shroud in steam turbines, two base alloy steels were tested under different conditions: surface treatment (with and without laser quenching), temperature, and normal load on a fretting test-rig. Comparison of volume losses at room and low temperature showed that at $1 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ the volume losses decreased dramatically [208].\n\nPercussion wear, or impact wear in other words, occurs when a solid surface is impinged on repeatedly by other objects. If a large number of small particles impact on a surface continuously with high velocity, erosive wear appears. The Refs. [209] and [210] investigated impact wear and erosive wear respectively. In Ref. [209], a modified Archard adhesive wear equation was used to evaluate wear over impact, and an impact wear tester was used to validate the predictive model. While in Ref. [210], the effect of abrasive/material hardness ratio, $H _ { \\mathrm { a } } / H _ { \\mathrm { m } } ,$ on erosion wear was addressed. Solid particle erosion wear tests were performed with three types of abrasives and several different types of heat treatments and materials to obtain 11 different $H _ { \\mathrm { a } } / H _ { \\mathrm { m } }$ ratios. A moderate wear regime was observed when $H _ { \\mathrm { a } } K _ { \\mathrm { I C _ { \\mathrm { - } } a b r a s i v e } } / H _ { \\mathrm { m } }$ ratio (KIC_abrasive is the fracture toughness of the erodent material) is less than 2, while a moderate-severe transition regime was observed when the ratio is between 2 and 4. A $1 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ -thick ${ \\mathrm { Z r C } }$ ceramic coating with grain size of $6 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ was prepared on bare 316 stainless steel using double glow discharge sputter technique, and its cavitation erosion resistance was characterized by the combination of an ultrasonic vibration system with an electrochemical workstation [211]. The results showed that the volume loss of the ${ \\mathrm { Z r C } }$ nanoceramic coating was only $4 6 \\%$ of the 316 stainless steel after cavitation test, and erosion damage of the ${ \\cal Z } \\mathrm { r } { \\cal C }$ nanoceramic coating was significantly decreased as compared to the uncoated 316 stainless steel. In Ref. [212], two standardised solid particle erosion test rigs, ASTM C704 and GOST 23.201, usable for refractories with different working principles, were compared. Comparison tests showed similar results at shallow impact angle for materials featuring a slight difference in wear resistance between phases, while for materials containing sufficiently harder phases, the GOST produced lower wear rates.\n\nIn aerospace and internal combustion engines, machine elements suffer from high temperatures, which affects wear behavior of materials remarkably. In Ref. [213], two types of finger seal used in aeroengine were tested at cold (283 K) and hot (433 K) states. Leakage and wear were measured under different pressure ratios and rotating speeds (up to $5 , 0 0 0 \\mathrm { r p m } ,$ ). It is found that the finger seal with doublelaminate showed lower leakage at the cold state while the finger seal with triple-laminate performed better at the hot state. Wear of the finger seal at the hot state was more severe than that at the cold state. In Ref. [214], cast iron cylinder wear was experimentally investigated in a four-cylinder automotive internal combustion engine. Local wear of cylinder at the topdead-center (TDC) and bottom-dead-center (BDC) positions was compared under two test conditions, one was fueled with local gasoline and the other was fueled with ethanol. The test results showed that ethanol fuel resulted in the highest local wear at the BDC, which was caused by the three-body abrasion by carbon residuals and piston ring particles. Wang et al. [215] compared tribological behavior of $\\mathrm { T i } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { A l N }$ reinforced TiAl composite with TiAl alloy on a ballon-disk tester at temperatures ranging from room temperature to $8 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . They found that $\\mathrm { T i } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { A l N }$ reinforced TiAl showed lower friction and higher wear resistance than TiAl alloy at the test temperatures, and wear mechanism transformed from abrasive wear to adhesive wear along with the increase in temperature for the tested materials.\n\nIn metalworking processes, wear of tools is an important issue. For example, in direct press hardening, metal sheet is formed at high temperature (typically $7 0 0 \\mathrm { - } 7 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ with dies and then directly quenched. During consecutive forming, material transfer and galling occur under high temperatures. Two sets of scratch tests were performed to study the galling behavior in sheet metal forming using force and acoustic emission sensors [216]. In the first test set, scratch tests were performed at a different depth of penetration to segregate the non-galling and galling conditions. In the second test set, scratch tests were performed at a different sliding distances to understand the influence of galling on the abrasive wear modes. Sahlot and Arora [217] developed a numerical model for prediction of tool wear during friction stir welding of $\\mathrm { C u C r Z r }$ alloy. Tool wear and worn-out pin profile were calculated according to a modified Archard wear equation. The calculated worn-out pin profile was validated with experimental measurements. In Ref. [218], tool wear in ultrasonic machining process was studied with numerical simulation method. Additively manufactured (AM) tool steel samples prepared by using selective laser melting (SLM) were tested on pin-on-disc tester in contact with aluminum alloy pin at the similar temperature conditions as in hot forming of aluminum alloys. Profilometric investigations revealed that the wear tracks were wide and shallow, with the greatest width being detected at $4 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and the deepest wear track at $4 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ Particularly at 450 and $5 0 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } ,$ most of the wear debris released from the AM tool steel surface attached to the aluminum alloy pin and modified the tool steel-aluminum alloy contact. At $5 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } ,$ the wear debris formed a glaze layer on the aluminum alloy pin surface [219].\n\nIn the last part of this section, recent researches on wear of polymer materials will be briefly discussed. Polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) is a kind of polymers with excellent lubricity. A drawback of PTFE is the low wear resistance. To overcome the problem, hard fillers such as glass fiber or metal oxides are often added into the PTFE matrix. Ye et al. published two papers [220, 221] on the wear of alumina reinforced PTFE. In Ref. [220], they measured topographical evolution of transfer film of PTFE on the counterface, and found a 10-times drop in wear rate of the counterface with the increased transfer film area fraction and sliding distance. A rule-of-mixture wear model was proposed to explain the observations. In Ref. [221], they studied the effects of surface topography on the formation of transfer film and wear. They found that preferential removal of the tallest peaks on the counterface helped stabilize the transfer films and dramatically reduced the transient wear volume of the polymer composite, and that intersecting valleys and smooth plateaus helped nucleate and stabilize transfer films. Qi et al. [222] also reported ring-on-disk experiment results of wear of PTFE reinforced with PEEK and alumina. Based on the observations of evolutions of wear rate, worn surface morphology, transfer film, and debris morphology, the authors identified three wear stages, initial wear stage, severe wear transition stage, and ultralow stable wear stage. Panda et al. [223] proposed an analytical model for prediction of mechanistic wear of polymer materials. The model is derived on the assumptions of abrasive wear and fatigue wear, and validation experiments with PEEK, PMMA, and PVC against 316L stainless steel were performed. A wear equation was proposed to predict the wear rate of elastomers, considering the dominant material properties as well as operating variables. The exponents and coefficient of the equation were obtained experimentally, which represent the significance of each parameter. A good correlation was observed between the calculated and measured wear rates [224].",

      "content": "In recent years, with the progress in theoretical approaches, improved experimental techniques, and rapidly growing numerical capabilities, understanding of the fundamental processes of wear has been improving remarkably. In 2018, the International Workshop on Science of Wear was held at the State Key Laboratory of Tribology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. More than 50 scientists from 12 countries participated in the workshop, and 23 invited presentations were conducted. At the same time, a special issue on science of wear, including one review article, 7 research articles, and one short communication, selected from the workshop presentations, was published in the journal of Friction. The review article in Ref. [225] contained an extensive historical review of adhesive wear mechanisms uncovered by atomistic simulations, emphasizing the interplay between plasticity and adhesion in wear process and the important role of a characteristic length scale governing the adhesive wear. Popov and Pohrt [226] introduced a new formulation which avoids completely the concept of micro-contact or asperity in wear simulation, and demonstrated the application of the new approach by a series of numerical simulation of wear of rough, adhesive sliding surfaces based on the boundary element method. Their simulation results indicated a possible breakdown of Archard’s law of wear. In Ref. [227], friction and wear rate of a lubricated point contact during running-in process were carefully studied by using a stop-and-go experimental scheme, and the effects of boundary layer formation and surface smoothing on friction and wear were distinguished explicitly with comprehensive analytical equations. Wang et al. [228] used comparative molecular field analysis and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis methods to analyze the antiwear properties of a series of 57 esters, and they proposed a predictive 3D-quantitative structure tribo-ability relationship model, which considers much more governing parameters than previous models. Finite element simulation was used to predict the failure process of self-lubricating spherical plain bearings in the swinging wear condition based on the Archard adhesive wear equation [229]. Both the running-in and stable wear stages were investigated. The location of worn out point was found from the calculated distribution of contact pressure, and the increase of wear depth with swinging number up to 25,000 times was predicted, which was validated by experiment results. In Ref. [186], the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of pure iron surfaces was physically modeled with the atomic force microscope (AFM). The effect of oxide film on material removal with $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ -based acidic slurry was investigated. The authors concluded that chemical corrosion-enhanced mechanical wear may dominate the CMP process of iron substrate. The single asperity sliding friction and wear were studied by Yang and Shi by using molecular dynamics simulations [230]. They found that the coupling between wear and friction is much higher in the plastic wear regime than in the atomic wear regime.\n\nAmonton’s first law holds, and no lubrication effect from wear debris is observed in the atomic wear regime. The special issue was closed by a short review of the work of Rabinowicz on adhesive wear [231]. In 1958, Rabinowicz published a short historic paper on his fundamental ideas on the looseness of wear particles and proposed the criterion of critical size of wear particles, which has impacted on the research of wear and materials science for the past 60 years.\n\nBesides of the aforementioned special issue, there are some wear modeling work published in other journals. Arnaud and Fouvry [232] developed a finite element formulation to simulate fretting wear with a coupled Matlab-Python-Abaqus algorithm. By taking into account the effect of the trapped wear debris, the error of prediction of the maximum wear depth was reduced from $8 0 \\%$ to less than $1 0 \\%$ , comparing with experiments. They concluded that the third body effect is more geometrical than rheological. By using the principle of thermodynamics, Lijesh and Khonsari [233] proposed an adhesive wear model which relates degradation coefficient, load-dependent friction force, and contact temperature. The feature of the wear model is able to account of loading sequence, which is different from the constant load assumption adopted in Archard’s wear law. Zhang et al. [234] presented a stochastic model for prediction of the evolutions of wear profile and surface height probability density function (PDF) of initial line contacts during running-in under mixed lubrication condition. The wear depth on the contact region was estimated according to the modified Archard’s wear model using the asperity contact pressure. Sugimura’s wear model was modified and used to link the wear particle size distribution and the variation of surface height PDF during wear. A transient mixed lubrication-wear coupling model (MLW coupling model) is developed to investigate the mixed lubrication and wear performances of journal bearings [235]. Molecular dynamics simulation was used to study abrasive wear behavior via nanoscratching of a $\\mathrm { C u } 6 4 . 5 \\mathrm { Z r } 3 5 . 5$ metallic glass [236]. A new wear model for sub-rough surface contacts in the context of deformation and theories of adhesion was proposed [237]. The wear model is based on studies on causes of their formation due to phase and structural heterogeneity of the material. A discrete element method was designed to evaluate the relative wear on hoppers caused by friction during operation in an open-pit mine. The results of the model showed good agreement with measurements on real industrial hoppers [238]. An adhesive-fatigue dual mode wear model was proposed for fractal surfaces in cylinderplane contact pairs [239]. Adhesive and fatigue wear mechanisms were distinguished based on the critical diameter of the contact area between two asperities. The fractal function was employed to derive the formula for wear loss for the fractal surface asperities on the surfaces of cylinder-plane contact pairs. In Ref. [240], a physics-based fatigue wear model was proposed to predict the life of cumulative micropitting wear for lubricated conformal contacts on rough surfaces. An elastic-plastic coated rough surface contact model was presented in Ref. [241], which incorporates existing single coated asperity contact models in a GW-based statistical multi-coated-asperity surface model. Effects of the coating thickness and its material properties as well as the substrate surface roughness on the mode of the coated surface contact deformation and its contact behavior were investigated through a qualitative parametric analysis. An adaptive finite element model was developed to predict false brinelling in a cylindrical bearing, during the transportation of new trains and compared with experimental measurements [242]. In Ref. [243], a new wear prediction method of tooth surfaces of involute gears based on a real tooth surface model and a modified fractal method is developed.",

      "content": "Wear state of machine components in operation is detected and on-line monitored by using single or multiple techniques of vibration measurement, oil analysis, acoustic emission, image analysis, and proximity probes, etc. An on-line visual ferrograph (OLVF) method was used to monitor the wear of a small-scale four-cylinder diesel engine for $4 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ operation [244]. The images of wear debris in lubricant oil were continuously captured, and the image features were extracted after data correction, reconstruction, and de-noising. An improved grey relevance vector machine prediction model (GM-RVM) was established to analyze the image data. It is demonstrated that the OLVF method and the improved GM-RVM model are effective for on-line wear monitoring. Continuous on-line wear particle monitoring was also applied to detection of gear pitting failure together with vibration monitoring [245, 246]. It was shown that the concentration of metallic particles in oil correlate well with the severity of macropitting. To reduce the influence of noise in real-time wear particle detection, a fuzzy morphology component analysis method was developed to de-noise the wear debris signals [247]. In Ref. [248], acoustic emission (AE) signals were used for condition monitoring of mechanical seals. A comprehensive model of AE energy discharge under different lubrication regimes was developed, and the RMS of AE signals was correlated with sliding speed. Surface failure of mechanical seals was detected from the detected deviation from the predicted trends. In Ref. [249], a deterministic AE RMS model under sliding friction was proposed, referring to the Fan statistic model. The proposed model was applied to non-Gaussian and Bi-Gaussian surfaces, and found that surface topography has strong influence on the AE RMS values. Vibration signals correlate with the surface damages of wheel/rail contacts [250]. When surface cracks appear on the surface of wheel rollers, the characteristic frequency of wheel roller is about $1 , 8 3 0 \\mathrm { H z } ,$ while the characteristic frequencies are about 800 and $7 3 \\ \\mathrm { H z }$ for peeling and spalling damages on wheel roller. This indicates that wheel/roller damages can be detected by analysis of vibration signals. In some conditions, wear depth can be measured in-situ directly by using a proximity displacement probe. This method was used in the experiment of fretting wear [251]. The measurement results showed a high wear rate in the running-in stage followed by a mild steady state wear rate. Optical and laser scanning confocal microscopy and image processing tools were employed to provide quantification of surface roughness, wear severity, and wear depth on gear teeth during a lubricated endurance test, which allow a non-contact imaging-based measurements in two- and three-dimensions and without gearbox disassembly and tooth removal. Detailed qualitative analysis on the progression of the two main wear mechanisms (abrasive wear and fatigue pitting) was provided, alongside an evaluation of the diagnostic capabilities offered by the proposed methodology [252].\n\nThe size and shape information of wear debris can be used in diagnosis of wear. Kumar and Ghosh [253] found that the Weibull probability distribution function has more potential to fit the wear particle size distribution accurately than the Rayleigh model in case of heavy earth moving machines. According to the features of wear particle shape, wear particles can be classified. A genetic programming method was used to do the wear particle classification [254], which shows a high classification accuracy and robustness. Nonferrous metal particles can not be detected with conventional ferrograph technique. A microfluidic chip was designed and fabricated to detect nonferrous metal particles in oil with electromagnetic field [255]. Copper particles (size: $2 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } ,$ ) were successfully detected at $2 \\ \\mathrm { M H z }$ excitation frequency, and the imaginary part of impedance changes without adding any device, which provides with a prominent guideline for detection of nonferrous particles of size less than $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . A convolutional neural network (CNN) model called FECNN is proposed to identify wear particles in complex ferrography images [256]. In Ref. [257], morphological features of wear debris from bearings, including quantity, colour, size, and shape, were extracted from videos of moving particles carried in lubrication oil. Moving particles were detected and tracked based on the Gaussian background mixture model and the blob detection algorithm, and the target particles were separated from the image background by background subtraction. The developed techniques for online particle feature extraction were applied to a rolling element bearing test rig. Analysis of oil contaminants was performed in Ref. [258] by applying a fuzzy inference system (FIS) and neural networks. The multilayer perception network was found to be an effective tool. The concentrations of iron and soot particles in used oil were selected as being both illustrative and the most significant model variables.",

      "content": "Nitride, oxide, carbide, and boride are representative hard coatings widely used in machine elements, metal working tools, and some biomedical parts. These coatings can be formed with chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), thermal spray, and other coating processes on various substrates of materials. Habibolahzadeh and Haftlang [259] found that cubic boron nitride (c-BN) phase could be formed besides of $\\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { B }$ and FeN in a duplex surface treatment of steel via pack boriding and plasma nitriding. The coating shows a pebblelike surface and a sawtooth interface with substrate. Compared with sole boriding treatment, the duplex treatment exhibits superior wear resistance. Von et al. [260] investigated the effect of crystal orientations of CVD Ti(C,N) coatings on the abrasive wear resistance, and found that the ${ < } 1 1 1 >$ oriented coating exhibited a $2 0 \\%$ higher wear resistance and $3 5 \\%$ better abrasion resistance compared to the reference coating, and they attributed the higher resistance to the higher hardness at the ${ \\mathrm { - } } 1 1 1 { \\mathrm { > } }$ orientation. In Ref. [261], the tribological behavior of atmospheric plasma spray (APS) $\\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ coating under mixed and boundary lubrication condition in the presence of friction modifier MoDTC were experimentally investigated and compared with those of steel and steel APS coating. They found long crystalline ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 }$ flakes could be formed and attached on the APS $\\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ coating and resulted in substantial reduction in friction and wear compared to steel and steel APS surfaces. TiAlN, TiCN, and AlCrN coatings are deposited with PVD or CVD process and used widely as wear resistant coatings at high temperatures. The PVD AlCrN coated on stainless steel were tested in the wide ranges of sliding speeds and temperatures up to $8 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } ,$ rubbing against $\\mathrm { S i } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { N } _ { 4 } ,$ $\\mathrm { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 } ,$ and $\\mathrm { Z r O } _ { 2 }$ ceramic balls, and the wear mechanism of the coating was revealed [262]. The deposition of PVD AlTiN/CrN multilayer can also be combined with boriding treatment of steel. The hardness of the multilayer was about twice of the borided layer, which was also 2 times greater than the hardness of the quenched and tempered substrate AISI M2 steel, and the borided+multilayer exhibited the highest dry sliding wear resistance in all test conditions [263]. The CVD TiCN/alpha– ${ \\bf \\nabla } \\cdot { \\bf A l } _ { 2 } { \\bf O } _ { 3 }$ coating was applied to cemented carbide cutting inserts, and the tool life was tested by longitudinal turning of three kinds of steels, 42CrMo4, Ck60, and $1 0 0 \\mathrm { C r } 6$ . At the highest cutting speed of $2 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { m / m i n } ,$ the tool life was 3 and $2 6 \\mathrm { { m i n } }$ for cutting of $4 2 \\mathrm { C r M o 4 }$ and $1 0 0 { \\mathrm { C r } } 6 ,$ respectively. At the lowest cutting speed of $1 5 0 \\mathrm { m / m i n } ,$ the tool life was 46 and $9 4 \\mathrm { m i n }$ for cutting of 42CrMo4 and Ck60, respectively [264]. The PVD TiAlN and $\\mathrm { C V D \\ T i C N / A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } / T i N }$ coated cemented carbide grades were also tested by cutting of AISI 4340, AISI 52100, and AISI D2 hardened steels. It is found that the turning time was longer than $3 0 \\ \\mathrm { m i n }$ for cutting of AISI 4340 steel with hardness of 55HRC when the PVD coated cemented carbide grade was used, while for cutting of AISI 52100 and D2 steels with the hardness of 50 and 45HRC respectively, the tool life was no longer than $1 5 \\mathrm { { m i n } }$ . They also observed that the CVD coated cemented carbide grade had longer tool life than the PVD coated one [265]. The titanium nitrides (Ti–TiN– $( \\mathrm { T i } , \\mathrm { C r } , \\mathrm { A l } , \\mathrm { S i } ) \\mathrm { N } ,$ and zirconium nitrides $( Z \\mathrm { r } { - } Z \\mathrm { r N } { - } ( \\mathrm { N b } , Z \\mathrm { r } , \\mathrm { C r } , \\mathrm { A l } ) \\mathrm { N }$ and $\\mathrm { Z r - Z r N - } ( \\mathrm { Z r } , \\mathrm { A l } , \\mathrm { S i } ) \\mathrm { N } )$ nanostructured multilayers were deposited on WC–Co tool steel, and their cutting properties were compared in turning AISI 321 steel [266]. Thermal spray technology has been widely used to fabricate wear resistance coatings on components. In order to improve the properties of coatings and accelerate the innovation of materials, Chen et al. [267–269] investigated the coating formation mechanism from a more microscopic perspective, including the particle in-flight status and droplet spreading process. Gu et al. [270] analyzed the coated and textured ring/liner conjunction based on a thermal mixed lubrication mode. High velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) and high velocity air-fuel (HVAF) spraying techniques were used to deposit FeVCrCbased coatings to increase wear resistance of metals, and these coatings exhibited very low sliding wear rates [271]. Atmospheric plasma spray was used to make chromium oxide coating on a low-carbon steel, and the effect of arc-current and spray distance on the mechanical properties of the coating was investigated [184]. The research results showed that both of arc current and spray distance had an appropriate value to obtain good density and fracture toughness of the coating. In Ref. [272], three kinds of coatings, chromium carbide $( \\mathrm { C r C } )$ coating, Ni–P coating, and boronized nickel alloy were investigated at room temperature and $4 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ using a specialized tribometer. Among the tested samples, boronized nickel alloy surface outperformed the coatings with lower friction coefficient and lower wear rate, especially at elevated temperature.",

Electroplating and plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) are typical electrochemical coating methods. In Ref. [273], a Ni–B coating was deposited on AISI 1040 steel specimens using an electroless method, and its tribological behavior at elevated temperatures was investigated on a pin-on-disk testrig. The electroless Ni–B coating showed excellent wear resistance at $3 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } ,$ but became worse at 100 and $5 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ due to severe oxidation and softening of the deposits. In the range from room temperature to $5 0 0 ^ { \\circ } C ,$ the wear mechanism changed from adhesion to a combination of adhesion and abrasion as the temperature raised from ambient condition to $1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } ,$ following which the wear mechanism was predominantly abrasive. The formation of a tribochemical oxide film also affected the tribological behavior of the coating at high temperature. Ríos et al. [274] compared the wear resistance of PEO treated titanium alloy Ti6Al4V in alkaline solution with untreated one, and found the coating improved antiwear performance of the alloy. They also found the lubrication with the simulated body fluid (SBF) could extend the sliding distance from $1 5 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ under dry condition to $1 0 0 \\mathrm { m }$ without a significant wear. The effect of PEO voltage and post heat treatment (HT) temperature on the crystallinity, nanohardness, and wear resistance of PEO layers on Ti6Al4 substrate was investigated [275]. It is found that the higher applied voltage and HT temperature resulted in higher wear resistance due to increases in crystalline rutile phase in the oxide layer, hardness, and elastic modulus in nanoindentation. To improve the durability and reliability of diesel engine pistons, a ceramic coating was deposited using a combination process of microarc oxidation and electrophoresis deposition on the skirt of a high-silicon aluminum alloy piston. The friction coefficient measured on a reciprocating dry sliding test reduced by $3 5 \\%$ against a boron copper cast iron liner material, and wear loss decreased by $9 5 \\%$ compared to the substrate aluminum alloy [276].",

Recently, an aromatic thermosetting copolyester (ATSP) coating was tested for applications at high temperatures or under cryogenic conditions [277, 278]. Experiment results exhibited that the ATSP coating has excellent performance in friction and wear reduction compared to bare tool steel at wide temperature range from $- 1 6 0$ to $2 6 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ under pressures over $1 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { M P a }$ . The mechanism of the favorable tribology behavior roots in the polymer transfer film on the steel counterpart during dry friction. To find a better solid lubricant for deep drawing of automotive steel sheets, octyl-, dodecyl-, or octadecylphosphonic acid coatings on $\\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -coated galvanized steel substrates were investigated using linear friction testing (LFT). The test data showed that the coatings can reduce friction coefficient remarkably from 0.31 to less than 0.11 [279]. Water contact angle (WCA), XPS, and IR data indicated that most of the physisorbed phosphonates became chemisorbed with time in an ageing test, increasing hydrophobicity and tribological properties of the surfaces. To prevent threads from galling, an environmental friendly self-lubricating $\\mathrm { A g }$ and Ag-polytetrafluoroethylene composite coatings using a non-cyanide electroplating process was developed [280]. Experiment results indicate that the non-cyanide Ag-polytetrafluoroethylene coating is a potentially viable replacement for the commercially available cyanide $\\mathrm { A g }$ coating which is both hazardous to human health and its wastes are detrimental to the environment. However, potential risks of failure through poor lubrication during the make-up process exist and further improvement of the make-up process is needed. Barbakadze et al. [281] developed an inorganic-organic hybrid composites and antibiocorrosive coatings with low friction and high scratch resistance. The coatings are based on an epoxy modified with silicon-containing polyepoxies and bioactive coordination compounds. The hybrids are optically transparent, visually homogeneous, with smooth surfaces.",

      "content": "Besides coatings, a variety of surface modification techniques, including mechanical, chemical, thermal, electromagnetic, and optical processes, have been developed to enhance tribological and surface properties of mechanical components. Ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification (UNSM) is one of mechanical strengthening processes, which attracts a lot of attention in industrial applications in recent years. It is considered that the UNSM treatment can generate large compressive residual stress, refine grain sizes in the subsurface, and increase surface hardness, resulting in a higher wear and micropitting resistance [282−285]. The technique has been applied to bearing raceway [282], ball screws made of SCM445H, NF42CD4, and SAE4150 [283], and even graphite used in cover glass moldings [284]. The UNSM treatment was also combined with surface texturing to improve the wear resistance of spherical plain bearings used in aircrafts [285]. It is reported that the wear resistance of spherical plain bearings was increased by more than $5 5 \\%$ Slide diamond burnishing is a similar mechanical strengthening method which has been applied to valve stems [286]. Repeated hammering (HM) is a kind of severe plastic deformation (SPD) treatments to nanocrystallize metallic surfaces. In Ref. [287], the HM treatment was applied to AZ31 Mg alloy, followed by recovery treatment (HR). Experiment results showed that the SPD-HR sample had a superior nanocrystalline surface exhibiting the highest wear resistance. Friction process can also result in the formation of a modified surface layer. This method was applied to an elastomer reinforced by silica [288]. The existence of a modified surface layer after the pre-running was investigated by using a scanning electron microscope. The results showed that the existence of a modified surface layer depends on the competition between the formation rate of the layer and the wear rate.\n\nLaser surface texturing (LST) was implemented with a laser micromachining system for replicating topographic features of a honing stone in a WC-base cemented carbide grade, commonly employed for making tools [289]. The laser-patterned cemented carbide tools could be used in honing process, as alternative to conventional honing stones. Laser treatment was also applied to 8260 grade rail steel with a high power diode laser [290]. While it was expected that an increase in surface hardness depending on increasing processing temperatures will result in reduction in wear rate and friction coefficient in laser treated samples. On the contrary an opposite situation in tribological behaviours was found. Laser shock peening (LSP) was used to treat Ti–6Al–4V alloy, and compared with untreated samples in impact wear experiments. Results showed that LSP has no significant effect on mechanical properties and wear resistance of Ti–6Al–4V alloys under the same test conditions [291]. In recent years, 3D printing was also used for texturing thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) samples [292]. Experiment results exhibited that the spherical-convex textures appeared to facilitate the removal of friction pair debris from the surfaces, reduced the adhesion between the friction pairs and strengthened the wedge effect and cavitation effects of the water flow. Compared to the non-texture samples, the $1 / 3$ spherical texture samples with an $S = 3 8 \\%$ exhibited improved tribological properties, and the friction coefficient of these samples was decreased by $6 4 . 4 7 \\%$ .\n\nChemical etching was applied to Al–Si alloy cylinder liner to improve its wear resistance [293]. Experiment results showed that $5 \\%$ NaOH solution was an effective chemical agent to etch the surface of Al–Si alloy samples. The 2 min etched Al–Si alloy samples exhibited low friction coefficient and small weight loss. In contrast, overetching led to even more seriously worn out surface as observed in the samples etched for more than 3 min. Chemical etching was also used to change the hydrophobicity of brass and aluminum surfaces [294, 295]. By two-step (with a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids, followed by treatment with lauric acid) and one-step (treatment with lauric acid) chemical etching, the surface was roughened, and a high water static contact angle $( > 1 7 3 ^ { \\circ } )$ and a low sliding angles $( < 4 ^ { \\circ } )$ were achieved. Further, the coatings exhibited self-cleaning and anti-fogging properties. In Ref. [296], a facile surface treatment method was proposed to improve the abrasion resistance of photosensitive film for screen printing. The wear resistance of photosensitive films treated with $1 5 \\mathrm { { w t \\% } }$ of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (KH550) was increased by $3 4 \\%$ compared with that of pure film. Moreover, surface treatment with KH550 led to a decrease in surface roughness of photosensitive films and an increase in their hydrophobicity.\n\nStrong magnetic field may cause changes in microstructures and mechanical properties of materials to some extent. A pulse-magnetic field was applied on AISI 1045 steel samples, and effect of the magnetic treatment on friction and wear was investigated [297]. Dislocation densities of AISI 1045 steel were found to increase by $1 6 . 5 \\%$ after magnetic treatment. The treated steel performed better under polyalphaolefin (PAO) base oil lubrication with each of five additives, especially when oleic acid was $0 . 2 \\%$ and $1 . 5 \\%$ (by mass), and the wear scar width and friction coefficient of treated samples were $4 6 . 9 \\%$ and $1 6 . 4 \\%$ lower than those of the untreated samples, respectively. Two types of commercial WC–Ni samples were irradiated with the high-intensity pulsed ion beam (HIPIB), and compared their tribological properties sliding against graphite under water lubrication.\n\nAramesh et al. [298] proposed an innovative tool treatment for improving tool wear and reducing chipping during machining of the super alloy of Inconel 718. The treatment involves less than two seconds of machining on an aluminum-silicon (Al–Si) workpiece, resulting in a thin transfer layer of Al–Si on the tool surface, prior to the actual machining of Inconel. During the subsequent machining of the Inconel bar, the Al–Si layer was melted due to the high temperatures of Inconel machining. The molten material channeled itself through the microcracks on the tool surface and seized their propagation. The sliding of the tool on the low friction Al–Si layer resulted in much lower forces, less sticking, seizure and built-up edge formation and, thereby, in less tool wear and chipping. Several beneficial lubricious and thermal barrier tribo-films were also formed on the tool face, which further protected the tool from chipping and severe tool wear. The preconditioning of the tool itself through this process resulted in tool performance improvement by lowering the tool wear at the running-in stage. To improve the machinability of Inconel 718, a cryogenic minimum quantity lubrication technique was proposed and compared with dry, wet, minimum quantity lubrication, and cryogenic cooling conditions. It is found that minimum quantity lubrication and cryogenic conditions exhibited superior performance in cutting force and tool wear than wet and dry conditions [299]. High-speed cutting of Inconel 718 under eco-friendly machining methods of cryogenic carbon dioxide $\\left( \\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } \\right)$ and dry cutting conditions was also studied with PVD tungsten carbide coated ball nose milling inserts [300]. It was reported that cryogenic $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ showed significant improvement towards increasing the tool life to a maximum of $7 0 . 8 \\%$ relative to dry cutting.",

      "content": "The largest percentage of the studies in biotribology was found to be in the area of joint tribology. Both natural systems and artificial joint replacements received significant attention.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 20 Number of records in different areas searched from Web of Science.\n\nThe focus on the natural synovial joint was on the understanding of the underlying tribological mechanisms from friction, wear, and lubrication points of view [306]. Both normal and diseased tissues were generally considered, as well as the development of biomimetic cartilage replacements such as hydrogels [307−313] and synovial fluid substitutions such as synthetic biolubricants [314−316].\n\nBiomaterials research for artificial joint replacements mainly focused on the improvement of the wear resistance currently used in clinical practice, such as metallic (cobalt chromium molybdenum alloys and titanium alloys), polymeric (ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, UHMWPE) and ceramics, as well as novel biomimetic materials and combinations with potentials for longer lasting life of the implant. Silicon nitride bioceramics were investigated [317] as well as composite ceramics, to optimize both the hardness and the toughness, such as zirconia toughened alumina [318], carbonfiber reinforced silicone-carbide [319], and hexagonal boron nitride mixed with silicon nitride [320], etc. In addition to the improvement of highly crossed linked UHMWPE, potentially high performance polymers and composites were also investigated, such as ultra-low-wear polyethylene [321], polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [322] and hydrogels [323], porous polycarbonate-urethane and UHMWPE blends [324], polycarbonate urethanes [325], and polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl pyrrolidone blend hydrogels [326]. Other composites included hybrid polymer matrix composites reinforced with ceramics [327], Ti6Al4V cellular structures impregnated with PEEK [328]，and ceramic-metal composites [329]. New technologies such as 3D printing were also increasingly considered in joint tribology [324, 330].\n\nSurface modifications/texturing and coatings were one of the common approaches for obtaining life-long orthopedic bearings for both soft [331] and hard bearing surfaces [305, 332−336]. Surface grafting was investigated for PEEK [337] and metal [338] bearing surfaces. Hard coatings included TiN [339], zirconium nitride multilayer coating [340], and tantalum carbide coating [341], etc., for the bearing surfaces in total hip joint replacements. Other coatings such as sol-gel coating [342], TiCuN solid solution coating [343], etc., were also investigated. Surface treatments included the use of emulsified diffusion of dicumyl peroxide to cross-linking UHWMEP [344] and boriding for Ti6Al4V alloy [345]. It is interesting to note that apart from improving wear resistance, the release from metallic ions, which is being increasingly recognized as a potential problem of metallic biomaterials, was also prevented from coatings [340]. Surface functionalization based on the hydration lubrication of articular cartilage was discussed for $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ wafer and polystyrene microsphere [346].\n\nA number of studies focused on the experimental wear evaluations of the bearing materials for artificial joints. Pre-clinical wear testing remained to be one of the most important considerations, with the major focuses on developing more realistic and more predictive experimental environments such as under adverse conditions. This was found to be particularly important for metal-on-metal hard contacts [347, 348]. The importance of adverse testing in the knee implant was addressed for various alignments and soft tissue conditions [349]. While the majority of wear studies were conducted experimentally, computational wear prediction for the hip was reviewed in Ref. [350]. The integration of biomechanics and biotribology became important and was addressed from both computational [351] and experimental [352, 353] approaches. Other interesting developments included the direct observation of the lubricant film at the articulating surfaces using optical methods [354]. Furthermore, development of integrated computational and experimental methods [355] was also found to be necessary in order to balance the cost and the efficiency. In some applications where early interventions to cartilage repair were sought, natural tissues also became part of the bearing surfaces that were required to be included in the experimental testing [356]. The potential relation between tribological inputs and acoustic emission was also reviewed as a potential diagnostic tool to understand the in-vivo performance of the joint [357].\n\nIn additional to the articulating surfaces, the fixation interface which has not received enough attention previously, was also extensively considered [358, 359] and also in conjunction with wear testing of the bearing surfaces [360]. Modular interfaces with fretting corrosion were increasingly studied at the hip [318, 361−363], the knee [364], and the spine [365, 366] and for new materials combinations of PEEK and XLPE [367]. The contact between implant and bone was also an important consideration [368]. Apart from tribological investigations, other aspects such as the improvement of bone regeneration and anti-bacterial activity also became increasingly focused [369].\n\nWhilst the majority of studies in joint tribology focused on the hip and the knee, other joints such as the elbow [370] and the radial head [371], the patellofemoral [372], the meniscus [373], the shoulder [374], the finger [375], the temporomandibular joint [376], and the ankle [377] were also investigated. Furthermore, animal joints such as the canine hip implant were considered [378].\n\nWhile the main focus of the present joint tribology was on the engineering aspects of biotribology, a number of clinical and biological studies were also found [379, 380]. Tribological effects at cellular levels [381, 382] and on regenerative ability [383] were also found to be increasingly examined.",

The main considerations in oral tribology were the wear of artificial replacements as well as natural teeth. The underlying wear mechanisms of natural teeth, the lubrication mechanisms of saliva also received significant attention. The importance of the lubrication of soft oral tissues was also recognized [386]. Other interesting areas included perception of foods as well as archeological findings in relation to tribology.\n\nComposite resins were widely used in dentistry to repair damaged teeth and to restore enamel defects. A number of biomaterials were considered, including ceramics based [387−392], metallic based such as Mg−Co nanocomposites [393], CoCrW–Cu alloys [394] and Ti−Cu alloys [395], and other materials based [328, 396−400]. Coatings and surface treatments were also widely used [401−404], similar to joint tribology. The effects of oral environments on the wear of dental materials were investigated such as PH [405] and bacteria [406], as well as materials aging [407, 408]. Other testing considerations included abrasive solutions [409], and contact configuration and lubricating conditions [410]. The importance of implant design and analysis was also recognized [411−413], as well as the fretting of dental implants [414].\n\nThe main focus on the wear of natural teeth was on the underlying wear mechanisms. A number of variables were considered, including contact load [415, 416], toothpastes [417], different specimens [418−420], and environments [421−424]. One of the interesting findings was that dental enamel was abraded by softer particles [422, 423]. In addition to wear studies, frictional coefficients during flossing of teeth were measured [425]. Animal models [426] and in vitro and in vivo clinical models were developed [415, 427]. The importance of saliva in oral tribology was also increasingly recognized, including changes in saliva due to age [428], dry mouth, and in vitro simulation system [429], effect of palm oil [430], and bio-lubricants[167].\n\n$\\bullet$ It is interesting to note a wide perspective in the area of oral tribology, from dietary, evolutionary, archeological, ecological, and paleontological points of view [384, 385, 431−436]. A close relationship between the rheology of the foods and the oral perception/flavour was demonstrated [425, 437−442]. Biomechanical environments and effects of friction were found to be important for various dental treatments, especially for orthodontic treatments [443]. Titanium nitride plating was developed to improve the corrosion resistance of orthodontic wires [444], while biomechanical variables and coatings were examined to control friction [445−449]. It is also interesting to note a number of similarities of the research between joint tribology and oral tribology. Similar technologies were used in both areas. The importance of corrosion was equally found for joint implants and dental implants [450−452]. Similar surface treatments and coatings were also applied [453−455]. Nevertheless, a number of limitations were identified in oral tribology, as compared with joint tribology. Simple experimental set-ups with simple configurations were often adopted to simulate chewing mechanics [387, 456], while more complex and sophisticated joint simulators were developed as discussed in joint tribology.",

The majority of studies in skin tribology focused on friction and tactile perception of skins as well as practical applications. Finger perception and friction was one of the most examined areas in skin tribology. Development of tactile transducers also received significant attention.\n\nThe tribological mechanisms of skin were mainly studied from friction, contact mechanics, lubrication etc points of view [458]. Both human and animals skins [459] were adopted, including soft skins, hard scales [460, 461], and heads [462, 463]. Some of the friction studies adopted an artificially chosen hard counterface such as a metallic or glass subject, while in other studies fabrics were often used [464]. Most studies in skin tribology adopted experimental approaches, while only a few focused on theoretical investigations [465, 466]. The effects of the presence of different media on skin friction were examined [467−469], while lubrication was analyzed for water snails [470].\n\nOne of the major focuses in skin tribology was the relation between tribological properties and skin perception, tactile and haptics, particularly the finger [471, 472]. Both the skin and the perceived objects were involved in the contact and therefore were important considerations, including surface texture [473, 474], softness [475], and chemistry [476], etc. Perception was correlated with tribological properties such as friction, vibration, stickiness, contact mechanics [477], and different environments [478, 479], and different subjects including age, gender, etc [480, 481]. Various apparatus of friction measurements in conjunction with measuring brain responses and other physiological measurements were adopted [482−485]. In addition to the feel and identification of objects, other activities such as grasping and cutting processes with scissors were also investigated [486]. The relation between the morphology, biotribology, and sensory perception of a single human hair was discussed in Ref. [487].\n\n$\\bullet$ There were a number of applications in skin tribology, particularly in robotics [488], rehabilitation [489], and biomimics [490]. Other studies were devoted to friction reduction [491], medical applications such as suture [492], electronic skins, and artificial fingers [493, 494].\n\nTribology of skin was found to be quite complex, with multiple factors and at multiple scales, and a systematic and multi-disciplinary approach was required.",

General biomaterials, especially metallic, also received significant attention. Ocular tribology, including the eye, contact lenses and lubricants, and the underlying lubrication mechanism, was also increasingly investigated. While most of studies in biotribology focused on macroscopic materials, an increasing number of investigations examined microscopically at cell levels. Tribological studies in animals also received significant attention, covering a number of animals such as geckos, birds, beetles, and earthworms, etc. Both the underlying mechanisms of the natural organs and the biomimetic applications were important. The focus on plant tribology was mainly from developing more environmental friendly lubricants.\n\n$\\bullet$ Biomaterials: A number of biomaterials were developed for general applications, including novel soft hydrogels [495]. Various coatings were examined to improve tribological properties [496, 497], while other considerations such as improving antimicrobial activity [498], bone in-growth [499] were also considered. Other soft coatings such as hydrogel coating for biomedical devices [500] and brushes [501] were also developed to reduce friction and improve lubrication. Ocular tribology mainly focused on the eye and contact lenses, from thermo-fluid dynamics [502] and lubrication points of view [503, 504].\n$\\bullet$ The most focused topics in animals tribology were adhesion [505] and friction [506]. A number of\n\nstudies focused on gecko, in terms of developing a biomimetics approach to fabricate the surface features [507] and control the adhesion via direct laser lithography and understanding the underlying mechanisms of the natural system [508]. At the same time, a number of other animals were also considered, for example birds, abalones, insects, and beetles etc [509−513]. Attachment/detachment under water was studied [514].\n\nTribology in other systems: Whilst tribology is important in synovial joints, other parts in the musculoskeletal system may also experience relative motions, such as the tendon. Friction in tendon repair was shown equally important [515].\n\nTribology at cellular levels: The effect of friction on cell behaviors was investigated in a number of studies [516, 517]. The surface treatment of biomaterials was also found to be important for cell adhesion [518]. Furthermore, cell division and death was shown to be regulated mechanically [519].\n\nThe main focus in plants tribology is the development of environmentally friendly lubricants, including vegetable oils [520−522] and coconut oil [523]. Other interesting topics included the prey capture mechanism of certain plants [524].\n\nApplications: A number of practical applications were found in biotribology, mainly from a biomimetics approach, such as development of robot locomotion [525], anti-adhesive surface for electrosurgical knifes [526], and adaptive frictionreduction and antifouling surfaces [527]. Effect of microtrichia on the interlocking mechanism was investigated in the Asian ladybeetle [528]. The importance of tribology principles were also found in food processing, such as cream cheese [529], cereal Kernels [530], and potato peels [499].\n\nAlthough different organs were considered in four different areas in the present review, some generic observations and underlying mechanisms were observed. There were a number of similarities of the biomaterials required between the joint and the dental, as well as the issues such as tribo-corrosion to be addressed. For the soft tissues in the joint, the eye, etc., the lubricating mechanisms may be similar, such as the lubricin is soft tissues [531] and mucins [532]. Furthermore, the application of the engineering principles of tribology to medical and biological fields has been extended from simple combinations to more sophisticated fields such as perception and cellular levels.\n\nThere are a number of limitations of the present review. While the search was attempted to be comprehensive, some references may be omitted due to a wide range of potential topics in biotribology. Grouping of the research areas in biotribology was also subjective, particularly when a multiple of topics were covered in one reference. Discussion on the underlying tribological mechanisms was also limited due to the understanding of the subject. Furthermore, the major focus of the present review was on the engineering aspects of biotribology, medical and biological fields were less emphasized, and some of the clinical studies where tribology was closely related (available from PubMed) were not covered. Nevertheless, the present review may serve as a first source and a more thorough review may be required for a specific area.",

      "content": "There are several applications such as automotive, aerospace, power generation, and metalworking processes in which the interaction of two (relatively moving) contacting solid surfaces occur at high temperatures because of the inherent prevalence of high temperatures. Further, the ever-increasing demand on compact, lightweight, and high performance machines have led to a drastic increase in the transmitted energy densities of mechanical systems. Operation of tribological interfaces of moving machine components in such systems therefore occur more and more under severe contact conditions including those involving high temperatures mainly due to frictional heating. The operation of mechanical systems at elevated temperature has serious consequences in terms of efficiency, performance, and reliability owing to the influence of temperature on friction and wear characteristics of contacting materials.\n\nThe term ‘high temperature tribology’ is ambiguous as there is no general limit as to what high-temperature actually means and it is highly system dependent. A temperature considered high for a polymeric material will not be high for a metallic material such as steel or a ceramic material. In tribology, a ‘high temperature’ can also be defined as the temperature when traditional lubricants such as oils and greases cannot be used (typically above $3 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ as these rapidly decompose and lose their lubricating effectiveness. Aerospace, metalworking, and power generation are several technological applications in which tribological contacts operate at extremely high temperatures, sometimes higher than $9 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ .\n\nSalient effects induced due to operation of tribological interfaces at elevated temperatures are the increased rate of tribochemical reactions (mainly oxidation) and degradation of mechanical properties of the materials. High temperature tribological phenomena are very complex as the surface and near surface characteristics of contacting materials undergo changes when exposed to high temperatures as illustrated in Fig. 21.\n\nThe needs, opportunities, and challenges in high temperature tribology research field have therefore considerably increased in recent years. A search of Scopus database for “high temperature” and tribology under the heading keywords has revealed that the number of articles (including reviews) in high temperature tribology area published during 2010−2019 have more than tripled compared to those published during 2000−2009. The key focus of research has been on characterisation and understanding of friction and wear mechanisms. A very significant part of research efforts has been devoted to controlling friction and wear at high temperatures.\n\nHigh temperature tribological processes are not only complex but also very diverse. In view of this, the scope of this review is limited and only some salient research results published very recently in open literature have been briefly discussed below. Some of the aspects related to high temperature tribology have been covered earlier in Section 3. In order to avoid repetition, the discussion on these has not been included in this section in order to avoid repetition.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 21 Schematic showing the complexity of a sliding contact at elevated temperature.",

      "content": "High temperature tribological studies pertaining to various tribological interfaces in several applications have been reported. However, most of studies pertaining to the effect of high operating temperature on friction and wear have been reported in the context of hot forming and press hardening (also known as hot stamping) areas. The main reasons for this is that the need to make use of lightweight materials in vehicles in order to reduce fuel consumption. The lightweight materials of interest include high/ultrahigh strength boron steel and aluminium alloys. These complex shaped structural and safety components of automobiles made of these materials are difficult to form through conventional forming at room temperatures and have to be formed at high temperatures. The interaction of the tool and work piece at high temperature gives rise to complex tribological phenomena. The understanding of friction and wear phenomena and their control at elevated temperatures is vital in optimisation of hot forming of lightweight material components for improved quality of produced, durability of expensive forming tools, and overall productivity. Some of the pertinent work published recently have been briefly summarised in this section.\n\nIn a review article, Li et al. [533] have highlighted the problem of friction in the context of stamping and in particular in hot forming of new lightweight materials. They have presented the state of the art concerning the mechanisms and factors influencing friction in stamping process. The authors emphasized on the need for further studies pertaining to the macro- and micro stamping friction and for establishing a dynamic multifactor coupling friction model for different stamping methods and materials. Muro et al. [534] have evaluated the friction and wear behaviours of different tool steels sliding against an uncoated $2 2 \\mathrm { M n B } 5$ steel at elevated temperatures by using a high-temperature Optimol SRV reciprocating friction and wear tester at temperatures of 40 and $2 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . The results have shown that frictional behavior of all the three tool steels is similar. Friction decreases when temperature is increased whereas wear increases in the case of the other two tool steels. The authors have concluded that the hardness of the tool steel cannot be the sole criterion in designing hot forming tool steels. Hernandez et al. [535] studied the effect of tool steel sliding against uncoated boron steel at elevated temperatures in open and closed sliding test configurations. At $4 0 0 ^ { \\circ } C ,$ stable friction behaviour has been observed, mainly due to the formation of oxide layers in open as well as closed test configurations, as shown in Fig. 22. Higher amount of $\\mathrm { F e } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ in the layers resulted in a lower friction coefficient for the closed tests compared to that in the open one.\n\nIn another study, Venema et al. [536] have studied the effect of temperature on friction and wear mechanisms during direct press hardening of Al–Si coated UHSS by observing the ongoing friction and wear phenomena on the sheet metal surface as well as the tool. The tests were performed at 8 different strip temperatures from 400 to $7 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ with a step increase of $5 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . At each specific temperature, 10 strips were drawn consecutively using the same set of tools and a new set of strips were used for each temperature. Their results revealed that friction is temperature dependent when sliding occurs between relatively clean tools and sheet, reaching a minimum at $6 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and it has been relatively less sensitive to temperature when tribo-layers are built-up on the tool surface. The authors further reported that the wear mechanisms differ at low and high temperatures. At high temperatures, larger areas suffer abrasive wear damage and more severe ‘compaction of wear particles induced galling’ is seen.\n\nMozgovoy et al. [537] studied the effect of sliding speed, contact pressure, and temperature on the friction and wear response of tool steel sliding against uncoated and Al–Si coated boron steel using a specially designed simulative test. Higher loads led to lower and more stable friction coefficients independent of sliding speed and irrespective of uncoated/coated boron steel, as shown in Fig. 23.\n\nDeng et al. [538] employed a specially designed tribological test for galling evaluation in press hardening conditions at elevated temperature and developed a numerical model of the test in order to understand galling behaviour in terms of the contact conditions at the tool-workpiece interface. The test temperature has been found to be an important factor in terms of the galling severity. At $7 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } ,$ severe galling has been observed whereas mild galling is seen at $6 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ .\n\nIn a fundamental study, Huttunen-Saarivirta et al. [539] have presented an insight into the tribological behaviour of H13 tool steel–6082 aluminium alloy by using a pin on disc test configuration in the context of extrusion process. The tribological tests were conducted at room temperature, 350, 400, 450, and $5 0 0 ^ { \\circ } C ,$ respectively, and using different contact pressures (510 and $8 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { \\ M P a } _ { , }$ ). The results of this study have shown that the tribological behaviour is influenced both by the contact pressure as well as temperature. Galling occurs at higher contact pressure and the tool steel surface damage occurs due to abrasive wear.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 22 Coefficient of friction as a function of sliding distance at $4 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ for (a) the first stroke and (b) the tenth stroke.

The main approaches in controlling friction and wear at high temperatures involve use of speciality lubricants (mostly phase change materials), solid lubricant materials (also called self-lubricating materials), composites, and surface coatings or claddings.\n\nThe major research efforts in the high temperature tribology area are clearly directed towards the development of materials and surface modification technologies for controlling friction and wear. The surface modification technologies (or processes) include the well-known surface hardening (through both thermal and thermochemical processes), thermal spray processes, laser claddings, PVD, and CVD to name a few.\n\nIn general, it is important to control (or minimize) both friction and wear in most cases. However, the primary emphasis in some cases could be to reduce friction whereas it could be wear prevention or control in other cases. Highlights of some of the salient research work reported in open literature pertaining to these aspects are briefly discussed below.",

[540] have designed low melting point glass lubricants of different compositions for hot extrusion of high purity titanium (TA2) at $8 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . Thermal analyses revealed suitable softening points and viscosity of these designed glasses for use as lubricants for hot extrusion of TA2 at $8 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . These glasses were applied as coatings on titanium by facile slurry method. Glass pads were also made by cold pressing a mixture of glass powder, sodium silicate binder, and water for industrial hot extrusion of TA2 tubes. Tribological studies conducted by using ball on disc tribometer at $8 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ showed that the glass coating is effective in reducing both friction and wear of TA2. The surface of the glass coating melts into a viscoelastic film that provides effective lubrication at elevated temperatures.\n\nCui et al. [541] have explored the possibility of using some inorganic compounds such as sodium phosphate, borate as well as layered talc powder and oil-in-water emulsion as a lubricant for hot metal forming process. Experimental studies regarding the performance of these lubricants were carried out by using high temperature pin on disc tests at $9 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and hot rolling tests in which work-piece temperature is about $1 { , } 2 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and work roll surface temperature may fluctuate between $5 0 – 8 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . The authors have reported acceptable performance of sodium polyphosphate and borax with sodium polyphosphate showing slightly better performance. Tran et al. [542−545] also shows acceptable performance but only in hot rolling tests because of the short contact time. Alkaline borates as high temperature lubricants have also attracted attention in the context of hot rolling of steels. Tran et al. [542] investigated the high temperature lubricating effectiveness of sodium borate by using a pin (GCr15) on disc (mild steel) contact configuration and reported its excellent tribological performance in the temperature range $6 0 0 { - } 8 0 0 \\ { \\textdegree }$ (i.e., above the melting point of sodium borate). The authors highlighted the important role of physical chemistry of the borate melt for its tribological response. In another contribution, Tran et al. [543] have analyzed the tribochemistry of borate melt/oxidized steel. They found that the oxidation reaction of borate melt on oxidized steel is due to interface reaction of the oxide particles.",

[546] and another by Zhu et al. [547].\n\nTorres et al. [546] have critically reviewed and analyzed the current trends and design strategies pertaining to high temperature solid lubrication for various classes of self-lubricating materials. A significant increase in scientific work in this field since early 2,000s has taken place. Based on available literature, the effective lubrication ranges for some of the most relevant solid lubricants have been summarized, as shown in Fig. 24.\n\nZhu et al. [547] have presented an overview of the current research developments on high temperature solid lubricating materials that deals with various aspects high temperature solid lubricating materials such as design strategies, know how for construction, progress in this field, applications, and future trends.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 24 Temperature ranges for effective lubrication for several solid lubricants. Reproduced with permission from Ref. [546]. $©$ Taylor & Francis, 2018.\n\nLiu et al. [548] have studied the flow and friction behaviour of 6061 aluminium alloys in the context of forming a B-pillar by using hot stamping process. Besides measuring friction and analysing friction mechanisms, they conducted hot stamping studies on of B-pillar Al6061 (a structural component of a car) using different solution heat treatment as well as different lubricants such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), graphite, and molybdenum disulphide (MoS2). The authors have shown that B-pillars without cracks could be produced by using lubricant. Further, the authors carried out FEM simulations and revealed that cracks were caused by high friction and non-uniform cooling between the side wall and rounded corners of the component.\n\nA new high temperature self-lubricating material, $\\mathrm { C o C r F e N i S } _ { 0 . 5 }$ high entropy alloy (HEA) has been developed by Zhang et al. [549]. In this work, the authors prepared the $\\mathrm { C o C r F e N i S } _ { 0 . 5 }$ HEA by spark plasma sintering (SPS) by using a mixture of $\\mathrm { C o } , \\mathrm { C r } ,$ Fe, ${ \\mathrm { N i } } ,$ and FeS powders. The authors further studied the microstructure, mechanical properties, and tribological performance from room temperature (RT) to $8 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ of the HEA material. The resulting ${ \\mathrm { C o C r F e N i S } } _ { 0 . 5 }$ HEA material consists of a FCC high entropy solidsolution phase and a $\\mathrm { C r } _ { x } S _ { y }$ phase. The average coefficients of friction decreased gradually from 0.41 (at RT) to about 0.35 at $8 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . The authors have attributed the tribological properties of the $_ \\mathrm { C o C r F e N i S _ { 0 . 5 } }$ HEA material from RT to $4 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ to the presence of $\\mathrm { C r } _ { x } S _ { y }$ phase. At high temperatures, synergistic effect of the $\\mathrm { C r } _ { x } S _ { y }$ phase and formation of different oxides on the sliding surfaces leads to the improved tribological properties of HEA. Erdoğan et al. [550] also prepared $\\mathrm { C o C r F e N i T i _ { 0 . 5 } A l _ { \\it x } h i g h }$ entropy alloys with varying Al content by induction melting and studied their dry sliding wear behaviour at various temperatures. The high entropy alloys containing high Al content exhibited superior wear resistance. The authors attributed the high wear resistance to the singlephase ordered BCC (Al–Ni Ti) structure formed at high temperatures.\n\nIn another study, Zhou et al. [551] developed M50 (Cr4Mo4V) steel based composites by incorporating $\\mathrm { A g }$ and $\\mathrm { { A g - T i C } }$ respectively through SPS process. M50 (Cr4Mo4V) steel is used in spindle bearings of aero-engines in view of its good dimensional stability, toughness, and rolling contact fatigue at high temperatures. The authors prepared $\\mathrm { M } 5 0 { - } 5 ~ \\mathrm { w t \\% A g }$ and M50–5 wt%Ag–4 wt%TiC composites and studied their tribological performance in the temperature range of $1 5 0 – 6 0 0 ^ { \\circ } C$ by using a ball on disc tribometer. A $\\mathrm { S i } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { N } _ { 4 }$ ball was used as the counterface material. The authors have shown that the friction and wear performance of $\\mathrm { M 5 0 - 5 ~ w t ^ { \\circ } / o A g - 4 ~ w t ^ { \\circ } / o T i C }$ composite steel is significantly superior to those of $\\mathrm { M } 5 0 { - } 5 \\mathrm { w t \\% A g }$ composites and M50 steel. Further, the tribological performance of M50–5 wt%Ag–4 wt%TiC steel composite has been found to be best at $4 5 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and it has been attributed to the formation of a lubricating film as well as a compacted layer. At $6 0 0 ^ { \\circ } C ,$ the authors suggest that the formation of $\\mathrm { A g _ { 2 } M o O _ { 4 } }$ layer results in friction reduction.",

The Graphite– ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 }$ coating containing $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ graphite resulted in best performance at $2 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . The antiwear property of coating with $3 3 ~ \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ graphite is inferior at $2 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and above $2 0 0 ^ { \\circ } C ,$ the tribological performance of the coating containing $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ graphite also deteriorates. The authors have further reported a critical load (10 N) and rotational speed $( 1 , 2 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { r p m } )$ ) above which the coating with $2 0 \\ \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ graphite is worn through and results in very high friction.\n\nSerra et al.

The results showed superior tribological performance of $\\mathrm { T i N \\mathrm { - } } W S _ { x }$ thin films with varying ${ \\sf W S } _ { x }$ content. Friction and wear showed that $\\mathrm { T i N - } W S _ { x }$ performs better at room temperature than pure TiN.\n\nMeng et al.

They have reported decrease in friction and wear when the temperature is increased up to a critical temperature $( 3 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ but observed an opposite trend above this temperature. The degradation in tribological performance above the critical temperature has been attributed to the oxidation of ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 }$ coating.\n\nTorres et al. [555] also developed Ni-based selflubricating laser claddings with the addition of $\\mathrm { A g }$ and ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 }$ on stainless steel substrates for controlling friction in high temperature applications such as hot metal forming. The special feature of this approach is the addition of $\\mathrm { M o S } _ { 2 }$ to ensure a uniform silver distribution within the cladding by means of an encapsulation mechanism. The incorporation of sulphur-containing transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 }$ and ${ \\sf W S } _ { 2 }$ to the self-lubricating coatings leads to the encapsulation of silver, prevents it from floating to the surface of the melt pool and ensures a uniform microstructure of the resulting laser claddings as can be seen from Fig. 25. These self-lubricating claddings with the addition of solid lubricants such as silver and transition metal dichalcogenides resulted in significantly lower friction compared to the unmodified reference alloy at room temperature, 400, and $6 0 0 ^ { \\circ } C ,$ respectively, as can be seen from Fig. 26 [556]. This is attributed to the beneficial role of the chromium sulphides formed during the laser melting process. Continuing with these investigations further, Torres et al. [557] observed the formation of a protective tribolayer on the counter body after tests at high temperature against the selflubricating claddings. This correlates well with low counter body wear and decreased friction.

[558] developed a hybrid composite coating for hot forming dies by combining a lubricious composite surface coating with a nitro-carburised deep case via plasma nitrocarburising to maximise mechanical support and lubricity at high temperatures. The high temperature adhesion and hot forming performance of the coated dies were evaluated by using a high temperature tribometer and a deepdrawn top-hat apparatus respectively. The obtained results have shown that coated dies experienced negligible adhesion at elevated temperatures and a lubricant-free deep drawing could be done. Further, the authors have proposed a model comparing the frictional state of material surfaces based on the experimental results and analysis of stress states.\n\nDu et al. [559] have developed a Ni–P composite coating with the incorporation of ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { C a F } _ { 2 }$ by electroless plating process and studied its tribological behavior from RT to about $5 7 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . Both friction and wear decreased with an increase in temperature. The good tribological performance of the coating from 200 to $5 7 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ has been due to the synergistic effects of the ${ \\bf M o S } _ { 2 } ,$ oxides, phosphates, sulphates, and small amount of $\\mathrm { C a F } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { C a M o O _ { 4 } }$ formed on the worn surface at high temperatures.\n\nZeng et al. [560] prepared $\\gamma { \\mathrm { - F e } } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 } @ { \\mathrm { S i O } } _ { 2 }$ nanocomposite coatings on steel substrate through sol-gel method and investigated their tribological behaviour at temperatures of 400, 450, 500, 550, and $6 0 0 ^ { \\circ } C ,$ respectively, by using a steel ball against coated disc test configuration in ambient air. The results have shown a strong influence of temperature on friction behavior. Friction decreases as the sliding progresses and the temperature is increased from 400 to $6 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . The change in frictional behaviour with temperature has been attributed to the changes in physical and chemical properties of the nanocomposite coatings because of the tribochemical reaction and phase changes during sliding at high temperature.\n\nBondarev et al. [561] coated VCN–(Ag) on the surface of polished WC–Co and Ni alloy discs, and also on single crystal Si wafers by magnetron co-sputtering of V and C (graphite) and simultaneous sputtering of Ag. The deposition of coatings was done in different gaseous environments $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 }$ and $\\begin{array} { r } { \\mathbf { A r } \\mathbf { + } \\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } ^ { \\prime } } \\end{array}$ ) in order to obtain coatings of different compositions, with and without Ag. The thermal stability, temperatureactivated phase transformations, and friction behaviour of these nanocomposite VCN–Ag coatings were studied during dynamic temperature ramp tribological tests. The authors also carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations and proposed a phenomenological temperature-dependent friction model. The addition of $\\mathrm { A g }$ does not have any significant influence below $2 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ but decreased friction considerably in 250− $3 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ temperature range. In $3 5 0 { - } 4 5 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } C$ temperature range, the friction of VCN coating decreased, whereas that of the ${ \\tt V C N - A g }$ increased due to the formation of different types of oxides and their volume fraction. In the temperature range of $5 0 0 { - } 6 5 0 \\ { ^ { \\circ } C } ,$ the cofficients of friction of VCN and VCN–Ag coatings are similar but a significant decrease in friction of $\\mathbf { A g } .$ -doped VCN coating at $7 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ has been observed due to the formation of $\\mathrm { A g _ { 0 . 4 } V _ { 2 } O _ { 5 } }$ phase and tribo-activated melting.",

      "content": "The research pertaining to the control of wear at high temperatures has attracted very significant growth recently. Some of the notable contributions include high entropy alloy (HEA), stellite-6, Tribaloy, $\\mathrm { C r } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { C } _ { 2 ^ { - } }$ NiC-WC and WC-Co, NiCoCrAlYTa, TiC reinforced Cu-Ni-Mn, TiC/Ti3AlC-Co, TiC-Co, $\\mathrm { N i } 6 0 { + } \\mathrm { h }$ -BN, CrAlSiN, TiAlN/nitride duplex treated and oxide coatings and hardfacings [562−581]. In view of recent developments and growing interest, some of the studies pertaining to HEA laser claddings and micro-arc oxidation (MAO) surface modification techniques for control of wear at high temperatures have been briefly discussed here.\n\n1) HEA coatings: HEAs are a broad group of metallic multicomponent materials (typically 5 or more) in similar mass fractions and ideally composed of a single phase solid solution. The interest in the high temperature tribology research of these alloys is mainly in view of their high hardness, mechanical strength, stability at high temperatures, high strength-toweight ratios, and oxidation and corrosion resistance.\n\nSome of the compositions of HEA having potential for high temperature tribological applications include Fe5Cr5SiTiCoNbMoW, CoCrBFeNiSi, FeCoNiCrCu, Al0.5FeCu0.7NiCoC, and AlCoCrFeNi [562−568]. Shu et al. [563, 564] have developed a wear resistant CoCrBFeNiSi HEA amorphous coating through coating laser cladding. The idea of this study is to combine the advantages of HEAs and amorphous alloys. Microstructural analysis of the coating revealed a layered structure of the coating in which the upper layer comprises of mainly an amorphous phase. The bottom layer has BCC $\\mathrm { C o F e } _ { 1 5 . 7 }$ and FCC $\\gamma ( \\mathrm { F e } , \\ \\mathrm { N i } )$ major crystalline phases and $\\mathrm { C o C _ { 8 } }$ carbide and ${ \\mathrm { C o } } _ { 2 } { \\mathrm { B } }$ boride as the minor crystalline phases. The wear tests conducted at $5 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ revealed mainly abrasive wear in the amorphous layer and adhesive wear in the crystalline layer with amorphous layer showing about $1 0 \\%$ lower wear. Jin et al. [568] prepared laser-cladded FeNiCoAlCu high-entropy alloy coating and evaluated its wear performance at various temperatures up to $8 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ using a WC ball against coated disc test setup. The results have shown very high friction (0.8−0.9) at RT, 200, and $4 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ but significantly lower friction at 600 and $8 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . The authors have also reported good wear performance of the alloy cladding at $8 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and concluded that the wear of FeNiCoAlCu high-entropy alloy coating occurs mainly due to abrasive wear and oxidative wear mechanisms.\n\nThe high temperature tribological behaviour of HEAs is complex and the present understanding pertaining to their friction and wear behaviour so far is inadequate.\n\n2) MAO surface treatment: Liu et al. [580] have evaluated the effect temperature on tribological behaviour of MAO treated 2219 aluminium alloy in laboratory and also in the field (deep well and ultradeep well drilling) where aluminium pipes are used because of its low density, light weight, and high specific strength. The MAO treatment produced a layer of $2 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thickness with micohardness of $3 5 3 \\mathrm { H V } .$ This layer is mainly composed of ${ \\bf { \\Lambda } } { \\bf { { d - A l } } } _ { 2 } { \\bf { { O } } } _ { 3 }$ and the $\\gamma \\mathrm { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ phases. Micro-hardness of the surface layer increases from 130 to $3 5 3 . 3 \\ \\mathrm { H V } .$ . The load bearing capacity of the MAO coating reduces when the temperature goes up. The MAO treated Al alloy shows a decrease in friction as well as wear at $1 6 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ compared to that at room temperature. The field test has also shown significantly lower wear for MAO treated drilling pipes.\n\nYi et al. [581] have carried out further studies on 2618 aluminium alloy (used for drilling rods in deep well and ultra-deep well drilling) surface treated with muti-arc oxidation (MAO) and also with combined ultrasonic cold forging technology (UCFT) and mutiarc oxidation (MAO) treatments. The compound layer thicknesses are $2 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ MAO layer and $2 0 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ of UCFT treated layer. The micro-hardness values of the sample increased of from 120 to $4 1 5 ~ \\mathrm { H V }$ for MAO layer and from 120 to $1 8 5 ~ \\mathrm { H V }$ for the UCFT layer. Wear rates of combined MAO and UCFT treated aluminium alloy decreased by $7 1 \\%$ at $2 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ .",

The trend remains unchanged till recent years, and there are some interesting developments to be noticed. Over last decades, the combined solution of the Reynolds equation and energy equation for revealing thermal effects has become a routine practice in numerical simulations of lubrication [582, 583]. To address non-Newtonian effects of lubricants, either the Eyring or the CarreauYasuda models have been employed [584–587] despite that there has been a debate over the effectiveness of currently used shear-thinning models. The interplay between body temperature and lubricant rheology has been found to affect film thickness and traction in a complicated way [584]. Transient EHL solutions reveal more details of time-dependent pressure and film thickness under varying speeds or loads [588−591], and contact stiffness and damping have been defined to characterize dynamic responses of lubricating films [592, 593]. Many researchers have tried to integrate multifactorial considerations into one sophisticated numerical model so that the effects resulting from several factors can be analyzed simultaneously [584−588]. While the multifactorial simulations are able to present more realistic results for engineering applications, computational cost rises quickly. On the other hand, fast evaluation of lubrication properties by easy-to-use fitting formulation or by well-trained neural network [583] deserves equal attentions. For example, to estimate rheological and thermal effects on central film thickness, $h _ { \\mathrm { c } } ,$ a fitting formula was proposed by De la Guerra [584] as given in Eq. (4), in which a group of correction factors has been introduced to the Newtonian film thickness $h _ { \\mathrm { N } }$ .\n\n$$\nh _ { \\mathrm { c } } = h _ { \\mathrm { N } } \\cdot \\varphi _ { \\mathrm { N N } } \\cdot \\varphi _ { \\mathrm { S R R } } \\cdot \\varphi _ { \\mathrm { T } }\n$$\n\nwhere $\\varphi _ { \\mathrm { N N } }$ and $\\varphi _ { \\mathsf { S R R } }$ are the factors representing shearthinning effects, under pure rolling and rolling-sliding conditions, respectively, while $\\varphi _ { \\mathrm { { I } } }$ is a correction factor for thermal effect. The expressions for these correction factors have been provided by fitting numerical results.",

Robbe-Valloire [600] proposed a model for mixed lubrication between nominally flat rough surfaces, in which asperity contacts were classified into five different modes of deformation or lubrication, with contact forces in each mode evaluated via corresponding theories. Friction coefficient and the Stribeck curve predicted by this model agree well with experiments. More attentions in recent years have been paid to the effect of artificial surface microstructure called the texture, which could be beneficial to the load carryingcapability if properly designed [601], so efforts have been made to find optimum shape, size, and distribution of micro dimples [602], and a mixed structure combining the texture with wall-slip domain has been investigated, too, as will be discussed in next section.",

As an example, the boundary slippage at solid wall that associates with both lubricant rheology and interfacial property has attracted a lot of attentions. Models such as the Navier slip length, the limiting shear stress, or a combination of both models have been implemented in numerical analysis to capture the wall slip effect [603, 604], and it is recognized that solid-liquid interactions play a significant role in slip behaviour [605]. Zhang et al. [606] recently has proposed a layered slip model for high speed EHL in point contacts, as shown in Fig. 27, assuming that slippage is localized in a thin lubricant layer close to the solid wall, which gives predictions consistent with experiments. The numerical studies on wall slip found potential applications that a proper arrangement of slipping domains or a combination of slipping patch and surface texture would bring about even better load carrying capacity for bearings [605, 607].\n\n[Image]\nFig. 27 Layered slip model proposed by Zhang et al.

In numerical solutions of thin film lubrication when film thickness decreases down to a few nanometers, surface forces due to the van de Waals interactions and electrostatic double layer have to be incorporated [589], and they are found to contribute significantly to the film formation that prevents surfaces from sticking at zero speed. In a recent attempt to model tribochemistry in mixed lubrication, Azam et al. [609] have presented a formula that balances the tribofilm growth described in the Arrhenius equation with film removal obeying an exponential law. Simulation results indicate that tribofilm grows in patchy, inhomogeneous manner within rubbing track, and the mean tribofilm thickness increases with sliding-rolling ratio.",

It was recognized later that the each of the models was in fact suitable for a certain type of material with high or low values of $\\mu ,$ a criterion defined by Tabor, and for the common materials with medium values of $\\mu ,$ the Maugis model, and doubleHertz model were proposed [621]. Recently, Zini et al. [622] has extended the double-Hertz model to the elliptical adhesive contact to account for more general contact geometries. Li and Popov [623] solved the adhesive contacts numerically via the boundary element method (BEM), and generalized the model to the gradient materials, predicting the normal force and contact radius during a pull-off process. In a more recent paper, Wu [624] presents a BEM analysis of adhesive contacts, in which surface interactions are described by the Lennard-Jones potential, and the results of pull-off force and load-approach curve are compared with those from JKR and other existing models.\n\nThe half space assumption in contact models has to be left in the cases when the dimensions of both the contacting bodies are finite since the calculation errors would become significant, especially in the vicinity of the edge. As an example of attempts to develop more accurate theory, a quarter-space model was proposed which converts the contact in quarter space into an equivalent problem in half space plus a group of constraint loads which remain to be determined [625]. Recently, Zhang et al. [626] have extended the quarter space model to the contact in finite-length space, and constructed the matrix equations for solving the unknown constraint loads.

The conjugate gradient method (CGM) has been widely accepted for the minimization, providing that the influence coefficient (IC) or the Green’s function, defined as the response of displacement to a point load, has been obtained in advance. To accelerate the calculation of deformation, fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique has been employed and efforts have been made to further improve its computational efficiency [629]. A numerical scheme known as the Sami-analytical method (SAM) has been developed in last decades, in which the ICs are derived analytically in frequency space and deformations are calculated by the FFT technique. Recent progresses along this approach include acquirement of expressions of the ICs for multilayer materials in contacts and extension of the SAM model to the analysis of thermoelastic contacts of inhomogeneous materials [630, 631]. The newly appeared FFT-based boundary value method [632] is similar to that of SAM, but a new way of computing the coefficients of the conjugate gradient solver has been presented, which reduces the number of FFTs at each step. Other numerical schemes for contact analysis have been developed in parallel with the SAM, including the multiscale theory proposed by Persson [633], the finite element or boundary element method [634], and the approaches based on MD simulations. A recent development of the Green’s function molecular dynamics (GFMD) deserves a brief discussion. It involves a calculation of the renormalized atomic interactions or force constants through the correlation matrix (or Green’s function) of atomic displacement in reciprocal space, and the force constants are thereby to be used in MD simulations [635].",

However, there is no direct verification so far for any of these models. At the time of $5 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ anniversary on the publication of the GW’s classical paper, Müser conducted a brute-force calculation based on GFMD for a contact where a rough surface with a well-defined topography has been pressed on a flat, elastic substrate. He issued a challenge to the contact mechanics community, by inviting scientists around the world to submit solutions to the same problem [637]. The problem definition was posted on a website while the computational results from the challenger were kept secret until all solutions were submitted. The solutions from a dozen research groups were received and summarized in a review paper by Müser and all contributors [638]. The comparison shows that 1) the solutions from the FFTbased boundary value method are the closest to the reference values from Müser’s brute-force calculations, 2) both GFMD and all-atom MD have predicted similar patterns of real contact, which agree well with that measured in experiment as illustrated in Fig. 28, and 3) the Persson’s model also gives predictions in good agreement with the reference when adhesion is not involved [639].

This approach, for example, has been widely applied to simulate sliding wear between rough surfaces in solid contact or mixed lubrication [647−650]. The computation is carried out in two steps, first to calculate the pressure at asperity contact, and then to evaluate wear loss at each contacting spot by locally applying Archard’s law. Since the geometry of worn surface has to be updated at every time step, the computational cost becomes quite expensive, and efforts have been made to speed up or simplify the computation [651]. The model has been further refined by assuming that wear takes place only at the asperities in plastic deformation [652, 653].\n\nSimilar approach has been applied for simulating other types of wear, such as fretting and erosion. For fretting wear, the FEM-based model has been employed to calculated deflection and stress distribution, and the material removal of the solids is estimated by the Archard-type equations, but unlike the sliding wear, the geometry of worn surface due to fretting are updated every $N \\cdot$ -cycle to accelerate calculation [654]. To address the effects of accumulation and abrasion of wear debris, wear particles accumulated between rubbing solids have been modeled as a third body in the form of a thin-continuum layer [655].\n\nErosion is another category of wear that has attracted great attentions. The material loss caused by the impact of fluid-carried solid particles has been numerically investigated in a two-step approach. First, the fluid-particle flow is simulated by means of a multiphase model, in which the fluid flow is represented in Eulerian, cell-based framework, whilst the solid particle trajectory is described by Lagrangian equation of motion, and commercial software based on FEM or CFD is available and applied for solving these equations [656−659]. Afterwards, the wear volume is estimated by erosion models or empirical-based equations that express material removal of substrate as a function of velocity and angle of impacting particles [660, 661]. Efforts have been made to constitute more accurate model for the material loss due to erosion [662]. The impacting particles used to be assumed as rigid spheres, but the effects of particle shape and elasticity on erosion have been investigated by using deformable and irregular shape particles [663].\n\nThe second strategy deals with another tape of wear, in which material is removed particle-by-particle in a discrete way, and the simulations have to be carried out in a discrete approach to be discussed in Section 6.4.2.",

It was originally aimed to simulate granular materials, but also found to be very useful for investigating the response of bulk materials. The idea is to convert the continuum material into a system consisting of discrete elements or particles, each of which represents a small volume of material and obeys the classical equation of motion so that the material response can be predicted by computing particle movements.\n\nFor discrete simulation of wear, however, there is a particular issue to be clarified first, i.e., how a wear particle is generated during contact and sliding, and when it detaches from substrate. In other words, it requires a material rupture criterion to model the formation and detachment of wear particles. Numerous criteria have been proposed, including the critical accumulated dissipated energy, critical accumulated plastic strain, critical accumulated damage, critical Von Misses stress, and their variants [664].\n\nMany years ago, Rabinowicz [665] presented a criterion for the minimum size of the wear particle formed in adhesive wear due to the interplay of adhesion and plastic deformation. This mechanism of wear particle generation has been brought to a new attention recently [666], attributing to a series of MD simulations by Molinari et al. [225], which will be further discussed in Section 6.5.1. Popov and Pohrt [226] have recapitulated the Rabinowicz criterion and implemented a numerical approach based on this concept to simulate adhesive wear and evolution of surface topography. Figure 29 gives their simulation result for contact configuration and corresponding energy density from which the location and size of wear particle can be estimated.\n\nThe discrete method has been successfully applied to calculate material removals caused by adhesive wear [667], abrasive cutting [668], and erosion. In DEM simulations of erosion, for example, the substrate materials have been discretized into elements or particles, the impact-caused damage, and removal of the target material can be predicted numerically, through the mesh-dependent FEM [669], the mesh-free method of smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) [670, 671] or the finite volume particle method (FVPM) [663]. Figure 30 illustrates a typical discrete erosion model, in which a rigid particle collides with the target block that consists of uniformly distributed nodes each representing a volume of material.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 29 (a) Contact configuration and (b) the corresponding energy density map for a given diameter $D$ .

In this approach, the mutual influences between fretting wear and fretting fatigue have been investigated [674].\n\nThe chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP), as one of key techniques in production of integrated circuit chips, has attracted great attentions, and numerical analysis becomes a popular way to predict material removal. The simulations have been carried out either by combining FEM calculation of contact stress with the Archard wear model [675], or in a discrete approach based on the SPH model [676], but the difficulty lies in incorporating the role of chemical reaction. In a recent development, the chemical effect has been taken into account by modeling formation and removal of tribofilm, which may provide a useful clue to the CMP simulations [677].\n\nNumerical simulations have found broad applications in many areas of engineering for predicting wear of various components, including wheel-rail pairs [678], cutting tools [679], artificial joints [680], and bearings [681], etc.",

To investigate this critical issue, Aghababaei et al. [685, 686] have carried out a series of quasi-MD simulations. They have revealed that the adhesive wear mechanism is controlled by a characteristic length scale, and proposed a model where bigger junctions produce wear debris by fracture while smaller ones smoothen out plastically (Fig. 31(a)). It is also found that the debris volume is proportional to the tangential work, i.e., the product of tangential force and sliding distance (Fig. 31(b)) [687].\n\n[Image]\nFig. 31 Summary of atomic simulation results with different asperity size, shape, material hardness, interfacial adhesion, applied load, sliding velocity, and boundary conditions.

In another molecular dynamics study, it is proposed that the debris generation could be considered as a chemical reaction, while its thermodynamic efficiency increases from $5 \\%$ to $5 0 \\%$ as the wear transits from mild to severe [230]. In addition to the studies of wear debris generation, MD simulations on nanoscale wear used to be carried out in a more straightforward way. For instance, the configuration of a particle or a tool-tip sliding over substrate has been adopted for simulating micro-cutting [689], mechanical polishing, and abrasive/adhesive wear of bulk materials [690, 691].\n\nAnother topic in simulations concerns atomic-scale wear of graphene and other 2D materials. The simulations of nanoscale wear of few-layer graphene have revealed the important role of adhesive interaction between the tip and graphene [692]. MD simulations of indentation on bare and graphene-covered Pt (111) surfaces show that covering surfaces with a graphene layer will mitigate the effect of roughness on contact properties [693]. Through simulations of the contact and scratch between a tip and substrate, Xu et al. [694] have proposed a strategy to suppress the nanoscale wear via coating graphene layers on both sides of sliding surfaces. The enhanced wear resistance is attributed to the reduction of local fluctuation of contact pressure and the weakening interactions across the interface (Fig. 32(a)). Despite the excellent mechanical properties of 2D materials discovered in microscale, they are vulnerable in macroscopic tribology test, and MD simulations have been carried out to understand the paradox. It is revealed that graphene is much easier to be damaged at the step edge, a kind of defects ubiquitous for 2D materials at the macroscale (Fig. 32(b)) [695], and the wear resistance at the step edge is found dependent on humidity, as the dangling bonds at the step edge could be passivated by water molecules (Fig. 32(c)) [696]. The grain boundaries (GBs) on graphene are also responsible for the deterioration of wear resistance, as Zhang et al. have proposed [697]. Their simulation results show that the impacts on the wear resistance associate with the GBs orientation and the strength of interactions between graphene and substrate (Fig. 32(d)).\n\n[Image]\nFig. 32 (a) Pressure distributions for a diamond tip with or without coated graphene layers in contact with substrate.

Using the ReaxFFMD simulations, for example, it is revealed that the formation and shear of interfacial bridge bonds lead to atom-by-atom removal of substrate materials, and the effect of tribochemical reactions caused by water molecules or OH groups has been investigated [699–701]. The water assisted wear of silicon-based materials has been investigated via first-principle MD simulations by Ootani et al. [702], showing that a small amount of water will promote the tribochemical wear while large amount of water will suppress the wear due to the formation of water film. A full ab initio MD simulation has been performed to study the mechanism of iron phosphide tribofilm formation under the conditions of sliding and compressing of interfaces [703].",

      "content": "An unsolved problem in MD simulations results from the difficulty in precise description of the interfacial interactions. As a solution to the difficulty, the first principle (ab initio) computations have appeared in nanotribology studies [704], which start directly from the fundamental laws of physics, without involving any empirical model or fitting parameter, so that atomic interactions at interfaces can be calculated accurately. Restuccia et al. [705] have released a high throughput first principles computational protocol to calculate two intrinsic tribological properties, i.e., the adhesion energy and shear strength of solid interface, which are crucial for understanding the origin of adhesion and static friction. Besides, the potential energy surface (PES) or landscape, associating with the energy barrier in sliding friction, is also a major concern in the first principle study with a special interest in the correlation between the PES and electronic structure. For example, in a first principle study on various types of van der Waals hetero-structure, the PES corrugation is found to be determined by the sliding induced interfacial charge density fluctuation (Figs. 33(a) and 33(b)) [29]. Gao et al. [706] have studied the frictional behaviors of Ir and Au tips sliding on graphene/Ni substrate, revealing that the strong electron orbital hybridizations between the tip and the substrate will lead to abnormal frictional properties, including a negative friction coefficient (Fig. 33(c)). A further computational study has clarified that the moiré superlattice-scale frictional modulation, observed when a tip slides over a graphene covered substrate of transition metal, originates from the electronic state overlaps caused by the joint effects of tip-graphene and graphene-substrate interactions [707]. Shi et al. [708], on the other hand, have reported that the moiré superlattice scale stick-slip could be attributed to the large sliding energy barrier arising from the morphological corrugation of graphene on Ru (0001) substrate (Fig. 33(d)), suggesting another mechanism that the PES and sliding friction may also depend on the atomic architecture at the interface.\n\nThe dependence of frictional behavior on the interfacial atomic architecture and morphological corrugation has been confirmed by independent studies. Yang et al. [709] have elucidated the roles of structural defects and water adsorption in the running-in process, showing that the chemisorption of $\\scriptstyle \\mathrm { H , }$ O, and OH at the defect sites will reduce the interlayer binding energy of bilayer graphene, which accounts for the coefficient of friction reduction of graphene sliding under humid environments. A recent DFT calculation indicates that the atomic scale topography and corresponding potential corrugation would be affected by chemical modifications, e.g., when a fluorinated h-BN layer slides against fluorinated h-BN/Ni (111) substrate, a smooth potential corrugation is obtained [710]. Computations have also been carried out to investigate the evolution of atomic structure during sliding, the possibility to control the interfacial architecture, and to detect the mechanism of tribochemical reactions [711].\n\n[Image]\nFig. 33 (a) Mapping the PES corrugation $( \\Delta E )$ and interfacial charge density fluctuation for the $\\mathrm { G r / G r }$ and $\\mathrm { G r } / \\mathrm { M o S } _ { 2 }$ systems in sliding.

For example, a computational study shows that molybdenum and tungsten dioxides exhibit better lubricity and higher mechanical strength in comparison to the widely used disulfides [26]. Two research groups [712, 713] have studied the frictional properties of Mxenes, a 2D material which has recently aroused widespread interest, proving that they are promising lubricating materials with low and controllable sliding energy barrier and excellent mechanical properties. Another kind of 2D material, layered electride ${ \\mathrm { C a } } _ { 2 } { \\mathrm { N } } ,$ has also been found to be a potential solid lubricant, exhibiting strong interlayer binding interactions but low interlayer friction due to the homogeneous conduction electrons distribution [714].",

      "content": "A difficulty in computer simulations of tribological process remains due to lack of a proper multiscale model to handle the complex multiscale and multiphysical phenomena [704]. The quasi-continuum (QC) method, which integrates the molecular dynamics and the finite element method, has been a widely employed approach to carry out multiscale simulations. Using the QC method, for example, Zhu et al. [715] have simulated the process of copper chemical mechanical polishing to investigate the effect of particle size on the quality, plastic deformation, and residual stress of the workpiece. A similar approach has been employed to study the friction and scratch characteristics of textured and rough surfaces of pure aluminum [716]. Another example involves the use of coupled multiscale DEM–FEM method to investigate the tire-pavement friction [717].\n\nBesides, some methods described in previous sections can be classified as multiscale approaches. For instance, the ab initial MD simulation in Section 6.5.1 is in fact a multiscale method that directly couples the first principle computation with MD simulation [702, 703]. The DEM is another way to cross over different scales since each element or particle represents a small volume of material consisting of a group of atoms, which enables to simulate a much larger system [671]. There is an implicit strategy for multiscale analysis, i.e., making use of a certain type of formulation to transfer the information from small scale calculation up to the larger scale investigation. Examples include the potential functions and reactive force fields which are obtained from the first principle study and to be used in MD simulations [718], or a description of lubricant property formulated from MD simulations to be applied in fluid mechanics. For example, Savio et al. [719] have conducted a multiscale study that extracts a formulation from MD simulations to describe the dependence of the slip length on velocity, film thickness, and pressure, and the formulation is coupled with the modified Reynolds equation to investigate the wall slip effect in nanometerthick lubricant films.\n\nThere is a symposium on the multiscale materials modeling (MMM) conference every two years, presenting the most cutting-edge researches in tribology simulations. In 2018, the symposium was held at Osaka, Japan, and organized by Prof. Kubo and his co-chairs [720]. Despite various multiscale approaches have been proposed, researchers are still unsatisfied and keep looking for a better solution, which characterizes the target and demands in future studies of computer simulations.",

      "content": "This review pertaining to advances has shown that tribology research activities have seen rapid growth in recent times and the reach of tribology is expanding beyond the conventional domains. The salient concluding remarks pertaining to different themes of research reviewed are as follows:\n\n1) Researches on superlubricity with DLC coatings, graphene, other emerging 2D materials, and new additives are expanding rapidly recent years. In the future, novel mechanisms of superlubricity need to be explored to extend the scope of this area. Exploring the lower limit of friction coefficient by using equipment with higher sensitivity in force detection and precise control of experimental conditions. New material systems such as the plant-derived compounds and polymers, two-dimensional metal nitrides or carbides with higher quality should be developed. The dispersancy of inorganic materials in lubricating oil is the primary factor restricting their application in lubrication. There is thus an urgent need to develop versatile and environment-friendly methods to overcome this hindrance as well as to develop technologies to use recycled nanomaterials so as to minimize the wastage of limited material resources. To achieve superlubricity at larger scales is important for potential applications in industries. There should also be greater emphasis on cleaning and reuse of the used lubricating oil in future.\n\n2) Research on wear of materials is mainly driven by strong industrial demands on higher reliability and longer lifetime of a variety of products. Zero or near zero wear has been pursuing for many MEMS/ NEMS devices, small scale, and precision mechanical systems. Besides lubrication technology, developing and application of new composited materials, antiwear coatings, and surface modifications is the trend for improvement of wear resistance of materials. Meanwhile, on-line oil analysis and condition monitoring technologies are expected to further develop along with the rapid progress in technologies of information, networking, big data, and artificial intelligence.\n\n3) The recent biotribology covers a wide range of topics. While it is important to develop further research in each specific area, it is equally important to examine generic issues and underlying mechanisms. A number of similarities, either from materials or methodologies points of view can be found and this will help further develop the research in biotribology. Applications of the most up to date research in tribology will be important as well as extending biotribology research beyond common engineering disciplines.\n\n4) High temperature tribology research activities transcend various scientific disciplines and are rapidly growing. The fundamental understanding of high temperature tribological processes is still inadequate and there are hardly any models to reliably predict friction and wear at elevated temperatures. The major thrust of current research work has been in developing materials and surface modification technologies for controlling friction and wear at high temperatures. There has been significant progress in this direction and the quest for effectively controlling friction and wear in different applications will continue. Both experimentation as well as modelling pertaining to friction and wear processes are difficult and there is need to develop new techniques and tools to solve high temperature tribological problems.\n\n5) Numerical analysis of lubrication has significantly matured but efforts would continue in developing more comprehensive models or new numerical schemes. Most studies are expected to be orientated to applications. The impressive number of publications and various numerical approaches suggest that there is a quite room for developing computer simulations in contact mechanics. Numerical simulations of wear are still in an early age of development. There is no fundamental theory for accurate prediction of wear, the combination of lubrication/contact analysis with the Archard equation is only a temporary solution, and there is a long way to go in refining the DEM-based approaches. MD simulations and the first principle calculations have become the fastest growing research area in recent decades, but the current capability of computer hardware has greatly limited the space and time scale of simulation, and scientists are trying very hard to pursue an approach for multiscale simulation, but the progress so far is not impressive enough.",
