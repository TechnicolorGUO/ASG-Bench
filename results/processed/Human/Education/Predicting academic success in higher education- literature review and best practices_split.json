Early detection of students at risk, along with preventive measures, can drastically improve their success. Lately, machine learning techniques have been extensively used for prediction purpose. While there is a plethora of success stories in the literature, these techniques are mainly accessible to “computer science”, or more precisely, “artificial intelligence” literate educators. Indeed, the effective and efficient application of data mining methods entail many decisions, ranging from how to define student’s success, through which student attributes to focus on, up to which machine learning method is more appropriate to the given problem. This study aims to provide a step-by-step set of guidelines for educators willing to apply data mining techniques to predict student success. For this, the literature has been reviewed, and the state-of-the-art has been compiled into a systematic process, where possible decisions and parameters are comprehensively covered and explained along with arguments. This study will provide to educators an easier access to data mining techniques, enabling all the potential of their application to the field of education.",

      "content": "Computers have become ubiquitous, especially in the last three decades, and are significantly widespread. This has led to the collection of vast volumes of heterogeneous data, which can be utilized for discovering unknown patterns and trends (Han et al., 2011), as well as hidden relationships (Sumathi & Sivanandam, 2006), using data mining techniques and tools (Fayyad & Stolorz, 1997). The analysis methods of data mining can be roughly categorized as: 1) classical statistics methods (e.g. regression analysis, discriminant analysis, and cluster analysis) (Hand, 1998), 2) artificial intelligence (Zawacki-Richter, Marín, Bond, & Gouverneur, 2019) (e.g. genetic algorithms, neural computing, and fuzzy logic), and 3) machine learning (e.g. neural networks, symbolic learning, and swarm optimization) (Kononenko & Kukar, 2007). The latter consists of a combination of advanced statistical methods and AI heuristics. These techniques can benefit various fields through different objectives, such as extracting patterns, predicting behavior, or describing trends. A standard data mining process starts by integrating raw data – from different data sources – which is cleaned to remove noise, duplicated or inconsistent data. After that, the cleaned data is transformed into a concise format that can be understood by data mining tools, through filtering and aggregation techniques. Then, the analysis step identifies the existing interesting patterns, which can be displayed for a better visualization (Han et al., 2011) (Fig. 1).\n\nRecently data mining has been applied to various fields like healthcare (Kavakiotis et al., 2017), business (Massaro, Maritati, & Galiano, 2018), and also education (Adekitan, 2018). Indeed, the development of educational database management systems created a large number of educational databases, which enabled the application of data mining to extract useful information from this data. This led to the emergence of Education Data Mining (EDM) (Calvet Liñán & Juan Pérez, 2015; Dutt, Ismail, & Herawan, 2017) as an independent research field. Nowadays, EDM plays a significant role in discovering patterns of knowledge about educational phenomena and the learning process (Anoopkumar & Rahman, 2016), including understanding performance (Baker, 2009). Especially, data mining has been used for predicting a variety of crucial educational outcomes, like performance (Xing, 2019), retention (Parker, Hogan, Eastabrook, Oke, & Wood, 2006), success (Martins, Miguéis, Fonseca, & Alves, 2019; Richard-Eaglin, 2017), satisfaction (Alqurashi, 2019), achievement (Willems, Coertjens, Tambuyzer, & Donche, 2018), and dropout rate (Pérez, Castellanos, & Correal, 2018).\n\nThe process of EDM (see Fig. 2) is an iterative knowledge discovery process that consists of hypothesis formulation, testing, and refinement (Moscoso-Zea et al., 2016; Sarala & Krishnaiah, 2015). Despite many publications, including case studies, on educational data mining, it is still difficult for educators – especially if they are a novice to the field of data mining – to effectively apply these techniques to their specific academic problems. Every step described in Fig. 2 necessitates several decisions and set-up of parameters, which directly affect the quality of the obtained result.\n\nThis study aims to fill the described gap, by providing a complete guideline, providing easier access to data mining techniques and enabling all the potential of their application to the field of education. In this study, we specifically focus on the problem of predicting the academic success of students in higher education. For this, the state-ofthe-art has been compiled into a systematic process, where all related decisions and parameters are comprehensively covered and explained along with arguments.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 1 standard data mining process (Han et al. 2011)\n\n[Image]\nFig. 2 Knowledge discovery process in educational institutions (Moscoso-Zea, Andres-Sampedro, & Lujan-Mora, 2016)\n\nIn the following, first, section 2 clarifies what is academic success and how it has been defined and measured in various studies with a focus on the factors that can be used for predicting academic success. Then, section 3 presents the methodology adopted for the literature review. Section 4 reviews data mining techniques used in predicting students’ academic success, and compares their predictive accuracy based on various case studies. Section 5 concludes the review, with a recapitulation of the whole process. Finally, section 6 concludes this paper and outlines the future work.",

      "content": "Student success is a crucial component of higher education institutions because it is considered as an essential criterion for assessing the quality of educational institutions (National Commission for Academic Accreditation &amp, 2015). There are several definitions of student success in the literature. In (Kuh, Kinzie, Buckley, Bridges, & Hayek, 2006), a definition of student success is synthesized from the literature as “Student success is defined as academic achievement, engagement in educationally purposeful activities, satisfaction, acquisition of desired knowledge, skills and competencies, persistence, attainment of educational outcomes, and post-college performance”. While this is a multi-dimensional definition, authors in (York, Gibson, & Rankin, 2015) gave an amended definition concentrating on the most important six components, that is to say “Academic achievement, satisfaction, acquisition of skills and competencies, persistence, attainment of learning objectives, and career success” (Fig. 3).\n\nDespite reports calling for more detailed views of the term, the bulk of published researchers measure academic success narrowly as academic achievement. Academic achievement itself is mainly based on Grade Point Average (GPA), or Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) (Parker, Summerfeldt, Hogan, & Majeski, 2004), which are grade systems used in universities to assign an assessment scale for students’ academic performance (Choi, 2005), or grades (Bunce & Hutchinson, 2009). The academic success has also been defined related to students’ persistence, also called academic resilience (Finn & Rock, 1997), which in turn is also mainly measured through the grades and GPA, measures of evaluations by far the most widely available in institutions.\n\n[Image]\nFig. 3 Defining academic success and its measurements (York et al., 2015)",

      "content": "One important decision related to the prediction of students’ academic success in higher education is to clearly define what is academic success. After that, one can think about the potential influential factors, which are dictating the data that needs to be collected and mined.\n\nWhile a broad variety of factors have been investigated in the literature with respect to their impact on the prediction of students’ academic success (Fig. 4), we focus here on prioracademic achievement, student demographics, $e$ -learning activity, psychological attributes, and environments, as our investigation revealed that they are the most commonly reported factors (summarized in Table 1). As a matter of fact, the top 2 factors, namely, prior-academic achievement, and student demographics, were presented in $6 9 \\%$ of the research papers. This observation is aligned with the results of The previous literature review which emphasized that the grades of internal assessment and CGPA are the most common factors used to predict student performance in EDM (Shahiri, Husain, & Rashid, 2015). With more than $4 0 \\%$ , prior academic achievement is the most important factor. This is basically the historical baggage of students. It is commonly identified as grades (or any other academic performance indicators) that students obtained in the past (pre-university data, and university-data). The pre-university data includes high school results that help understand the consistency in students’ performance (Anuradha & Velmurugan, 2015; Asif et al., 2015; Asif et al., 2017; Garg, 2018; Mesarić & Šebalj, 2016; Mohamed & Waguih, 2017; Singh & Kaur, 2016). They also provide insight into their interest in different topics (i.e., courses grade (Asif et al., 2015; Asif et al., 2017; Oshodi et al., 2018; Singh & Kaur, 2016)). Additionally, this can also include preadmission data which is the university entrance test results (Ahmad et al., 2015; Mesarić & Šebalj, 2016; Oshodi et al., 2018). The university-data consists of grades already obtained by the students since entering the university, including semesters GPA or CGPA (Ahmad et al., 2015; Almarabeh, 2017; Hamoud et al., 2018; Mueen et al., 2016; Singh & Kaur, 2016), courses marks (Al-barrak & Al-razgan, 2016; Almarabeh, 2017; Anuradha & Velmurugan, 2015; Asif et al., 2015; Asif et al., 2017; Hamoud et al., 2018; Mohamed & Waguih, 2017;\n\n[Image]\nFig. 4 a broad variety of factors potentially impacting the prediction of students’ academic success\n\nTable 1 Most influential factors on the prediction of students’ academic success\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Factor Category</td><td>Factor Description</td><td>References</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Prior Academic Achievement</td><td>Pre-university data: high school background (i.e., high school results), pre-admission data (e.g.admission test results) University-data: semester GPA or CGPA, individual course letter marks, and individual assessment grades</td><td>(Adekitan &amp; Salau,2019;Ahmad, Ismail,&amp; Aziz,2015; Al-barrak &amp; Al-razgan,2016; Almarabeh,2017; Anuradha &amp; Velmurugan,2015; Asif, Merceron,Abbas,&amp; Ghani,2017; Asif, Merceron,&amp; Pathan,2015; Garg,2018; Hamoud, Hashim,&amp; Awadh,2018; Mesaric&amp;Sebalj,2016;Mohamed&amp; Waguih,2017; Mueen,Zafar,&amp; Manzoor, 2016; Oshodi, Aigbavboa, Aluko, Daniel, &amp; Abisuga, 2018; Singh &amp; Kaur, 2016; Sivasakthi,2017; Yassein, Helali,&amp;</td><td>44%</td></tr><tr><td>Student Demographics</td><td>Gender,age,race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (i.e., parents&#x27; education and occupation, place of residence /traveled distance, family size,and family income).</td><td>Mohomad, 2017) (Ahmad et al., 2015; Anuradha &amp; Velmurugan,2015; Garg,2018; Hamoud et al., 2018; Mohamed &amp; Waguih,2017; Mueen et al.,2016; Putpuek, Rojanaprasert, Atchariyachanvanich,&amp; Thamrongthanyawong,2018;</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td>Students&#x27; Environment</td><td>Class type,semester duration, type of program</td><td>Singh &amp; Kaur, 2016; Sivasakthi,2017) (Adekitan&amp; Salau,2019; Ahmad et al., 2015; Hamoud et al., 2018; Mesaric &amp; Sebalj,2016; Mohamed&amp;Waguih,2017;</td><td>17%</td></tr><tr><td>Psychological</td><td>Student interest, behavior of study, stress,anxiety, time of preoccupation, self-regulation,and motivation.</td><td>Mueen et al., 2016) (Garg,2018; Hamoud et al., 2018; Mueen et al., 2016; Putpuek et al., 2018)</td><td>11%</td></tr><tr><td>Student E-learning Activity</td><td>Number of logins times, number of tasks, number of tests,assessment activities, number of discussion board entries,number/total time material viewed</td><td>(Mueen et al., 2016)</td><td>3%</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nMueen et al., 2016; Singh & Kaur, 2016; Sivasakthi, 2017) and course assessment grades (e.g. assignment (Almarabeh, 2017; Anuradha & Velmurugan, 2015; Mueen et al., 2016; Yassein et al., 2017); quizzes (Almarabeh, 2017; Anuradha & Velmurugan, 2015; Mohamed & Waguih, 2017; Yassein et al., 2017); lab-work (Almarabeh, 2017; Mueen et al., 2016; Yassein et al., 2017); and attendance (Almarabeh, 2017; Anuradha & Velmurugan, 2015; Garg, 2018; Mueen et al., 2016; Putpuek et al., 2018; Yassein et al., 2017)).\n\nStudents’ demographic is a topic of divergence in the literature. Several studies indicated its impact on students’ success, for example, gender (Ahmad et al., 2015; Almarabeh, 2017; Anuradha & Velmurugan, 2015; Garg, 2018; Hamoud et al., 2018; Mohamed & Waguih, 2017; Putpuek et al., 2018; Sivasakthi, 2017), age (Ahmad et al., 2015; Hamoud et al., 2018; Mueen et al., 2016), race/ethnicity (Ahmad et al., 2015), socioeconomic status (Ahmad et al., 2015; Anuradha & Velmurugan, 2015; Garg, 2018; Hamoud et al., 2018; Mohamed & Waguih, 2017; Mueen et al., 2016; Putpuek et al., 2018), and father’s and mother’s background (Hamoud et al., 2018; Mohamed & Waguih, 2017; Singh & Kaur, 2016) have been shown to be important. Yet, few studies also reported just the opposite, for gender in particular (Almarabeh, 2017; Garg, 2018).\n\nSome attributes related to the student’s environment were found to be impactful information such as program type (Hamoud et al., 2018; Mohamed & Waguih, 2017), class type (Mueen et al., 2016; Sivasakthi, 2017) and semester period (Mesarić & Šebalj, 2016).\n\nAmong the reviewed papers, also many researchers used Student E-learning Activity information, such as a number of login times, number of discussion board entries, number $/$ total time material viewed (Hamoud et al., 2018), as influential attributes and their impact, though minor, were reported.\n\nThe psychological attributes are determined as the interests and personal behavior of the student; several studies have shown them to be impactful on students’ academic success. To be more precise, student interest (Hamoud et al., 2018), the behavior towards study (Hamoud et al., 2018; Mueen et al., 2016), stress and anxiety (Hamoud et al., 2018; Putpuek et al., 2018), self-regulation and time of preoccupation (Garg, 2018; Hamoud et al., 2018), and motivation (Mueen et al., 2016), were found to influence success.",

One can observe two main approaches in term of the model to build: classification where CGPA that is targeted is a category as multi class problem such as (a letter grade (Adekitan & Salau, 2019; Asif et al., 2015; Asif et al., 2017) or overall rating (Al-barrak & Al-razgan, 2016; Putpuek et al., 2018)) or binary class problem such as (pass/fail (Hamoud et al., 2018; Oshodi et al., 2018)). As for the other approach, it is the regression where the numerical value of CGPA is predicted (Asif et al., 2017). We can also observe a broad variety in terms of the department students belongs to, from architecture (Oshodi et al., 2018), to education (Putpuek et al., 2018), with a majority in technical fields (Adekitan & Salau, 2019; Al-barrak & Al-razgan, 2016; Asif et al., 2015; Hamoud et al., 2018). An interesting finding is related to predictors: studies that included university-data, especially grades from first 2 years of the program, yielded better performance than studies that included only demographics (Putpuek et al., 2018), or only pre-university data (Oshodi et al., 2018).

In that case, this could either be deduced from existing data, or it might be directly acquired from students through surveys. Similarly, students’ environment related information also can be extracted from the SIS, while psychological data would probably need the student to fill a survey.

When a value is not stored for a variable, it is considered as missing data. When a value is in an abnormal distance from the other values in the dataset, it is called an outlier. Literature reveals that missing values and outliers are very common in the field of EDM. Thus, it is important to know how to handle them without compromising the quality of the prediction. All things considered, dealing with missing values or outliers cannot be done by a general procedure, and several methods need to be considered within the context of the problem. Nevertheless, we try to here to summarize the main approaches observed in the literature and Table 7 provides a succinct summary of them.\n\nIf not treated, missing value becomes a problem for some classifiers. For example, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Neural Networks (NN), Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression require full observation (Pelckmans, De Brabanter, Suykens, & De Moor,\n\n[Image]\nFig. 6 Initial Preparation of Data\n\nTable 6 Data Selection\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Methods</td><td>When to use</td><td>Advantages</td><td>Disadvantages</td></tr><tr><td>Vertical selection</td><td>To remove redundant or irrelevant features</td><td>Facilitate understanding of the extracted pattern and rises the speed of the learning stage</td><td>Requires a good understanding of the data domain</td></tr><tr><td>Horizontal selection</td><td>To remove redundant and/or conflicting instances</td><td>Enhance the quality of input data, thus enable improved performance of DM models</td><td>In descriptive analysis,it is best to have as many instances as possible.</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n2005; Salman & Vomlel, 2017; Schumacker, 2012), however, decision trees and random forests can handle missing data (Aleryani, Wang, De, & Iglesia, 2018). There are two strategies to deal with missing values. The first one is a listwise deletion, and it consists in deleting either the record (row deletion, when missing values are few) or the attribute/variable (column deletion, when missing values are too many). The second strategy, imputation, that derives the missing value from the remainder of the data (e.g. median, mean, a constant value for numerical value, or randomly selected value from missing values distribution (McCarthy, McCarthy, Ceccucci, & Halawi, 2019; Nisbet et al., 2009)).\n\nTable 7 Data Cleaning\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Missing</td><td>Strategies</td><td>Methods</td><td>Cases</td><td>Advantaged</td><td>Disadvantages</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\">data</td><td>Listwise deletion</td><td>Instance/row deletion</td><td>Records contain few missing values</td><td>Does not affect the ability of the prediction model if the size of data set is large</td><td>Affects the ability of the prediction model if the size of data set is small</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Feature/column deletion</td><td>Column contain too many missing values</td><td>Does not affect the ability of the prediction model if the size of data set is large</td><td>Affects the ability of the prediction model if the number of attributes is small</td></tr><tr><td>Imputation (Replacement)</td><td>Numeric values: (median or mean) of the student, Nominal values: (mode) of the</td><td>Missing data such as grade or marks</td><td>Preserve the data</td><td>Can introduce bias in the analysis</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>student.

Once identified, outliers can be removed from the modeling data. Another possibility is to converts the numeric variable to a categorical variable (i.e. bin the data) or leaves the outliers in the data (McCarthy et al., 2019).",

If taken as it is, a student’s GPA reflects his/her average in a given semester. However, this does not explicitly say anything about this student’s trend over several semesters. For the same GPA, one student could be in a steady state, going through an increasing trend, or experiencing a drastic performance drop. Thus, calculating the difference in GPA between consecutive semesters will add an extra information.

      "content": "Data transformation is a necessary process to eliminate dissimilarities in the dataset, thus it becomes more appropriate for data mining (Osborne, 2002). In EDM for success prediction, we can observe the following operations:\n\n1. Normalization of numeric attributes: this is a scaling technique used when the data includes varying scales, and the used data mining algorithm cannot provide a clear assumptions of the data distribution (Patro & Sahu, 2015). We can cite K-nearest neighbors and artificial neural networks (How to Normalize and Standardize Your Machine Learning Data in Weka, n.d.) as examples of such algorithms. Normalizing the data may improve the accuracy and the efficiency of the mining algorithms, and provide better results (Shalabi & Al-Kasasbeh, 2006). The common normalization techniques are min-max (MM), decimal scaling, Z-score (ZS), median and MAD, double sigmoid (DS), tanh, and bi-weight normalizations (Kabir, Ahmad, & Swamy, 2015).\n2. Discretization: The simplest method of discretization binning (García et al., 2015), converts a continuous numeric variable into a series of categories by creating a finite number of bins and assigning a specific number of values to each attribute in each bin. Discretization is a necessary step when using DM techniques that allow only for categorical variables (Liu, Hussain, Tan, & Dash, 2002; Maimon & Rokach,\n2005) such as C4.5 (Quinlan, 2014), Apriori (Agrawal, 2005) and Naïve Bayes (Flores, Gámez, Martínez, & Puerta, 2011). Discretization also increases the accuracy of the models by overcoming noisy data, and by identifying outliers’ values. Finally, discrete features are easier to understand, handle, and explain.\n3. Convert to numeric variables: Most DM algorithms offer better results using a numeric variable. Therefore, data needs to be converted into numerical variables, using any of these methods: a. Encode labels using a value between [0 and $\\mathrm { N } _ { ( \\mathrm { c l a s s - 1 } ) 3 4 } ]$ where $_ \\mathrm { N }$ is the number of labels (Why One-Hot Encode Data in Machine Learning, n.d.). b.

This is done by simply combining similar levels into alike groups through domain (Simple Methods to deal with Categorical Variables in Predictive Modeling, n.d.).\n\nHowever, note that all these methods do not necessarily lead to improved results. Therefore, it is important to repeat the modeling process by trying different preprocessing scenarios, evaluate the performance of the model, and identify the best results.

Feature selection aims to choose a subset of attributes from the input data with the capability of giving an efficient description for the input data while reducing effects from unrelated variables while preserving sufficient prediction results (Guyon & Elisseeff, 2003). Feature selection enables reduced computation time, improved prediction performance while allowing a better understanding of the data (Chandrashekar & Sahin, 2014). Feature selection methods are classified into filter and wrapper methods (Kohavi & John, 1997). Filter methods work as preprocessing to rank the features, so high-ranking features are identified and applied to the predictor. In wrapper methods, the criterion for selecting the feature is the performance of the forecasting device, meaning that the predictor is wrapped on a search algorithm which will find a subset that gives the highest predictor performance. Moreover, there are embedded methods (Blum & Langley, 1997; Guyon & Elisseeff, 2003; P. (Institute for the S. of L. and E. Langley, 1994) which include variable selection as part of the training process without the need for splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Predictive models apply supervised learning functions to provide estimation for expected values of dependent variables according to the features of relevant independent variables (Bramer, 2016). Descriptive models are used to produce patterns that describe the fundamental structure, relations, and interconnectedness of the mined data by applying unsupervised learning functions on it (Peng, Kou, Shi, & Chen, 2008). Typical examples of predictive models are classification (Umadevi & Marseline, 2017) and regression (Bragança, Portela, & Santos, 2018), while clustering (Dutt et al., 2017) and association (Zhang, Niu, Li, & Zhang, 2018), produce descriptive models. As stated in section 4, classification is the most used method, followed by regression and clustering. The most commonly used classification techniques are Bayesian networks, neural networks, decision trees (Romero & Ventura, 2010). Common regression techniques are linear regression and logistic regression analysis (Siguenza-Guzman, Saquicela, Avila-Ordóñez, Vandewalle, & Cattrysse, 2015). Clustering uses techniques like neural networks, Kmeans algorithms, fuzzy clustering and discrimination analysis (Dutt et al., 2017).

Then, the algorithms to build the models are chosen from the 10 techniques considered as the top 10 in DM in terms of performance, always prefer models that are interpretable and understandable such as DT and linear models (Wu et al., 2008). Once the algorithms have been chosen, they require to be configured before they are applied. The user must provide suitable values for the parameters in advance in order to obtain good results for the models. There are various strategies to tune parameters for EDM algorithms, used to find the most useful performing parameters. The trial and error approach is one of the simplest and easiest methods for non-expert users (Ruano, Ribes, Sin, Seco, & Ferrer, 2010). It consists of performing numerous experiments by modifying the parameters’ values until finding the most beneficial performing parameters.",

      "content": "Early student performance prediction can help universities to provide timely actions, like planning for appropriate training to improve students’ success rate. Exploring educational data can certainly help in achieving the desired educational goals. By applying EDM techniques, it is possible to develop prediction models to improve student success. However, using data mining techniques can be daunting and challenging for nontechnical persons. Despite the many dedicated software’s, this is still not a straightforward process, involving many decisions. This study presents a clear set of guidelines to follow for using EDM for success prediction. The study was limited to undergraduate level, however the same principles can be easily adapted to graduate level. It has been prepared for those people who are novice in data mining, machine learning or artificial intelligence.\n\nTable 15 Performance Metrics for classification problem\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Performance measures</td><td>How to express them</td><td>Interpretation</td><td>When to use</td></tr><tr><td>Accuracy</td><td>TP+TN TP+TN+FP+FN</td><td>The number of all correct predictionsIf the data is almost made by the algorithm over all typebalanced. of predictions made.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Recall (Sensitivity/ TP rate)</td><td>TPFN</td><td>The proportion of successful studentsTo concentrate on that classified correctly as &quot;successful&quot;，minimizing FN. for all successful students</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Precision</td><td>TPPFP</td><td>The proportion of successful studentsTo concentrate on that classified correctly as &quot;successful&quot;，minimizing FP. for all students predicted by the algorithm as a &quot;successful&quot; student.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Specificity (TN rate)</td><td>TFP</td><td>the proportion of non-successful students that are incorrectly considered as successful students, for all non-successful students.</td><td>To identify negative results.</td></tr><tr><td>F-Measure</td><td>2xPrecisionxRecall Precision+Recall</td><td>How precise your classifier is,as well as how robust it is</td><td>To find a balance between recall and precision.</td></tr><tr><td>ROC curve</td><td>Plotted at TP rate vs. FP rate where the TP rate is on the Yaxis and</td><td>The area under the curve (AUC): ·If near to the 1,means the model has high class separation capacity. the FP rate is on the X axis. ·If near to the O,means the model has no class separation capacity.</td><td>Used as a summary of the model&#x27;s skil.</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nA variety of factors have been investigated in the literature related to its impact on predicting students ‘academic success which was measured as academic achievement, as our investigation showed that prior-academic achievement, student demographics, elearning activity, psychological attributes, are the most common factors reported. In terms of prediction techniques, many algorithms have been applied to predict student success under the classification technique.\n\nMoreover, a six stages framework is proposed, and each stage is presented in detail. While technical background is kept to a minimum, as this not the scope of this study, all possible design and implementation decisions are covered, along with best practices compiled from the relevant literature.\n\nIt is an important implication of this review that educators and non-proficient users are encouraged to applied EDM techniques for undergraduate students from any discipline (e.g. social sciences). While reported findings are based on the literature (e.g. potential definition of academic success, features to measure it, important factors), any available additional data can easily be included in the analysis, including faculty data (e.g. competence, criteria of recruitment, academic qualifications) may be to discover new determinants.",
