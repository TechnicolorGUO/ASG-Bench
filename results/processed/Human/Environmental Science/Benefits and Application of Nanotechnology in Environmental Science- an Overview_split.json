Nanotechnology has been developed by a convergence of various sciences, providing the way to work at the atomic level and to create new structures. Nanotechnology includes the production of nanosized materials and devices and controlling them in order to use their unique characteristics. By using this definition, it is found that nanotechnology has numerous applications in various areas of life sciences, engineering, and medicine [1-3]. One of the areas where nanotechnology can be used is the environment (Fig. 1). The best strategies for the health of environment like human health involves three forms of prevention, care, and treatment [4, 5] so that before a big risk we should take care of the environment carefully and take deliberate measures to deal with it. Nanosensors will allow us to detect and to follow the effects of human activities on the environment accurately and quickly. Finally, when a risk occurred more than its usual level, nanotechnology solutions can be used to reduce environmental damage.\n\nNanotechnology helps us in refining existing pollutions and proper use of our available resources [5, 6].\n\nApplying nanotechnology will increase the efficiency of clean energy production. For example, solar cells, wind, sea, and geothermal energy can produce much energy efficiently using nanomaterials, and fossil energy will be replaced by renewable energy. Nanotechnology has caused the material to be consumed in a way that it effectively reduces the entering of pollutants, resulting from human activities, to the environment. In the wake of changes in industries using nanotechnology, we can produce the materials that are digestible in the environment and can be converted into another commodity. A planned movement toward some industries will reduce environmental damage. This is possible by nanotechnology [6, 7].\n\nDue to changes in lifestyle and increasing use of technology, the current world industry is faced with various environmental problems. This study deals with a potential application of nanotechnology to solve major environmental problems such as municipal solid waste management, air pollution, water scarcity, and nanomaterials safety.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 1.

Cause of the increasing population, and changes in people's lifestyles, the production of these materials is one of the environmental threats at the current time. Various types of dangerous organic and inorganic pollutants are entered into the water, soil, and air by industrial and urban waste. It is impossible to remove these pollutants simply by existing technologies. Therefore, employing modern technologies such as nanotechnology could have an important role in solving this problem. Some of the nanomaterials used widely in waste management include nanofilters, nanosensors, nanophotocatalysts, and nanoparticles [8, 9].",

Therefore, the use of pretreatment, posttreatment, and modern technologies is considered in removing contaminants from the environment. Nanofiltration has been considered in waste treatment without any need for chemicals that produced waste is concentrated and intensive, reducing its transportation and disposal cost. Applying nanofilters can remove 60 to $7 0 \\%$ of COD and $5 0 \\%$ of ammonium in the leachate. Nanofilters can be used to remove a wide range of pollutants such as anions and cations, arsenic, uranium, chromium, and pathogens from the wastewater [10-12]. Using nanofiltration technology requires controlling the amount of deposits on the membrane of filtration. One simple solution to solve the problem of befouling is cleaning or replacement of membrane that is expensive and costly. The convenient method is to use some compounds such as fullerenes that can prevent biological fouling. Bacteria and other microorganisms can also attach to each other and accumulate on the filtering membrane and inside the pipes. Gradually, bacteria and other microorganisms absorb other organic materials and create an organic film that can block the membranes. Fullerenes can also be useful by preventing the breathing of bacteria as membrane antifouling agents. Fullerenes, as clot-busting drugs, can prevent clogging of pipes and filtrating membrane. Coating pipes and membranes with these nanoparticles can be used as a suitable strategy to prevent biological fouling of them [13-15].",

These materials are not involved directly in oxidation and reduction reactions and merely provides the conditions required for the reaction. Titanium dioxide has almost all the characteristics of an ideal photocatalyst. Titanium dioxide produces free radicals in the presence of the three elements of water, oxygen, UV radiation that these radicals can breakdown various harmful compounds into lower toxic carbon compounds [16, 17]. Having higher surface to volume ratio, titanium dioxide nanoparticles show more desirable photocatalytic properties compared to larger particles. This material is used as a cover for fixed membranes, nanocrystalline microspheres, and membranes combined with silica to treat leachate resulting from waste material landfills. Titanium dioxide is very hydrophilic and can decompose most of the organic contaminants. Therefore, it is able to absorb heavy metals from wastewater [17, 18].\n\nPorous nanocatalysts can be used to convert the wastes into ethanol. For this purpose, the gasification process is used, in which carbon compounds are converted into syngas under high pressure and temperature in a controlled environment. Syngas is converted to ethanol at the presence of porous nanocatalysts. Syngas is mainly composed of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, lower amounts of carbon dioxide, and methane. Carbon monoxide molecules of syngas are producers of ethanol. Improving the absorption of these molecules by nanocatalysts, suitable conditions are provided to ethanol formation [19, 20].",

The membrane removes particles through three mechanisms, including direct contact of a particle with filter structure, applying the inertia force when changing the direction of gas, and electric charge effect of particle and structure of the filter. The main shortcoming of filters is the creation of a pressure drop that requires much energy to overcome this problem. Nanofilters have higher efficiency than conventional filters; with pores between 1 and $1 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ , they can remove different kinds of bacteria, viruses, and organic contaminants effectively [25, 26].\n\nMembranes based on carbon nanotubes have a higher capacity to separate carbon dioxide from the other gases. Carbon nanotubes can trap gases with a rate of more than 100 times than other gas separation technologies. Therefore, they are suitable for large scale separation. In the case of conventional membranes, there is an inverse relationship between the quality of gas separation and the amount of gas passing, while membranes based on carbon nanotubes have no these shortcomings. Nanomembrane technology can be widely used in the separation and purification of gases and pollutant vapors in various industries and preventing their release in the environment [27, 28].",

Conventional catalysts that are ceramic or metalbased catalysts have good efficiency, but they are very expensive. Therefore, nanostructured catalysts have been considered as a cheaper alternative for available catalysts [29, 30]. According to conducted research, carbon nanotubes are the most appropriate device to adsorb toxic pollutants such as dioxin and other pollutants releasing from chimneys of incinerator furnaces. Dioxin is a toxic byproduct of many industrial processes leading to long term contamination of air, soil, water, and living organisms, in addition to higher stability. Some dioxins are carcinogenic, and most of them cause disorder in the human immune system. Although many countries have controlled the production of this material in recent years, its environmental dangers are considered as threatening still. While carbon nanotubes are the most appropriate way to adsorb toxic pollutants such as dioxins, the cost high. Various studies are being done on the production of cheap carbon nanotubes. In addition, the use of carbon nanotubes in computer displays reduces the consumption of heavy metals in them, leading to reduced damage to the environment [31-33].",

Nanosensors are one of the new technologies in this area that are able to identify and respond to physical stimuli at a nanometre scale. Nanosensors can be classified into two categories of nanoparticles and nanostructured materials. Nanoparticles such as nanoscale spherical materials are used as receptors and as visual-spatial sensors. Nanosensors have been constructed from nanomaterials such as porous silicon, which are used to detect chemical and biological reactions [34, 35].\n\nLeakage of noxious and toxic gas is one of the risks of the industrial sector. Sensors used mainly in the industry often detect low concentrations of these gases lately. This makes it necessary to use new technologies in the production of faster and more accurate sensors. This type of sensor is made of a single layer or multilayer nanotubes, and they can adsorb molecules of toxic gases [34, 36]. They are also able to detect very little amounts of molecules of fatal gases. So far, nanosensors have been designed to identify different types of gaseous compounds, including dioxin, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and so on, having higher accuracy and speed than conventional sensors [37]. A new method of using nanosensors is applying them in the form of smart dust. By producing the first samples of smart dust, the use of such sensors closed to the scientific and applied stage. The main purpose of producing smart dust in the production of a series of advanced sensors in the form of very light nanocomputers. These ultrafine particles are made of silicon and can send the collected data to a central database via wireless in its structure. The data transfer rate is about one Kbps and more in this kind of sensor. These nanosensors remain suspended in the air easily for hours, and they can provide their energy from the sun. Smart dust can transmit data such as temperature, pressure, humidity, the amount of chemicals in the air up to $2 0 \\mathrm { k m }$ , and provide conditions to control air pollution continuously in a particular area [38, 39].",

Nanofilters are between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis methods in terms of diameter. Ultrafiltration method due to the higher amount of contaminants than allowed level and reverse osmosis method due to the creation of the purity more than needed. Its high cost consequently has some shortcomings [45]. Filters used in the process of nanofiltration compared with the other methods can treat contaminated water at an appropriate volume and desired quality by spending less energy and higher water penetration. Nanofilters are able to separate a variety of bacteria, viruses, pesticides, organic pollutants, and heavy metals from the water. In the nanofiltration process, no chemical is used for water softening, so its adverse environmental effects are less than conventional chemical methods. Nanofilters used for water treatment, in addition to the separation of bacterial and viral materials, can completely destroy them behind the filter wall. Such capacity is also used in air nanofilters doing exactly the same task [44, 46]. These filters use high surface energy of nanoparticles such as zinc and silver coated on a filter and in contact with any living structure destroy it. In nanofiltration, separation is done based on the size, and filters that have pores at nano sizes do not pass the smallest viruses. The use of active materials such as silver nanoparticles or titanium dioxide and ultraviolet light sources can increase this effect by destroying viruses, bacteria, and fungi trapped. As the size of the filter pores is smaller, the filter will have a higher capacity for separation. The important point on nanofilters compared to other filters is their selectivity power in removing the ions. By using nanofilters, the minerals necessary for human health remain in the water, and harmful substances are removed [47-49].",

Additionally, these particles are able to interact with various chemical groups leading to an increase in their affinity with the desired compounds [50, 51]. Given these characteristics, nanoparticles can be used as an appropriate tool to absorb pollutants and to treat contaminated water. One of the nanoparticles considered in the adsorption of pollutants is metal nanoparticles that are selected adsorbents with high capacity to adsorb a variety of metal ions and anions [52]. The most important metal nanoparticles used in water and wastewater treatment include silver, lanthanum, manganese oxide, zinc oxide, gold, and iron nanoparticles. Among metal nanoparticles, zero-valent iron (ZVI) nanoparticles are in priority in the treatment process due to abundance, cheapness, nontoxicity, and quick reaction with pollutants. Iron nanoparticles are considered as a new generation of biological monitoring technologies that can be considered a good solution for many environmental problems. These nanoparticles oxidize and decompose polluting compounds such as trichloroethylene, carbon tetrachloride, dioxins, and PCBs, and convert them into carbon compounds with lower toxicity [53, 54]. Neutral iron nanoparticles (nZVI) are used for non-situ and in-situ groundwater treatment. These nanoparticles can be injected directly for underground sources for in-situ treatment, or they can be used in filters for external applications. The advantage of these bimetallic particles related to their high activity, durability of decomposition, and reduced production of toxic materials. However, there are concerns about the toxicity of catalyst metals and the deactivation of the surface of the catalyst by formed a thick layer [55, 56]. Nanostructured bimetallic compounds such as iron-palladium, iron-silver, and zinc-palladium have large applications in the refining environmental pollutants [57].",

Titanium dioxide releases free radicals at the presence of water, oxygen, and UV radiation that can degrade contaminants into less toxic compounds. Nanophotocatalyst performance efficiency in water treatment depends on water pH, the oxygen content of water, intensity, and extent of contamination [58-60]. Nanophotocatalysts in the powder can be used in suspensions in the form of nanocrystalline microspheres, membranes mixed with silica, or other forms for water treatment. Separation of suspended nanopowders is difficult after treatment. Ultrafiltration or microfiltration is used to separate these particles. However, significant amounts of these particles are destroyed during this process. Applying photocatalysts in the form of nanocrystalline microspheres is more desired for water treatment since they are easily recyclable in this state.",

Most membranes are made of polymer materials, causing problems and cannot create an appropriate balance between the membrane input and its selectivity. Nanotube membranes provide appropriate selectivity at high inputs. These membranes can almost eliminate all types of water contaminations. Nanometric porosity of nanotubes has made these filters to have higher selectivity than other water treatment technologies [67]. Nanosieves are composed of coupled carbon nanotubes located on a porous and flexible substrate. To form paper-like filters, nanotubes can be placed under a flat or tubular substrate. Different portable filters based on this technology are constructed for water treatment. Some of these filters are at the size of a pencil known as a water stick, having the treatment capacity of one liter of water in 90 seconds. During their useful lifetime, these filters can treat about 300 liters of water that this amount could be increased with change before filtration [68, 69].",
