# A Systematic Review of the Hydrological, Environmental and Durability Performance of Permeable Pavement Systems

# Abstract:
 Due to urbanization, large portions of vegetated territory have been replaced by waterproof surfaces. The consequences are greater outflows, lower infiltration, and lower evapotranspiration. Pavement systems made with permeable surfaces allow the infiltration of water, ensuring reduction of runoff volume. In this paper, the methods of analysis of the hydrological and environmental performance of the pavement systems are reviewed in the context of urban drainage and regarding their durability. The purpose is to present an overview of the studies published during the last decade in the field. The Pubmed and Web Science Core Collection electronic databases were used to conduct the scientific literature survey. This generated 1238 papers, of which only 17 met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review. The evidence drawn from the knowledge on which the document is based provides useful critical interpretations of existing studies to progress the current understanding on hydrological performance and environment impacts in terms of conventional pollutant removal efficiency and the current permeable pavement systems.

# 1. Introduction

A critical design objective for urban rainwater management is the protection of flow paths and natural water balances. Achieving this goal is aimed at preventing and mitigating disruptions in natural processes, which in turn contributes to making flow systems unhealthy. New planning techniques and engineering systems can help in the economic, environmental, cultural, and social impacts associated with urban stormwater. An increasingly accepted approach to address the challenges of stormwater design and management is the implementation of so-called LID (low impact development). This represents a design philosophy that encompasses planning methods and rainwater-management technologies in order to reduce as much as possible the negative impacts deriving from urban rainwater, such as the degradation of the quality of underground and surface water, the loss of recharge and aquatic biodiversity, floods, and erosion [1,2]. Rainwater management is also important regarding the pollutants it carries deriving from anthropogenic activities and environmental processes. For example, the suspended materials from vehicular traffic, tire wear, and oil and gas leaks from vehicles are deposited on pavements, and all of this material is carried by rainwater and infiltrates between the surface of permeable pavement and the other base layers, accumulating over time. The pollutants most detected are total suspended solids (TSS), metals, hydrocarbons, chlorides, bacteria, and nutrients. Furthermore, particular attention must be paid to the discharge of excess nutrients into water bodies as they cause the seasonal eutrophication and algal proliferation phenomena. In fact, high levels of nu-loads carried by rainwater.

# 3.1. Hydrological Performance of PPS

In order to fully define the hydrological characteristics of a PPS, it should be monitored in a series of specific conditions such as in storm events of varying intensity and duration and in different antecedent and seasonally variable conditions. The geological and climatic conditions and the age conditions of a pavement, as well as differences in the design of PPS (such as boundary conditions and insufficient drainage) influence the hydrological results and are therefore fundamental to the comparison of performance.

A valid tool is provided by the statistical analyses that report the findings in terms of statistically significant differences compared to the “control graphs” [6,7].

Through the monitoring, it was possible to expand the number of monitorable hydraulic parameters and conduct an analysis of the timing and duration of the flow, registering a reduction in volume and peak flow [8]. The same result is recorded in simulations.

Several studies, analyzing different aspects, demonstrate the variability of volumes and peak flow [1]. Other studies have found that PP systems do not generate outflow for minor events preceded by dry antecedent conditions [9,10].

Although surface runoff volumes are usually lower in permeable pavements rather than asphalt ones, sometimes increases in runoff are possible (i.e., negative volume reductions), as it may happen that rainwater previously stored in a PP system is released during an event [11].

A study of interlocking permeable concrete pavement (PICP) on low-permeability soils in New Zealand [7] found greater than expected reductions in runoff volume; the authors suggested that the most probable explanation could be given by hydrological losses, such as the phenomenon of evaporation, and/or by the possible presence of fractures within the underlying soils. Some studies [12–14] have found that the increase in evaporation rates in PP is a function of basic materials, as well as the vegetation and the color of the stone.

Both laboratory and field tests are important for hydraulic performance. Sometimes, laboratory-scale studies can complement those carried out in the field to evaluate the hydraulic properties of PP, but it is important to use well-defined and controlled conditions.

Furthermore, studies can also be conducted outdoors to investigate evapotranspiration processes that require exposure to natural conditions, but measuring instruments, such as lysimeters, are not easily installed on a large scale [12]. The study conducted by Hou et al. [13] included a low-conductivity soil layer as a boundary condition for the PP samples. On the contrary, the drainage of pavement samples in outdoor collection systems does not exactly replicate the performance of PP and is therefore not realistic. Others simulated a rain event and saw that exfiltration water continued to flow out of the soil layer for up to 10 days after the event.

These differences in observations between studies highlight the problem of the absence of a standard method; furthermore, the estimation of soil properties based on small soil samples can drastically undervalue mass hydraulic conductivity.

In order to provide a clear and concise framework on the current state of the art on hydrological performance of pavement systems, a systematic description of the main results obtained from the studies of the papers selected for this review has been reported in Table 2.

# 3.2. Environmental Performances

Permeable pavement systems, unlike conventional pavement, can reduce the amount of pollutants transported by rainwater and therefore decrease the total quantity of pollutants delivered to the receiving water bodies (Figure 3). This is an important aspect, and many researchers have focused on the quality of surface water in receiving water bodies, but the problem of contamination also affects groundwater. In fact, many permeable pavement systems allow the partial or total exfiltration of contaminants to the deeper layers of the pavement, where there may be the presence of underground aquifers [17]. Another very common aspect is the use of the mean concentration of events (EMC) as a means of estimating the impact on water quality of common contamination index parameters (e.g., TSS, TN, TP, etc.) or, alternatively, the percentage reduction of the total concentration of contamination [18,19]. However, although they can be useful tools for a rapid analysis of the performance of the PP, they are not suitable for giving detailed information on the real action carried out by the pavement. Each type of PP related to each specific contaminant analyzed has a different removal mechanism, therefore evaluating, in a single analysis, different types of contaminants all together does not give clear answers on the pavement’s removal efficiency and also makes this efficiency susceptible to large variations in function in the contaminated water sample tested. For example, samples of water with high percentages of chloride will give rise to very low PP efficiencies, as this is generally not retained; the same PP exposed to a different water sample (with a lower concentration of non retained contaminants) will give rise to higher efficiencies. Furthermore, if what is tested upstream is unknown, it is not possible to ascertain its removal downstream. Therefore, although some studies have done so [15], much of the published research doesEVIEW 7 of 12 not provide a characterization of the contamination matrix.

Removal efficiency of permeable pavement systems.Other studies instead [16,20] record important reductions (even over $5 0 \%$ ) of conservative contaminants such as heavy metals, but in many cases, rainwater was tested for an insufficient number of events and as independent studies, meaning that these experiments results provide only limited reliability.

Beyond 10 m, only a further strating that they could have a positive effect on the removal of some nutrients [21]. It is also important to investigate the source of the contamination, as it gives answers if, for otal phosphorus load was reduced by nearly 20 percent for PICP and PA, example, the inefficiency of a pavement is due to the pavement itself or to an exceptional cause. In fact, in one study it was observed that the sand detected in the samples taken downstream of the pavement were not due to its inefficiency but to a continuous spill of litter sand directly into the drainage pipes [20].

Overall, therefore, in order to define the real efficiencies in removing contaminants from permeable pavements and their environmental impact on water quality, further efforts must be made on the characterization and source of the contamination.

# 3.3. Durability of Hydrological and Environmental Performance of PPS

There are several reasons why a PPS may not meet its functional goals during its useful life. One of the most critical conditions is the loss of its permeability; if the pavement loses its permeability, it will not be able to pursue the main hydrology and water quality objectives.

Age also affects the dynamic mechanisms of pollutant removal, such as absorption [24,25]. This paragraph presents a brief description of the main factors that reduce the durability of hydrological performance and water quality.

Regarding permeability, PP works like a filter and, as such, particle filtration decreases the pavement’s ability to infiltrate water over time. This process has been documented by numerous authors, and all of them stress that the effects of the clogging of permeability should be reversible by applying regular maintenance [26,27].

The reduction of the surface permeability of a PPS has a double effect. In the first place, if rainwater does not infiltrate at the same speed as precipitation, the formation of surface runoff and stagnation will be inevitable. Secondly, if the PPS behaves like an impermeable surface, all environmental benefits, including the reduction of pollutant loads, volumes, and flow peaks, are lost. To prevent and mitigate this result, maintenance is the most important strategy; removal of the clogging material before the hydrological and water quality functions of the system are significantly inhibited is essential.

The factors that contribute to the clogging of permeable pavements are many. Traffic is one of them; higher traffic rates lead to higher levels of permeability loss [28]. In other cases, it has been observed that the insertion of geotextiles can prevent infiltration and therefore reduce the permeability requirement of the pavement [29]. In cold climates, following winter maintenance (even a single winter is enough), the floors are smooth, and this leads to a drastic loss of permeability. This shows that the performance of permeable pavements should also be correlated to the climatic conditions of the areas in which they are installed [30]. However, it was found that, in the winter seasons when the temperature drops below zero, the PPS were able to promptly drain the water and therefore it was not present within the storage volume.

Conversely, rainwater exfiltration often causes higher humidity levels in the underlying soils, which increases the latent heat of the soil and postpones freezing within the pavement. Furthermore, the thawing processes are accelerated by the infiltration of meltwater from the surface [31].

Finally, the probability of remobilization has important repercussions for the likely contamination of groundwater systems. Many studies have observed that most pollutants are captured close to the pavement surface and in the first few centimeters of the porous medium [32]. Therefore, in terms of water quality goals, PPs are much more likely to fail due to surface obstruction than due to storage depletion.

Table 4 contains a brief description of the main results obtained by the selected papers in relation to long-term performance.

# 4. Discussion

Through the research carried out for this study, it was possible to observe that, in many cases, the results of the studies conducted are discordant with those expected and the authors often found themselves formulating hypotheses to provide an explanation without any proof. In other cases, however, studies conducted on the same aspect and on the same type of PP provide completely different results. This latest evidence emphasizes a very important aspect, namely, the absence of a standard or well-defined method for the evaluation of permeable pavement systems. There is no standard that excludes as many unrealistic boundary conditions as possible or that underestimates some aspects, and this leads to very conflicting results.

To give some examples, it is clear that the absence of an exact indication of the reproduction of precipitation events for the evaluation of the disposal capacity of the PP runoff volumes or, more generally, of their hydrological performance, has led many authors to conduct studies to underestimate conditions (number of reproduced events fewer than 5) or unrealistic (the events in the same sample have no correlation with each other and are independent), making their results automatically unreliable. Others reveal the absence of a consistent percentage of volumes of water disposed of by evapotranspiration or other hydrological phenomena without providing any certainty since their studies are conducted in the laboratory, and the climatic conditions cannot be faithfully reproduced in reality. Some overcome this obstacle by moving outdoors; however, even in that case some criticalities were found. In those cases, in fact, often the study was focused on a too-small portion of land; at other times it neglected the boundary conditions of the sample analyzed, or they were not accurate, and at other times, difficulties were encountered, as some instruments cannot be easily brought into the field.

In 2013, Drake et al. [33] provided an important review on the issue, advising to change the direction the research was aiming for because it would not lead to the achievement of reliable results. At present, the situation has not changed; many studies still aim to contribute by proposing further new methods or by reproducing studies to scale with the same simplifying hypotheses that distort the reliability of the results, and little or no effort is concentrated on a study with, for example, a longer analysis time than on average done so far, conducted outdoors, and exposed to real climatic and anthropic conditions, a study that certainly may have its criticalities but which at least exceeds those already discussed and consolidated in the past.

In general, laboratory studies, whether they are to evaluate the hydrological or environmental performance, neglect many aspects including the climatic conditions that we have already mentioned, the dry-wet conditions cycles to which they are naturally subjected, vehicle traffic loads, chemical inputs, and even the growth of biofilms or surface crusts that reduce their permeability. Another important aspect is the reproduction of reliable precipitation events. To this end, precipitation events must be as variable as occurs in nature, and it is necessary to reproduce a sufficient number of real and consecutive rain events in order to be correlated with each other.

Furthermore, a characterization of the polluting loads, upstream and downstream of the system, is necessary; in fact, it has been seen that the removal mechanisms are not the same for everyone. Finally, it is required that greater attention is paid to the impact of the quality of underground waters, as well as those on the surface. Another very critical aspect is the durability of the functional objectives of the permeable pavement. While on the one hand, it is not disputed that they are designed with good permeability and that this is unquestionably a property that brings countless advantages, on the other hand, it is also true that this property is reduced or lost in the short- and medium-term, in some cases, due to the progressive clogging of the PPS layers without the possibility of reversibility (medium term), and in some cases, due to very harsh winter weather conditions that make the pavement a waterproof slab (short term). The question that derives is: what is the use of investing in a permeable pavement if, after a short time, it will behave exactly like a waterproof pavement?

In our opinion, this represents great criticality, as it creates enormous difficulty in proposing permeable pavement as a reliable system to which everyone should strive to use. These systems have great potential and converge on the common goal of a sustainable urban system, but as long as the advantages and disadvantages of such techniques are not shared in literature, such systems will never find much space in practical applications.

# 5. Conclusions

The aim of this work was to provide a critical review of the studies conducted on permeable pavement systems highlighting a critical point: scale reproducibility. In fact, in many cases, the results of the studies conducted are discordant with those expected and with studies conducted on the same aspect and on the same type of PP, which often provide completely different results. The following is a summary of the main missing studies that could be useful to researchers to bridge the shortcomings of the existing studies:

• studies with a longer analysis time and that are conducted outdoors, exposed to real climatic and anthropic conditions;   
• studies with a more reliable and variable reproduction of precipitation events;   
• studies with characterization of the polluting loads analyzed;   
• studies with greater attention paid to the impact on the quality of underground waters, as well as on surface waters;   
• studies with more insights on the possibility of making PP reversible.

Permeable pavement systems certainly have numerous advantages, however, if these are not accompanied by the suitable durability of the functional objectives, the problem will not be solved. For this reason, it is therefore important to reflect on the path to follow in order to progress in research on permeable pavement systems; this critical review is intended as an encouragement to go in the correct direction and not to continue to concentrate one’s efforts on themes already extensively investigated and discussed. If we all agree that PPS are a valid system, then the time has come to overcome the obstacles encountered and not to continue to retrace them by persevering in the mistakes of the past, albeit each time in a different way.

Summaries, such as this review, want to be a useful tool, both for researchers and designers, industries, and government agencies, to further promote the understanding and acceptance of PPs in addition to providing an extensive list of issues and problems on which to focus in the future.
