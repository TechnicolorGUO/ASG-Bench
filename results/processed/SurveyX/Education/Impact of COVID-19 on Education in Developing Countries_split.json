      "content": "Educational inequality in developing countries is rooted in enduring structural disadvantages, such as poverty, geographic isolation, and institutionalized discrimination, which have historically restricted access to quality education for marginalized groups [1]. Pre-pandemic data indicate significant enrollment disparities, with children from the poorest quintiles being 3–4 times more likely to be out of school compared to their wealthier peers. These disparities are not anomalies but reflect chronic access issues exacerbated by rural-urban divides, where rural schools often lack essential infrastructure and qualified teachers, resulting in a persistent achievement gap.\n\nColonial legacies have further entrenched these inequalities through centralized resource allocation favoring urban elites, often neglecting rural and marginalized communities. Ethnic and linguistic minorities face additional challenges due to language policies that marginalize non-dominant groups, limiting educational participation. Gender disparities are particularly pronounced, with cultural norms and early marriage practices disproportionately affecting girls’ education in certain regions. These factors create a multidimensional inequality matrix where socioeconomic status, geography, and identity collectively determine educational access and outcomes.\n\nUnderinvestment in public education systems, with many countries spending less than $3 \\%$ of GDP on educationbelow the recommended $6 \\%$ perpetuates these patterns. This underfunding results in overcrowded classrooms, outdated curricula, and inadequate teacher training, mirroring broader societal inequalities and limiting social mobility through education. Addressing these historical injustices requires understanding the structural barriers shaping educational landscapes and committing to reforms prioritizing equity and inclusion.",

      "content": "Before the COVID-19 pandemic, developing countries exhibited profound disparities in access to ICT, significantly impacting educational equity. Urban-rural divides were stark, with rural communities facing systemic barriers to e-learning due to inadequate infrastructure and limited digital literacy [2]. Wealthier households had 4–5 times higher internet penetration rates compared to low-income families, as shown in cross-national datasets [3]. The pre-pandemic digital divide existed across three dimensions: infrastructure availability, technological proficiency, and institutional readiness.\n\nInfrastructural limitations were most severe in remote areas, where only $12 \\mathrm { - } 1 8 \\%$ of schools had reliable internet, compared to $6 5 \\mathrm { - } 7 2 \\%$ in urban centers, hindering technology-mediated learning [4]. Device ownership showed similar inequalities, with smartphone penetration below $30 \\%$ in rural households versus $78 \\%$ in urban areas. These discrepancies affected marginalized students’ access to digital resources. Teacher preparedness surveys revealed fewer than $40 \\%$ of educators in developing regions had basic ICT integration skills before 2020 [5], hindering effective technology use and perpetuating disadvantage.\n\nInstitutional capacity was also lacking, with many systems without coherent digital learning policies or platforms, leaving schools unprepared for remote instruction [6]. The absence of strategic frameworks resulted in fragmented digital learning approaches, leaving educators and students in disarray during critical times. The digital divide also had temporal and demographic dimensions, with minimal pre-2020 interest in online platforms among populations with limited internet access, as shown by longitudinal analyses [1]. Older students faced greater challenges adapting to digital tools, reflecting varying technological socialization levels across generations.\n\nThese conditions created a stratified technological landscape where location, income, and institutional support determined digital learning access, setting the stage for exacerbated inequalities during pandemic-induced school closures. Emerging approaches like gamified learning platforms remained largely inaccessible to disadvantaged populations due to these barriers [7]. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing interventions to bridge the digital divide and promote equitable educational access.",

      "content": "Socioeconomic factors have historically been formidable barriers to educational access in developing countries, creating persistent stratification in learning opportunities. Income disparities directly influence educational investments, with families in the lowest wealth quintiles allocating less than $5 \\%$ of expenditures to education compared to $1 5 \\mathrm { - } 2 0 \\%$ among higher-income groups [8]. This economic constraint affects school fees, uniforms, and materials, with many families relying on child labor, limiting school attendance and impacting future workforce participation.\n\nFamily background compounds these barriers, as intergenerational educational attainment strongly predicts children’s school participation. This pattern is pronounced in rural communities, where enrollment among first-generation learners is $40 \\%$ lower compared to families with educated parents [2]. This cycle of poverty and educational disadvantage traps children in limited opportunity cycles. Economic and social capital intersections create complex exclusion mechanisms perpetuating disparities.\n\nChildren from marginalized backgrounds often attend under-resourced public schools, while wealthier families choose private institutions, perpetuating achievement gaps measured at 1.5–2 standard deviations in test scores between socioeconomic groups [8]. Household responsibilities disproportionately affect girls, with caregiving duties and early marriage curtailing education. The digital dimension of these disparities became salient during school closures, as socioeconomic status determined access to devices, internet, and conducive home learning environments [9].\n\nStructural barriers extend beyond costs to opportunity costs and systemic biases. Public schools in low-income areas often lack qualified teachers, with student-teacher ratios exceeding 60:1, limiting individualized attention. Traditional exams disadvantage economically vulnerable students, as they fail to accommodate diverse learning backgroundsa challenge addressed through adaptive assessment tools, though inaccessible to underfunded schools [10].

The proposed network-based model for centralized Learning Management Systems remained largely unimplemented due to infrastructural and funding constraints [2]. Connectivity, device accessibility, and platform robustness were major barriers, with rural institutions particularly affected [1]. Technological limitations hindered classroom interaction replication, as evidenced by degraded engagement across key themes [9]. Innovative solutions like the Cloud Universal Access Framework for STEM assessments [14] faced network capacity challenges in developing contexts.\n\nTeacher preparedness was a critical issue, with digital literacy gaps limiting effective pedagogical adaptation. The Digital Twin Architecture [17] offered potential for virtual learning environments but required technical expertise beyond the reach of many educators. Professional development systems inadequately prepared teachers for technology integration and engagement maintenance, with attention retention identified as a major challenge [1]. Addressing these gaps through targeted training is essential for equipping educators to thrive in digital learning environments.\n\nAssessment integrity posed additional challenges, as traditional methods proved incompatible with remote contexts. The CUAF framework highlighted complexities in secure online assessments, particularly for STEM disciplines [14].

The Digital Twin Architecture proposed by [17] offers potential for democratizing content creation, yet socioeconomic barriers limit its implementation, affecting both educators and students. Device ownership, digital skill acquisition, and adaptive learning capabilities create intersecting disadvantages for marginalized students. Studies indicate that upper-income households are 4–5 times more likely to own dedicated learning devices compared to the poorest [12], exacerbating digital literacy gaps. Virtual learning environments remain inaccessible to those without basic computing devices, necessitating policy reevaluation to ensure equitable technological resource distribution.\n\nDigital skill acquisition varies significantly by socioeconomic status, with private school educators showing 2–3 times higher digital pedagogy proficiency than those in underfunded public schools [5]. This disparity creates a feedback loop where disadvantaged students encounter educators with limited capacity to teach digital competencies. Content creation tools could mitigate these gaps, but require infrastructure and training investments that are unevenly distributed. Targeted professional development for educators is essential to impart digital skills.\n\nAdaptive learning potential is similarly mediated by socioeconomic status, with students from higher-income households better navigating online learning modalities [2]. The customizable environments proposed in [17] benefit those with prior digital exposure, highlighting the need for inclusive digital literacy programs.

While it aims to produce high-quality, coherent, and comprehensive surveys with accurate citations, the final output is derived from the AI’s synthesis of pre-processed materials, which may contain limitations or inaccuracies. As such, the generated content should not be used for academic publication or formal submissions and must be independently reviewed and verified.
