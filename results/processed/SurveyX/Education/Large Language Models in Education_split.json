      "content": "AI tutors are advanced educational systems utilizing machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and adaptive algorithms to offer personalized learning experiences [6]. These systems surpass traditional educational technologies by dynamically adjusting content based on learner attributes such as cognitive states and proficiency levels. This adaptability is essential in meeting diverse educational needs effectively. A key feature of AI tutors is their ability to model personalized preferences from diverse user interactions, creating tailored learning paths that accommodate varying learning modalities [7]. Unlike traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS), AI tutors are characterized by (1) real-time adaptation to learners’ evolving knowledge states, (2) multi-task learning for cross-domain pattern recognition in resource-limited settings [8], and (3) neuroadaptive interfaces responsive to cognitive and affective feedback [9]. Studies like those on the Yixue adaptive learning platform show these systems’ superior performance in subjects like mathematics and English compared to conventional methods [10].\n\nLLMs, a subset of AI tutors, are defined by transformer-based architectures and generative capabilities. While traditional AI tutors use multimodal adaptive systems for comprehensive knowledge delivery, LLMs focus on language understanding and content generation through deep neural networks [11]. This focus on language processing supports innovative applications across learning contexts. AI tutors construct individualized learning trajectories through continuous knowledge modeling [12], whereas LLMs offer scalable solutions for interactive content generation and automated assessment, enhancing accessibility for diverse learners. This functional complementarity allows LLMs to democratize quality education access in underserved regions [2], while AI tutors provide detailed personalization through neuroadaptive interfaces and real-time analytics [9].\n\nThe technological architectures of these systems reveal distinct differences impacting educational effectiveness. AI tutors employ specialized mechanisms for measuring item similarity in personalized contexts [13], while LLMs use generative capacities to produce scalable, context-aware educational materials. This architectural divergence highlights each system’s strengths: AI tutors focus on personalized experiences, and LLMs enhance content accessibility and engagement. Both paradigms face challenges in maintaining pedagogical quality, particularly with learnersourcing practices [3], and require careful consideration of educator perceptions [5]. Privacy-preserving techniques, such as decentralized learning frameworks, are critical in deploying personalized AI tutors [14]. The convergence of these technologies signifies a transformative shift in education, combining adaptive tutoring precision with generative AI scalability, addressing persistent challenges in personalized instruction [15].",

      "content": "The evolution of AI in education spans three technological epochs: rule-based systems, statistical learning models, and modern generative architectures. Early computer-assisted instruction (CAI) systems, limited by computational constraints, relied on rigid scripts and Boolean logic [16]. These systems delivered content linearly, often failing to engage students effectively. The shift to probabilistic models in the 1990s introduced Bayesian knowledge tracing and item response theory, allowing nuanced proficiency assessments [17]. This shift addressed scalability limitations in manual adaptive systems and laid the foundation for modern learning analytics [18]. The transition from rigid rule-based systems to flexible statistical models marked a significant advancement in educational technology.\n\nVygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory has evolved through AI tutors from static content sequencing to dynamic neuroadaptive interfaces. ZPD’s application in AI underscores tailoring learning experiences to individual learners’ capabilities and growth areas. Contemporary implementations use real-time metrics and affective state detection to build personalized learning scaffolds [19], with advanced systems using time-series analysis to preempt learning discontinuities [20]. This dynamic approach creates a responsive educational environment adaptable to evolving learner needs. The constructivist paradigm has also transformed via multimodal knowledge discovery, where AI analyzes educational artifacts like lecture recordings to build cognitive profiles [21].\n\nThe generative AI revolution has introduced tensions between pedagogical fidelity and technological capability.

These advancements coincide with challenges in teacher adaptation, as educators navigate changing classroom dynamics and redefine roles in AI-augmented environments [22]. Advanced robotics education exemplifies these tensions, where institutional constraints and instructor shortages persist despite technological availability [23]. This evolution reflects complexities in implementing AI in education, balancing innovation with practical considerations.\n\nCurrent theoretical syntheses emphasize hybrid models that maintain interpretability while leveraging neural adaptability. The convergence of knowledge-based systems with generative architectures represents ongoing negotiations between established learning theories and computational innovation [24]. This evolution highlights the need for alignment between AI capabilities and curricular requirements, addressing institutional resistance to pedagogical transformation [25]. Future developments will likely focus on (1) enhanced teacher-AI collaboration frameworks maintaining human oversight, (2) robust validation mechanisms for generative content accuracy, and (3) scalable solutions for equitable access to advanced educational technologies [23]. These focus areas will be crucial in shaping AI’s future in education, ensuring technological advancements enhance educational outcomes.\n\nIn recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in educational contexts has garnered significant attention, particularly through the development of AI Tutors and Large Language Models (LLMs). This evolution is not merely a technological advancement; it represents a paradigm shift in how educational content is delivered and personalized. To elucidate this hierarchical structure, Figure 2 illustrates the various applications of AI Tutors and LLMs within education. The figure highlights key areas such as personalized learning, content generation, interactive experiences, assessment automation, and empirical case studies. Each of these categories is further subdivided into specific innovations and methodologies, thereby emphasizing the transformative potential and challenges associated with the integration of AI in educational settings.
