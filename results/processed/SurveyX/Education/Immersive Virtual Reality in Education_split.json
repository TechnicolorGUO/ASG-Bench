Immersive technologies bridge this gap by facilitating virtual laboratories, remote telescopes, and interactive tutorials that connect theoretical knowledge with practical application. For instance, AR/VR tools mitigate distance learning challenges by providing visually rich, hands-on experiences that significantly enhance comprehension and retention [5]. The World Wide Student Laboratory (WWSL) Project exemplifies this potential, offering wider access to resources and enabling realtime collaboration across global educational contexts [6].\n\n[Image]\nFigure 1: chapter structure\n\nMoreover, immersive technologies enable personalized and adaptive learning, tailoring educational experiences to individual student needs and behaviors [7]. This capability is critical in addressing suboptimal learning behaviors in exploratory environments like MOOCs, where generic support systems often fail to counteract detrimental habits [7]. The CK-cent model further emphasizes ´ the importance of understanding learners’ conceptions for designing effective teaching situations, highlighting the role of immersive technologies in transforming learning environments [8]. Interdisciplinary applicationssuch as combining neuroscience, robotics, and computer sciencedemonstrate how these technologies can revitalize curricula and deepen engagement [9]. For example, IoT technologies in higher education enhance student engagement and learning outcomes, showcasing the broader impact of smart education tools [10].\n\nIn specialized fields like medical education, immersive technologies provide realistic training scenarios, such as virtual clinical examinations and simulated patient interactions, which are critical for skill development. Similarly, in physics and computer science education, VR environments and robotic integrations enhance understanding of complex concepts, offering students hands-on experiences that are otherwise inaccessible. The role of immersive technologies in addressing educational disparities is also notable, as AR tools have been shown to improve language proficiency in underserved regions by overcoming outdated teaching methods and resource limitations [11].\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain, including equitable access, scalability, and the underutilization of advanced features in virtual classrooms [12].

While it aims to produce high-quality, coherent, and comprehensive surveys with accurate citations, the final output is derived from the AI’s synthesis of pre-processed materials, which may contain limitations or inaccuracies. As such, the generated content should not be used for academic publication or formal submissions and must be independently reviewed and verified. The developers of SurveyX do not assume responsibility for any errors or consequences arising from the use of the generated surveys.",
