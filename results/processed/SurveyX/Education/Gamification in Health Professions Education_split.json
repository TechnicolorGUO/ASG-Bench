Immersive technologies, such as Virtual Reality (VR) and haptic feedback systems, are redefining surgical education by offering realistic, interactive practice environments, thereby improving learner engagement and knowledge retention and ultimately aiming to elevate patient care standards. A substantial body of literature underscores the efficacy of these innovations in enhancing educational outcomes [1, 2, 3]. Historically reliant on didactic lectures and apprenticeship models, medical training now benefits from interactive, immersive, and scalable alternatives catering to diverse learning styles.\n\nCurrent digital game methodologies in health education include game-based learning, gamification, serious games, medical simulations, and virtual patient training systems. Game-based learning utilizes the motivational aspects of games to bolster engagement and retention, rooted in constructivist theories that advocate for active and experiential learning. Recent AI advancements in creating tailored simulation scenarios further exemplify this trend by integrating semi-structured data with large language models to foster engagement and enhance knowledge acquisition, allowing learners to interact with realistic, clinically relevant situations [1, 3].\n\nGamification applies game design elements, such as points and leaderboards, to non-game contexts to motivate learners and reinforce desired behaviors, increasing engagement and participation. Serious games, designed explicitly for educational purposes, simulate real-world clinical scenarios, allowing learners to practice decision-making and procedural skills in a risk-free environment. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, significantly contributing to skill acquisition and confidence-building in healthcare professionals.\n\nMedical simulations, particularly those with haptic feedback, provide essential tactile cues that enhance training realism and effectiveness, especially in surgical education. Advanced haptic-based technologies, such as cost-effective visuo-haptic simulators, enable trainees to practice surgical skills safely, reducing risks associated with real-life procedures. AI-driven simulation scenarios streamline the educational process, offering diverse, clinically relevant training opportunities that enhance engagement and retention. Virtual patient training systems extend these capabilities by providing dynamic, interactive cases that adapt to learner inputs, fostering critical thinking and diagnostic skills.\n\nTheoretical foundations include cognitive load theory, emphasizing information processing management; situated learning, highlighting context in knowledge acquisition; and deliberate practice principles, focusing on structured skill refinement. These frameworks inform the development of innovative educational methods, such as AI-generated scenarios and VR training, enhancing learning efficiency and effectiveness. Cognitive load theory optimizes information presentation, situated learning values context-rich environments, and deliberate practice is facilitated by digital games’ repetitive, feedback-driven nature [4, 1, 3, 2].\n\nDespite their potential, digital game adoption in health professions faces challenges, including validation needs, high development costs, and technological variability. Collaboration among educators, developers, and researchers is crucial to creating digital games that adhere to educational standards. Recent advancements, such as using Large Language Models for automating simulation scenario development and VR technologies like Surgical Digital Twins, offer immersive experiences that replicate real environments. Haptic feedback systems enhance tactile perception in minimally invasive surgery training. Future advancements in AI-driven simulations and VR/AR technologies promise to further enhance realism and accessibility, paving the way for broader implementation across health professions. Continued research and collaboration are essential to optimize these technologies’ effectiveness and integration into medical curricula [1, 2, 3].",
