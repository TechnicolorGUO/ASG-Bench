A primary concern is pollution, as stormwater transports contaminants such as heavy metals, hydrocarbons, and nutrients from impervious surfaces into water bodies, degrading aquatic ecosystems [1]. The complex turbulent flow dynamics in traditional drainage systems further complicate pollutant removal, limiting the efficacy of conventional hydrodynamic separators. Flooding risks are amplified by reduced infiltration capacity in urban areas, where impervious surfaces dominate, leading to heightened peak discharges and overwhelmed drainage infrastructure [2]. The strain on traditional systems is compounded by their static design, which often fails to accommodate the nonlinear hydrological responses induced by urban expansion.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 1: chapter structure\n\nSimulation models, while valuable for planning, frequently lack the realism required to accurately predict these dynamics, particularly when aligned with practical learning goals for urban water management [2]. Emerging research underscores the need for adaptive solutions that integrate real-time monitoring and advanced fluid mechanics to address these challenges, as demonstrated by timeresolving particle image velocimetry studies of stormwater treatment systems [1]. The limitations of existing models highlight the necessity for innovative approaches that can accommodate the complexities of urban hydrology. Future directions must prioritize interdisciplinary approaches to mitigate the cascading impacts of urban runoff on water quality, infrastructure resilience, and ecosystem health.\n\nAddressing urban runoff challenges is essential not only for maintaining water quality but also for ensuring the sustainability of urban environments. As cities continue to grow, the need for effective stormwater management strategies becomes increasingly critical. The integration of advanced modeling techniques and real-time data analysis can significantly enhance our understanding of urban runoff dynamics. By fostering collaboration among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, the development of comprehensive strategies can lead to more resilient urban water management systems.",

Unlike conventional drainage systems, green infrastructure leverages decentralized techniques such as permeable pavements, bioswales, and rain gardens to restore natural infiltration processes and mitigate pollutant loads [2]. These systems reduce peak discharges by attenuating flow velocities and increasing storage capacity, thereby alleviating pressure on overloaded infrastructure. The integration of real-time monitoring and adaptive design principles further optimizes performance, as evidenced by advancements in fluid dynamics modeling and particle image velocimetry studies [1].\n\nA critical advantage of green infrastructure lies in its multifunctionality, which extends beyond stormwater management to include urban heat island mitigation, biodiversity enhancement, and aesthetic improvements. Simulation models, while traditionally limited in realism for educational applications, now incorporate dynamic hydrological processes to better represent the interactions between green infrastructure components and urban watersheds [2]. This evolution in modeling reflects a growing recognition of the complexity of urban ecosystems and the need for solutions that can adapt to varying environmental conditions. However, challenges persist in scaling these solutions across diverse urban landscapes, necessitating interdisciplinary collaboration to address site-specific constraints such as soil permeability and land-use conflicts.\n\nFuture advancements should focus on hybrid systems that combine green infrastructure with smart technologies, leveraging machine learning for predictive maintenance and performance optimization. By integrating cutting-edge technologies with established green infrastructure practices, cities can enhance their capacity to manage stormwater effectively while promoting ecological health. The potential for green infrastructure to serve as a multifunctional tool in urban planning underscores the importance of continued research and innovation in this field.
