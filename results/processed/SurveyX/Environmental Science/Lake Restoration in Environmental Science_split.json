Lakes act as natural filters, regulating nutrient cycles and mitigating the impacts of anthropogenic pollution; yet their degradation due to eutrophication threatens these functions. Ecologically, lakes support diverse species assemblages, from phytoplankton to top predators, forming complex food webs that are highly sensitive to nutrient imbalances. The loss of biodiversity in these systems often leads to reduced resilience, making them more susceptible to invasive species and regime shifts. Societally, healthy aquatic ecosystems underpin industries such as tourism and agriculture, while also providing drinking water and flood regulation.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 1: chapter structure\n\nThe global economic value of ecosystem services derived from lakes surpasses billions of dollars annually, highlighting the critical importance of these services for environmental health and human well-being. This underscores the urgent need for their preservation to ensure sustainable water management and biodiversity enhancement, particularly in regions facing water scarcity and quality challenges. Rehabilitation efforts must address both ecological and socio-economic dimensions, integrating scientific knowledge with stakeholder engagement to ensure sustainable outcomes. Emerging approaches, such as nature-based solutions like constructed wetlands and adaptive management frameworks, emphasize the critical interconnectedness of ecological health and human well-being.\n\nThese approaches demonstrate how sustainable water management practices can enhance biodiversity, improve water quality, and provide significant economic benefits, as evidenced by cost-benefit analyses conducted in various regions. By restoring degraded lakes, societies can safeguard these irreplaceable resources for future generations while mitigating the escalating costs of environmental degradation. The integration of ecological restoration with community involvement and policy frameworks is essential for achieving long-term sustainability in aquatic ecosystems.

      "content": "Eutrophication poses significant threats to aquatic ecosystems, particularly shallow lakes, which are among the most numerous and vulnerable ecosystems globally. The primary challenge lies in water quality degradation, characterized by excessive algal blooms, hypoxia, and the proliferation of toxic cyanobacteria, which disrupt ecosystem functioning and compromise human water uses. Nutrient overenrichment, primarily from phosphorus and nitrogen inputs, accelerates these processes, leading to shifts in dominant species and reduced biodiversity. The loss of aquatic biodiversity is exacerbated by eutrophication-induced regime shifts, where clear-water states transition to turbid, algae-dominated conditions, often irreversibly.\n\nThe shifts in ecosystem dynamics lead to a reduction in habitat complexity, which in turn diminishes fish populations and disrupts benthic communities, ultimately destabilizing food webs and compromising the ecological balance of shallow lake ecosystems. This destabilization is particularly evident in turbid shallow lakes, where non-linear dynamics and the absence of dynamic environmental changes hinder the transition to a healthier clear-water state. Moreover, management strategies such as biomanipulation, which involve fish removal and nutrient reduction, have been shown to effectively restore ecosystem stability and enhance biodiversity. These strategies highlight the critical interconnections within these aquatic systems, as effective management must consider both biological interactions and nutrient dynamics.\n\nAdditionally, eutrophication undermines ecosystem services such as water purification, recreational value, and fisheries productivity, leading to cascading socio-economic consequences. Managing eutrophication is complicated by the nonlinear responses of aquatic systems to nutrient reductions, requiring long-term monitoring and adaptive strategies. The persistence of legacy nutrients in sediments further delays recovery, necessitating integrated approaches that combine in-lake interventions with watershed-scale nutrient management. Addressing the challenges of balancing ecological restoration with sustainable water use requires interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly in the context of innovative solutions such as constructed wetlands.\n\nThese solutions have been shown to effectively manage water quality and availability while enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem services. This approach is increasingly vital in water-scarce regions, like the Mediterranean, where climate change exacerbates water management issues. A comprehensive understanding of ecological dynamics and the integration of diverse expert knowledge are essential to develop sustainable practices that can effectively mitigate the impacts of eutrophication.",

      "content": "Eutrophication is a complex ecological phenomenon marked by excessive nutrient enrichment, primarily nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), which accelerates primary productivity and degrades aquatic ecosystems [1]. This process has significant implications for biodiversity and water quality, involving intricate biological and chemical interactions, such as nutrient cycling, algal bloom formation, and oxygen depletion. Anthropogenic nutrient inputs from agricultural runoff, wastewater discharge, and atmospheric deposition disrupt natural cycles, favoring phytoplankton and macrophyte proliferation. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for devising effective management strategies to mitigate eutrophication’s detrimental impacts.\n\nLiebig’s Law of the Minimum significantly influences eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems, where phosphorus often limits primary producer growth, leading to ecosystem shifts [1, 2]. Elevated phosphorus levels trigger rapid algal growth, forming blooms that reduce water clarity and inhibit submerged vegetation. Microbial decomposition of senescent blooms consumes oxygen, causing hypoxic conditions detrimental to aquatic life. These cascading effects highlight the need for comprehensive mitigation approaches.\n\nChemically, eutrophication involves nutrient transformations through redox reactions, sedimentation, and resuspension. Phosphorus binds with iron under oxic conditions but is released under anoxia, perpetuating nutrient availability. Nitrogen cycling, mediated by nitrification and denitrification, complicates eutrophication dynamics, with nitrate acting as both nutrient and pollutant. Nonlinear responses of shallow lakes to nutrient loading, as noted by [1], pose challenges in managing eutrophication due to hysteresis effects and alternative stable states.\n\nEmerging research underscores microbial communities and food web interactions in modulating eutrophication outcomes. Zooplankton grazing can suppress algal biomass, while invasive species may exacerbate nutrient cycling inefficiencies. Advanced modeling frameworks, such as fuzzy cognitive mapping, can capture epistemic uncertainties and stakeholder perspectives, enhancing ecosystem management [1]. Integrating these insights informs innovative strategies for restoring and preserving aquatic ecosystems.",

Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration is fundamental, with levels below $2 ~ \\mathrm { m g / L }$ indicating hypoxic conditions harmful to aquatic life. Nutrient concentrations, specifically total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN), are critical indicators of eutrophication severity, with established thresholds linked to oligotrophic conditions [2, 1].\n\nChlorophyll-a (Chl-a) measurements indicate phytoplankton biomass, with concentrations above 10 $\\mathrm { g / L }$ signaling eutrophic conditions prone to harmful algal blooms. Effective management strategies, such as biomanipulation, can shift systems from turbid to clear-water states, mitigating risks associated with high Chl-a levels [2, 1]. Secchi disk depth quantifies water clarity, with values under 1 meter correlating with high turbidity in nutrient-enriched systems. Biological metrics, like the Benthic Quality Index (BQI) and phytoplankton community composition, assess ecological integrity by tracking species diversity shifts.\n\nEmerging approaches use isotopic tracers to differentiate nutrient sources and quantify food web assimilation pathways. Advanced remote sensing techniques enable spatial-temporal monitoring of water quality parameters at landscape scales. Multi-criteria indices, such as the Water Quality Index (WQI) and Trophic State Index (TSI), facilitate standardized comparisons across aquatic systems, informing water management practices, particularly in constructed wetlands [2, 1].\n\nChallenges persist in reconciling metric variability with ecosystem dynamics, particularly in shallow lakes where wind-driven resuspension complicates interpretations [1].

      "content": "Eutrophication in lakes is chiefly driven by anthropogenic inputs of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N), the primary limiting nutrients in freshwater. Agricultural activities, including fertilizer and manure application, contribute $40 \\%$ of nutrient loads, with intensive farming exacerbating phosphorus mobilization through erosion and runoff. Research employing fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) indicates that without interventions like nutrient reduction, shallow lakes remain in a turbid state. Constructed wetlands have emerged as effective solutions for mitigating nutrient pollution, enhancing biodiversity, and improving water quality amid climate change and water scarcity challenges [2, 1].\n\nUrban wastewater is another significant nutrient source, with untreated sewage introducing bioavailable phosphorus and nitrogen into water bodies. Combined sewer overflows during heavy rainfall exacerbate nutrient fluxes, while septic systems in peri-urban areas contribute to groundwater contamination. Industrial effluents from food processing, pulp and paper, and chemical sectors add nutrients and organic matter, increasing microbial oxygen demand. Constructed wetlands have been proposed as effective management strategies to mitigate these impacts by enhancing pollutant removal and promoting biodiversity [2, 1].\n\n[Image]\nFigure 2: This figure illustrates the hierarchical structure of the causes and impacts of eutrophication, detailing the primary anthropogenic sources, ecological effects, and economic consequences. The diagram highlights the interconnectedness of environmental, ecological, and socio-economic factors, emphasizing the need for comprehensive management strategies to mitigate nutrient pollution and restore aquatic ecosystems.\n\nAtmospheric deposition of nitrogen oxides (NO) and ammonia (NH) from fossil fuel combustion and livestock operations accounts for $10 { - } 3 0 \\%$ of nitrogen inputs in sensitive watersheds. Climate change alters precipitation patterns and increases extreme rainfall, enhancing runoff and nutrient loading. Legacy nutrients in sediments pose challenges, as internal loading under anoxic conditions can sustain eutrophication despite reduced external inputs. The relative contribution of these sources varies geographically, with agriculture dominant in temperate zones and wastewater more impactful in rapidly urbanizing tropical regions [2]. Emerging research highlights microplastic-associated nutrient fluxes as an additional vector, with plastic particles facilitating nutrient retention and transport [1].\n\nAddressing nutrient emissions requires watershed-specific management strategies that incorporate hydrological connectivity, land-use practices, and socio-economic conditions. Strategies should be informed by models like fuzzy cognitive mapping, capturing complex ecosystem dynamics. Naturebased solutions, such as constructed wetlands, can enhance water quality and biodiversity while providing economic benefits.

      "content": "Eutrophication significantly impacts aquatic biodiversity, food webs, and ecosystem functioning. Nutrient enrichment stimulates primary productivity, leading to cyanobacteria-dominated blooms that outcompete other algae and reduce species diversity. These blooms decrease water transparency, reducing light penetration essential for submerged macrophytes, shifting ecosystems from macrophyte- to phytoplankton-dominated states, often with lower water quality and increased turbidity. Such transitions highlight the importance of balanced nutrient levels and disturbance management in shallow lakes to maintain ecological integrity [2, 1]. The loss of macrophyte habitats diminishes biodiversity by reducing refuge and spawning grounds for fish and invertebrates.\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 3, which categorizes the hierarchical impacts of eutrophication on ecological systems, the effects can be broadly divided into changes in biodiversity and habitat, disruptions in food webs, and alterations in ecosystem functioning. Eutrophication disrupts food webs, favoring simplified trophic pathways. Zooplankton communities shift from larger-bodied grazers to smaller species, reducing top-down control on phytoplankton. This shift can lead to turbid states, as indicated by ecological models showing the necessity of disturbances like biomanipulation to restore clearwater states [2, 1]. Fish assemblages transition from piscivorous to planktivorous and omnivorous species, altering predation pressures and energy flows. Toxic cyanobacteria introduce allelopathic compounds that disrupt grazing and microbial loops, stabilizing turbid conditions.\n\nEcosystem functioning is compromised through multiple pathways. Hypoxia from organic matter decomposition eliminates oxygen-sensitive species, creating dead zones. Nutrient cycling becomes imbalanced, with enhanced denitrification under anoxic conditions leading to nitrogen loss, while phosphorus recycling from sediments perpetuates eutrophication. The loss of benthic-pelagic coupling reduces nutrient retention, increasing export downstream [1]. Regime shifts exhibit hysteresis, making recovery difficult even after nutrient reductions. Emerging research highlights microbial communities’ role in mediating impacts, with eutrophication altering bacterioplankton composition and function.\n\nFuture research should adopt a multi-trophic approach to enhance predictions of ecosystem responses and identify effective restoration leverage points. Studies on fuzzy cognitive mapping in shallow lakes and constructed wetlands in Italy emphasize understanding complex ecological interactions. Integrating diverse management strategies is crucial for improving ecosystem health and resilience, emphasizing adaptive frameworks for dynamic aquatic ecosystems [2, 1].\n\n[Image]\nFigure 3: This figure illustrates the hierarchical impacts of eutrophication on ecological systems, categorizing the effects into biodiversity and habitat changes, food web disruptions, and ecosystem functioning alterations.",

Commercial fisheries suffer productivity losses as hypoxia reduces fish stocks and alters species composition, with $30 \\%$ declines in yields from affected lakes. Recreational fisheries face parallel declines, with valuation studies indicating a $20 \\%$ reduction in angler participation and expenditures in nutrient-impaired waters. These economic impacts highlight the urgent need for comprehensive management strategies to reduce nutrient inputs and restore aquatic ecosystems.\n\nTourism economies suffer from aesthetic degradation and water use restrictions. Cyanobacterial blooms reduce shoreline property values by $10 { - } 3 0 \\%$ and cause annual losses of $\\$ 1-4$ million in lakeside communities due to decreased visitors. Recreational water closures due to toxic blooms compound these losses, with health advisory days negatively correlating with tourism revenue. Cultural ecosystem services, including spiritual and recreational uses by indigenous communities, are similarly eroded, though underquantified in economic assessments [2, 1].\n\nPublic health costs rise due to water treatment challenges and disease burdens. Cyanotoxin exposure through drinking water or recreation increases hospitalization rates for liver and neurological disorders, raising treatment costs by $1 5 - 2 5 \\%$ in affected regions. Constructed wetlands have shown potential in improving water quality and reducing pollutant levels, mitigating health impacts [2, 1]. Nitrogen pollution in groundwater elevates methemoglobinemia risks in infants, necessitating additional healthcare investments. The World Health Organization attributes 60,000 annual premature deaths globally to harmful algal bloom toxins, with healthcare costs exceeding $\\$ 800$ million.\n\nIndirect economic consequences include increased water treatment costs, with municipalities facing $30 \\%$ higher operational expenses for nutrient removal and disinfection byproduct control [2]. Insurance premiums rise for waterfront properties due to elevated flood risks from macrophyte die-offs reducing wave attenuation capacity [1]. Emerging evidence suggests cognitive function impairments in children exposed to algal neurotoxins may translate into long-term productivity losses, though these pathways require further economic valuation.\n\nThe spatial distribution of these costs is heterogeneous, with developing regions bearing disproportionate burdens due to limited wastewater infrastructure and adaptive capacity. Benefit-cost analyses indicate that investments in eutrophication mitigation, such as constructed wetlands, can yield return ratios of 3:1 to 12:1 when considering avoided damages across sectors. For instance, in Emilia Romagna, constructed wetlands achieved a benefit-cost ratio of 10, highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing environmental and economic outcomes [2, 1]. Future economic assessments must incorporate non-market valuation techniques to fully capture cultural and existence value losses associated with degraded aquatic ecosystems.",

Dredging, a prevalent physical technique, removes nutrient-rich sediments to reduce internal phosphorus loading, though it incurs significant costs (\\$5 to $\\$ 50$ per cubic meter) and can disrupt benthic habitats. Its efficacy is further limited by sediment resuspension and partial nutrient removal, particularly in shallow systems. In contrast, constructed wetlands offer a more sustainable solution, improving biodiversity and mitigating nutrient pollution effectively.\n\nChemical treatments, utilizing aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) salts, precipitate dissolved phosphorus and form binding barriers at the sediment-water interface. Aluminum sulfate (alum) applications initially achieve $70 – 9 0 \\%$ phosphorus reduction, but effectiveness diminishes over time due to sediment mixing. These treatments pose risks of aluminum toxicity and require repeated applications, increasing costs and ecological risks. Calcium hydroxide (lime) treatments, while effective short-term, can raise water $\\mathrm { p H }$ levels, threatening aquatic species. Careful consideration of these treatments is necessary to mitigate ecological impacts.\n\nAeration and oxygenation systems, such as hypolimnetic aerators, aim to maintain aerobic conditions, suppressing phosphorus release. These systems increase dissolved oxygen by $2 { \\cdot } 4 ~ \\mathrm { m g / L }$ but are constrained by high energy demands and limited coverage in large lakes. Diffuser systems often fail to eliminate anoxic conditions in deeper layers, allowing phosphorus mobilization. This highlights the need for integrated approaches combining multiple techniques for sustainable outcomes.\n\nBiomanipulation through fish stock management seeks to control phytoplankton biomass by reintroducing piscivores or reducing planktivores. Success varies, with failures due to incomplete food web restructuring and insufficient external nutrient control. This technique requires continuous monitoring and adaptation, emphasizing the need for tailored strategies based on specific ecological contexts.\n\nThese traditional methods face limitations, including high costs, temporary effectiveness, and neglect of watershed-scale nutrient sources. Many address symptoms rather than causes, leading to recurrent issues unless combined with comprehensive nutrient reduction strategies. Emerging hybrid approaches aim to integrate traditional techniques with novel technologies and watershed management frameworks. Future refinements should emphasize lifecycle cost-benefit analyses and ecological risk assessments to select appropriate techniques tailored to specific lake conditions and restoration goals.",

Lake Washington, USA, achieved a $90 \\%$ reduction in phosphorus inputs through sewage diversion, resulting in a $70 \\%$ decline in phytoplankton biomass and improved water transparency. This case underscores the importance of addressing external nutrient loads for sustained recovery.\n\nIn Europe, Lake Veluwe in the Netherlands exemplified the integration of biomanipulation and phosphorus control, facilitating a transition to a clearwater state. Following a $7 5 \\%$ reduction in phosphorus loading, fish removal enabled a trophic cascade, reducing phytoplankton biomass and promoting macrophyte recovery. This success highlights the importance of timing in restoration sequencing, as biomanipulation proved effective only after sufficient nutrient load reduction.\n\nLake Taihu, China, showcases modified dredging and algal bloom harvesting achieving localized improvements despite persistent watershed pressures. In Gonghu Bay, sediment dredging reduced phosphorus loading, while algae removal extracted significant nutrient quantities. Constructed wetlands further enhanced ecological health, illustrating targeted interventions’ benefits in complex systems.\n\nEmerging success stories from developing regions demonstrate cost-effective adaptations of conventional techniques. Lake Chivero, Zimbabwe, reduced algal biomass by integrating floating wetland islands and community-based management, significantly lowering costs. Lake Nainital, India, combined sediment capping with local clay and citizen science monitoring, reducing phosphorus release economically. These cases highlight innovative, localized solutions’ potential in diverse contexts.\n\nThese cases emphasize critical success factors: external nutrient control, customized interventions based on lake conditions, and adaptive management frameworks integrating scientific monitoring and stakeholder engagement.

Chemical treatments risk non-target effects, including aluminum toxicity and disruption of nutrient-cycling microbial communities. Mechanical aeration systems can alter thermal stratification and fragment habitats. Biomanipulation often fails to account for omnivorous fish resilience, leading to short-lived trophic cascades. These risks necessitate a comprehensive understanding of potential ecological consequences.\n\nSpatial and temporal scalability challenges exist. Dredging is impractical for large, deep lakes, while chemical treatments are economically unfeasible for extensive water bodies. Many methods focus on symptoms rather than underlying nutrient inputs from watersheds, perpetuating degradation cycles. Effective management strategies should integrate innovative solutions like biomanipulation and constructed wetlands, addressing root causes and enhancing ecosystem resilience.\n\nTechnological limitations hinder precise application and monitoring. Chemical dosing often overlooks spatial heterogeneity, and post-treatment monitoring lacks sensitivity for subtle ecological changes. This inadequacy is concerning in complex ecosystems like shallow lakes, where nonlinear dynamics necessitate nuanced understanding. Robust monitoring is essential for capturing ecological responses and informing decision-making.\n\nEmerging research highlights climate vulnerability.

Fuzzy cognitive mapping can enhance biofilter design by integrating expert knowledge on hydrology, microbiology, and nutrient cycling [1]. Nutrient trading programs use market-based mechanisms where polluters purchase credits from entities reducing nutrient loads beyond regulatory requirements, achieving cost savings of $30 \\%$ compared to uniform standards. Challenges include quantifying nutrient loads and ensuring ecological integrity. Fuzzy cognitive maps can support trading program design by modeling stakeholder perceptions of fairness and risk [1].

Traditional methods, while beneficial, often fall short when used in isolation, underscoring the need for a multidisciplinary approach that combines physical, chemical, and biological techniques with innovative governance models. The evolution of ecosystem rehabilitation discourse, enriched by insights from diverse fields, enhances both theoretical understanding and practical application, allowing for tailored solutions to specific ecological scenarios.\n\nThe survey identifies the intricate dynamics of shallow lake ecosystems, where regime shifts and hysteresis present significant challenges to restoration. Nutrient reduction emerges as a fundamental aspect of recovery, with constructed wetlands and nature-based solutions providing cost-effective and multifunctional benefits. Successful interventions are characterized by the integration of scientific monitoring and stakeholder involvement, employing adaptive management to navigate ecological uncertainties. This collaborative approach not only improves restoration outcomes but also fosters community engagement, enhancing the prospects for sustained success. Adaptive management principles allow for responsive strategies, ensuring restoration efforts remain effective amidst changing conditions.\n\nInnovative interdisciplinary tools, such as fuzzy cognitive mapping, offer valuable frameworks for integrating diverse knowledge systems in ecosystem management. The economic valuation of ecosystem services further supports restoration investments, demonstrating the superior cost-effectiveness of nature-based solutions over traditional infrastructure. However, geographical differences in technique effectiveness require context-specific adaptations, especially as climate change impacts hydrological patterns. Localized studies are crucial for informing broader strategies, ensuring interventions are ecologically and socio-economically viable. As climate change continues to affect ecosystems, understanding local dynamics is vital for effective management and restoration.\n\nFuture research should focus on developing hybrid models that integrate ecological processes with socio-economic factors to enhance predictive capabilities and implementation success. The combination of advanced monitoring technologies and participatory governance structures shows promise for expanding successful interventions across varied lake ecosystems. Ultimately, sustainable water management demands a systems-thinking approach that harmonizes ecological goals with human needs through collaborative, science-driven decision-making. This approach cultivates resilience in aquatic ecosystems, enabling them to adapt to both human-induced pressures and natural changes, thus safeguarding their ecological integrity for future generations. Restoration science must continue to embrace complexity and uncertainty, fostering innovative solutions to future challenges.",
