The process begins with biomass depolymerization via hydrolysis, where water acts as both solvent and reactant, breaking down cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin into soluble oligomers and monomers like sugars, phenols, and fatty acids [1]. These intermediates undergo dehydration, decarboxylation, and deamination, forming smaller reactive compounds. Dehydration and decarboxylation reduce oxygen content, enhancing the energy density of the bio-oil. Repolymerization through condensation and cyclization reactions generates higher-molecular-weight compounds, including aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrogen-containing heterocycles. Alkali and heterogeneous catalysts, such as KCO and Ni/AlO, accelerate these pathways, promoting hydrogen transfer and reducing char formation [1].\n\nWater’s decreased dielectric constant at elevated temperatures enhances solvation power, facilitating homogeneous reaction environments.
