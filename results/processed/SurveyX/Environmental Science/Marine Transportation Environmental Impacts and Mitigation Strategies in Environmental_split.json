These changes particularly affect coastal communities relying on marine resources. As stressors on marine species intensify, entire ecosystems face jeopardy, leading to cascading effects that challenge sustainability. Shipping contributes significantly to these pressures through greenhouse gas emissions, underwater noise pollution, and invasive species from ballast water discharge, which disrupt ecosystems and economies. Although ballast water regulations aim to mitigate these risks, they can increase shipping costs, impacting Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Emissions from shipping, especially in regions like the North and Baltic Seas, include pollutants such as CO2 and NOx, posing health risks and contributing to social costs [2, 3, 4]. These stressors lead to declines in keystone species and habitat collapse, with regional studies showing compounded effects on ocean acidification in high-traffic corridors. The complex feedback loops between climate change and shipping activities necessitate integrated strategies that align maritime practices with conservation goals to prevent further biodiversity loss.",
