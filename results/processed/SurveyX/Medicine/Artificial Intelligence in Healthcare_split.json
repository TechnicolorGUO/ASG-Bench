The accuracycoverage tradeoff remains a critical issue, demanding models that adequately balance individual prediction precision against comprehensive population coverage [49].\n\nData bias has broader implications, such as perpetuating health disparities across demographically diverse groups. If AI models are predominantly trained on data representing certain populations, they may inadequately serve underrepresented groups, potentially exacerbating health inequities through misdiagnoses or ineffective treatments [132]. This scenario underscores ethical concerns about fairness and justice, posing additional risks to marginalized communities when deploying AI without sufficient oversight. Counteracting these challenges calls for strategies incorporating diverse datasets and continuous real-world AI system evaluations.\n\nAlgorithmic bias in medical AI stretches across numerous dimensions, particularly in diagnostics where balancing high prediction accuracy and clinical interpretability is challenging.

While it aims to produce high-quality, coherent, and comprehensive surveys with accurate citations, the final output is derived from the AI’s synthesis of pre-processed materials, which may contain limitations or inaccuracies. As such, the generated content should not be used for academic publication or formal submissions and must be independently reviewed and verified. The developers of SurveyX do not assume responsibility for any errors or consequences arising from the use of the generated surveys.",
