      "content": "Adolescent well-being encompasses psychological, emotional, and social dimensions, with positive psychology providing strategies to enhance these aspects through resilience, strengths, and flourishing. Resilience, the ability to adapt positively to adversity, is crucial during adolescence, a stage marked by unique challenges and stressors, with over $7 5 \\%$ of mental health disorders manifesting before age 25 [1, 2]. Many adolescents with high levels of depression or anxiety do not seek support, highlighting resilience as a pivotal factor in navigating these years [2, 2]. Strengths-based approaches focus on cultivating talents and virtues like creativity and perseverance, serving as protective factors against distress.\n\nFlourishing, characterized by positive emotions, engagement, and purpose, is a key outcome in youth mental health interventions, emphasizing the presence of positive states rather than just the absence of illness. Traditional assessment methods often fail to capture the dynamic nature of these constructs [1]. Dynamic modeling techniques are needed to accurately represent resilience and flourishing trajectories, allowing for tailored interventions that respond to adolescents’ evolving experiences.\n\nIntegrating these concepts into interventions requires developmental appropriateness and cultural relevance. Strengths identification exercises must align with adolescents’ cognitive and social maturity, while resilience-building activities should address both individual and systemic stressors. Emerging research suggests that neurodynamic modeling could enhance well-being assessments by accounting for temporal fluctuations in psychological states [1]. Future directions include refining these models to incorporate contextual factors like school climate and peer relationships, significantly influencing adolescent well-being outcomes.",

This is particularly relevant in school-based interventions, where academic stressors introduce additional confounding variables [1]. Neurodynamic approaches offer promising avenues for refining resilience models, with techniques like -machine reconstruction enabling precise tracking of microstate transitions in brain activity [1]. Dynamic functional network analysis can elucidate trauma-related neural plasticity, informing intervention design [2].\n\nDigital phenotyping enhances dynamic modeling by integrating active and passive data streams to predict mental health trajectories [1]. This approach allows real-time monitoring of adolescents’ psychological states, providing insights into resilience and well-being.
