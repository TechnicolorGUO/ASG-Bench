Section 2.2 introduces HRV as a critical biomarker of autonomic function, emphasizing its relevance in both clinical and research settings. Historical milestones in HRV research are contextualized in Section 2.3, bridging early discoveries to contemporary applications in psychological stress assessment, thereby illustrating the evolution of this field [1].\n\n[Image]\nFigure 1: chapter structure\n\nThe subsequent sections delve into the core concepts that underpin this review. Section 3 defines these core concepts, including the branches of the ANS (Section 3.1) and their roles in stress and emotion regulation (Section 3.2). The theoretical models that explain these relationships are discussed in Section 3.3, providing a robust framework for understanding how autonomic processes influence mental health. This section is pivotal as it lays the groundwork for the empirical evidence presented in later sections, illustrating the theoretical underpinnings that support the observed phenomena.\n\nSections 46 synthesize empirical evidence that highlights the multifaceted relationship between HRV and mental health. Section 4 evaluates HRV as a stress biomarker, integrating methodologies from recent studies that have advanced our understanding of this relationship [2]. Following this, Section 5 explores HRV’s role in emotion regulation, leveraging insights gained from wearable technologies that allow for real-time monitoring and assessment of autonomic function [3].

      "content": "The autonomic nervous system (ANS) governs involuntary physiological processes through the sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) branches. The SNS, activated under stress, enhances cardiac output and metabolism via catecholamine release, while the PNS supports restorative processes like digestion through cholinergic pathways [5]. Heart rate variability (HRV) serves as a biomarker for ANS modulation of cardiac rhythm [6]. Anatomically, the ANS consists of central nuclei, such as the hypothalamus and brainstem, and peripheral ganglia and effector organs. The SNS originates from thoracolumbar spinal segments, synapsing in paravertebral and prevertebral ganglia, whereas the PNS arises from cranial nerves, notably the vagus, and sacral spinal segments [7]. Functionally, SNS activation increases heart rate via $\\beta$ -adrenergic receptors, while PNS activation decreases it through muscarinic receptors, modulating vagal tone [8].\n\nDysregulation of ANS balance leads to altered HRV patterns and hemodynamic instability, impacting cardiovascular and psychological health [9]. HRV assessment employs spectral analysis, dividing variance into high-frequency $\\mathrm { H F } ; 0 . 1 5 0 . 4 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ , PNS-dominated) and low-frequency (LF; $0 . 0 4 0 . 1 5 \\mathrm { H z }$ , baroreflex-mediated) bands [10]. Nonlinear dynamics, including $1 / f$ scaling, further elucidate ANS modulation [3]. Emerging methodologies like ballistocardiography (BCG) offer noninvasive ANS monitoring during sleep [11], while entropy-based approaches quantify baroreflex regulation [12]. Advancements in these techniques promise enhanced understanding and monitoring of autonomic function.\n\nFuture research emphasizes integrative approaches, such as nonlinear classification for arrhythmia risk stratification [13] and real-time cognitive load assessment via ANS metrics [14]. These insights hold potential for novel clinical interventions and improved patient outcomes.",

      "content": "Heart rate variability (HRV) measures the fluctuations in heartbeat intervals, reflecting autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation [6]. HRV arises from the interplay between sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) inputs, with SNS accelerating heart rate via $\\beta .$ -adrenergic signaling and PNS decelerating it through vagal efferent activity [9]. HRV’s physiological basis lies in baroreflexmediated cardiovascular control, with high-frequency (HF; $0 . 1 5 0 . 4 \\mathrm { H z }$ ) oscillations indicating respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and PNS modulation, and low-frequency (LF; $0 . 0 4 0 . 1 5 \\mathrm { H z }$ ) components reflecting baroreflex and SNS contributions [15].\n\nHRV metrics are categorized into time-domain (e.g., RMSSD, SDNN), frequency-domain (e.g., LF/HF ratio), and nonlinear measures. Time-domain indices measure beat-to-beat variability, while frequency-domain analysis decomposes variance into spectral bands associated with autonomic function [16]. Nonlinear dynamics, such as detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and entropy-based measures, reveal scale-invariant properties and nonstationarity in HRV time series, offering insights into ANS adaptability [17]. Reduced HRV often signals ANS dysfunction, with fractal-like patterns indicating optimal physiological regulation [18]. Advances in methodologies like photoplethysmography (PPG) enable HRV estimation from wearable devices, broadening monitoring capabilities beyond traditional electrocardiography (ECG) [19].\n\nHRV’s clinical significance spans mental health and cardiovascular applications. In mental health, HRV serves as a marker for psychological stress, with reduced variability linked to impaired emotion regulation [20]. Cardiovascular applications utilize HRV for early detection of autonomic dysfunction, though standardization challenges persist across diverse populations [21]. Wearable technologies facilitate remote HRV assessment in everyday environments, while motion-robust algorithms mitigate artifacts [22]. These technologies offer promising avenues for enhancing patient care and monitoring.\n\nFuture research focuses on integrating multimodal physiological signals to enhance HRV’s diagnostic precision. Scalable analysis frameworks must address nonstationarity in longitudinal studies, and standardized guidelines for interpreting HRV parameters remain crucial for clinical adoption [17]. The convergence of wearable technologies and machine learning promises novel applications in personalized medicine and real-time autonomic monitoring.",

Initial studies utilized linear timedomain metrics, such as the standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), to assess autonomic regulation [23]. However, these methods were limited in capturing HRV’s nonlinear and non-stationary dynamics, prompting the adoption of spectral analysis techniques that decomposed variance into frequency bands associated with sympathetic (LF; $0 . 0 4 0 . 1 5 \\mathrm { H z }$ ) and parasympathetic ( $\\mathrm { { I F } ; 0 . 1 5 0 . 4 \\mathrm { { H z } } }$ ) activity [24].\n\nA pivotal advancement was recognizing HRV’s fractal-like properties through nonlinear scaleinvariant analysis [25], revealing long-range correlations indicative of optimal physiological regulation. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) further elucidated these dynamics, showing breakdowns in long-range correlations during pathological states [26]. Innovations in wearable technologies, spurred by limitations of traditional electrocardiography (ECG), enabled continuous HRV monitoring in real-world settings [27].\n\nHRV’s application to psychological stress emerged from evidence linking reduced variability to impaired emotion regulation and heightened stress reactivity [20]. Early stress detection methods used linear HRV metrics, but subsequent research highlighted the need for multimodal approaches integrating respiratory and motion artifacts [22]. Non-invasive techniques, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), expanded HRV’s utility in mental health research, despite standardization challenges [28].\n\nRecent advancements include model-free methods for quantifying memory in neural spike trains, addressing biases in continuous-time HRV analysis [29], and cross-dataset benchmarks evaluating ECG-based deep learning models for stress detection [30]. Virtual reality simulations have advanced mental workload modeling by incorporating HRV with other biosignals [31]. However, unresolved challenges remain, such as HRV’s complex temporal dynamics affecting brain matter [32], and the need for accurate decomposition of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) components [33].\n\nFuture directions emphasize integrating dynamic metrics from photoplethysmographic data [34] and developing efficient inference methods for HRV measurement [35].

      "content": "The autonomic nervous system (ANS) comprises two primary branches: the sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) systems. SNS mediates \"fight-or-flight\" responses through catecholaminergic pathways that increase cardiac output, while PNS supports \"rest-and-digest\" activities via vagal cholinergic efferents [7]. This dynamic balance involves central autonomic nuclei like the hypothalamus and brainstem, which integrate peripheral feedback and higher-order cortical inputs [37]. Their interaction is pivotal for adaptive responses to environmental challenges, maintaining the body’s equilibrium.\n\nCardiovascular regulation exemplifies functional specialization between branches; SNS accelerates the sinoatrial node through $\\beta _ { 1 }$ -adrenergic receptors, while PNS moderates heart rates via muscarinic receptors, analyzed through heart rate variability (HRV) metrics [38]. Distinct anatomical originsSNS from thoracolumbar segments (T1-L2) synapsing at paravertebral ganglia, and PNS from cranial nerves (CN X, IX) and sacral segments (S2-S4)illustrate pathway-specific adjustments [39]. This distinct structure underscores branch functional divergence, demonstrating how pathways react to physiological demands.\n\nThe ANS’s adaptability allows response shifts influenced by emotional states and environmental stimuli; acute stress heightens SNS activity, increasing heart rate and blood pressure, while chronic stress leads to PNS withdrawal linked to cardiovascular disease risks. This dynamic recalibration emphasizes ANS’s critical function in health and disease contexts. Understanding these mechanisms is vital for developing therapeutic strategies targeting autonomic function to enhance psychological and physiological well-being.\n\nThe next section will explore ANS’s implications in psychological stress and emotion regulation, highlighting dysregulation’s impact on emotional health and potential therapeutic restorations aimed at restoring balance.",

This imbalance is measured through HRV metrics, where long-term stress diminishes high-frequency (HF; $0 . 1 5 0 . 4 ~ \\mathrm { H z } \\mathrm { \\Omega }$ ) powera vagal tone indicatorand increases low-frequency (LF; $0 . 0 4 0 . 1 5 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ ) dominance, signaling impaired baroreflex [26]. Chronic ANS dysregulation poses significant health risks, including psychosomatic disorders. Prenatal stress influences induce lifelong ANS dysregulation predispositions through epigenetic modifications [40].\n\nEmotion regulation involves cognitive and physiological control processes modulating emotional reactivity, with ANS activity providing a neural substrate. Vagal-mediated gut-brain signaling influences affective states via PNS pathways [41]. Cognitive reappraisal and acceptance strategies share neural mechanisms affecting prefrontal-amygdala connectivity but differ in effectiveness for those with social anxiety [42]. This complexity illustrates strategic variability, particularly under stress conditions.\n\nInterventions focusing on ANS activity employ HRV biofeedback to boost regulatory capacities. Mindfulness training enhances PNS tone and increases HF-HRV, diminishing perceived stress [43]. Advanced neurofeedback paradigms fortify cortical-autonomic integration, overcoming constraints of isolated brain activity assessments [44]. Hybrid models, combining HRV with electrodermal data, improve emotion recognition, albeit traditional frameworks underperform in minority groups due to metric non-standardization [45]. Future directions prioritize dynamic HRV monitoring via wearable photoplethysmography and integrating memory-emotion interactions [29]. Developmental research standardization is crucial for individualized ANS-targeted intervention advancements.\n\nThe relationship between psychological stress and emotion regulation underscores the need to understand how ANS dynamics affect emotional health.

The hierarchical model [46] articulates HRV’s multifractal nature, differentiating physiological states through scale-invariant ANS regulation signatures. This coincides with discrete scale invariance theory [47], formalizing scaling factors in cardiovascular dynamics and elucidating stress-related autonomic dysregulation mechanisms.\n\nChaos quantification in HRV series is accomplished using the Chaos Decision Tree Algorithm [48], pinpointing nonlinear sympathetic-parasympathetic imbalance signatures during psychological stress. Multifractal analyses, such as Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM), break down HRV into LF, VLF, and ULF components, showcasing unique scaling properties linked to ANS adaptability [49]. Empirical studies indicate linear HRV descriptors’ non-ergodicity, contrasting with cascade-dynamical approaches yielding reproducible mental health biomarkers [50]. These findings emphasize advanced analytical techniques’ importance in capturing ANS complexity and mental health implications.\n\nNetwork neuroscience frameworks extend these models by integrating structural connectivity. The structure-preserving symmetric graph kernel (SSGK) [51] refines brain-ANS interaction classification via tensor products, capturing nonlinear neuroautonomic coupling. Complementary to this is the Component Process Model [52], mapping HRV fluctuations to specific affective states, merging psychological theories and ANS dynamics. The Vector AutoRegressive Fractionally Integrated (VARFI) framework [10] quantifies multiscale interactions among heart period, arterial pressure, and respiration, elucidating neurocardiac feedback loops. These integrative models comprehensively reveal system interactions shaping emotional and physiological outcomes.\n\nUnsupervised learning dissects emotion regulation neural substrates, identifying prefrontalamygdala connectivity patterns for strategy adaptiveness [53]. Model-free entropy measures [29] enhance continuous-time HRV analysis by minimizing discretization biases, while spectral analyses uncover ANS dynamics’ unexplained periodic phenomena [? ]. Future advancement paths advocate for chaos theory-graph neural representation hybrids to personalize brain-heart axis interventions.

The DeepBeat framework demonstrates multitask capabilities for arrhythmia detection and signal denoising [123]. Wearables now incorporate advanced HRV analytics, with single-lead ECG patches enabling continuous autonomic assessment and hybrid sensor arrays allowing motion-robust HRV estimation during activity [22]. These systems leverage federated learning for privacy-preserving personalized ANS classification across networks.\n\nNon-contact monitoring modalities represent a frontier in HRV technology, with camera-based systems achieving sub-millimeter precision in detecting cardiac-synchronous facial blood flow variations [70]. Vehicular integration, through systems like V2iFi, enables driver state monitoring via impulse radio analysis, creating applications in transportation safety [69]. Emerging computational paradigms address HRV analysis challenges, with persistent homology extracting topological features and ordinal pattern network analysis capturing nonlinear dynamics [112]. These innovations, complemented by edge computing, enable real-time HRV processing on low-power devices, enhancing responsive health interventions.\n\nFuture directions emphasize integrating these technologies into health ecosystems. Machine learning frameworks must tackle generalization challenges across populations, as demonstrated by successful ECG noise detection [95, 67]. Standardization efforts ensure comparability of wearablederived HRV metrics, with regulatory guidelines for autonomic monitoring. Integrating HRV with environmental and behavioral context through IoMT architectures promises novel applications in preventive medicine and personalized stress management.",

The generalizability of findings is often compromised by the use of small sample sizes or specialized populations, which can skew HRV data interpretations when applied in broader clinical contexts [16]. The vagal contributions observed in fetal HRV studies underscore the complexity of developing universal assessment protocols [37].\n\nTechnological constraints, such as those seen in systems like V2iFi, which exhibit performance degradation under challenging conditions [69], present substantial variability challenges in HRV analysis. Video-based HRV estimation suffers from reduced accuracy under complex motion or poor lighting conditions [22]. Advanced imaging techniques and machine learning algorithms may alleviate these issues, but network visualization techniques still need refinement to understand physiological mechanisms [55].\n\nAnalytical challenges include the nonstationary nature of autonomic responses, which complicates HRV data interpretation. Reinforcement learning frameworks face limitations due to variability in autonomic reactivity [73]. Assumptions of conditional stationarity in methodologies like the Specific Differential Entropy Rate estimator are frequently violated [54], while rapid trend variations impede spectral detrended fluctuation analysis [17].\n\nFuture research should focus on large-scale validation studies, adaptive methodologies for nonstationary data, and signal processing techniques that consider environmental and physiological confounders. Adaptive algorithms integrating contextual information such as accelerometer data are essential for consistent HRV measurements across diverse populations [117, 124, 91, 119, 42].",

Noise in ECG signals from wearables further complicates analysis and heightens misdiagnosis risk [67].\n\nChallenges in data acquisition methodologies include preprocessing requirements for high-quality ECG recordings [33], and limitations of wearables in sleep studies where HRV fails to capture multidimensional sleep quality parameters [126]. Self-reported ground truth data introduces bias in emotion regulation studies, affecting machine learning model performance.\n\nTechnical artifacts require more robust analytical techniques. Motion-induced noise affects ambulatory monitoring [22], while statistical models vary in prediction accuracy due to nonstationary dynamics and demographic variations [18]. The need for standardized protocols in digital emotion regulation underscores methodological gaps [81].\n\nStrategies for improvement involve multimodal validation frameworks.

Enhancements in machine learning for vehicular platforms like V2iFi are critical for comprehensive state inference [69], while expanding validation across diverse PPG sources solidifies standardized analysis pipelines [127].\n\nClinical translation of nonlinear HRV measures demands rigorous validation for psychiatric disorder diagnostics. Studies need to establish diagnostic thresholds for depression detection, exploring autonomic signatures through cardiology-psychiatry collaborations. Investigating vagus nerve stimulation effects on neonates will inform integrated assessment protocols for early-life dysfunction.\n\nStandardization in methodology remains crucial. Future frameworks should merge laboratory-grade measurements with ecological validity by employing hybrid sensor arrays and context-aware techniques.

      "content": "The survey has elucidated the vital interconnections between autonomic nervous system (ANS) function, heart rate variability (HRV), and mental health, positioning HRV as a pivotal biomarker for assessing psychological stress and emotion regulation. By employing advanced HRV metrics, the hierarchical structure of ANS activity offers a comprehensive framework for deciphering stress-induced autonomic dysregulation and its clinical outcomes. Empirical findings reveal HRV’s responsiveness to both acute and chronic stress conditions, with nonlinear analyses providing superior detection of autonomic instability. The fusion of social media language analysis with physiological stress markers enhances predictive accuracy, yielding novel insights into population-level stress trends and health behaviors. These findings underscore HRV’s role as a critical lens for evaluating and addressing mental health, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches.\n\nTechnological advancements have broadened HRV’s applications beyond traditional laboratory settings. Wearable technologies facilitate continuous monitoring, empowering individuals to track their physiological states in real time and fostering enhanced awareness of mental well-being. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) techniques offer precise HRV measurements from facial videos, paving the way for personalized interventions tailored to individual needs and contexts. Avatarbased interventions demonstrate the potential of personalized digital therapeutics, with customized virtual representations improving engagement and therapeutic outcomes for marginalized groups. Moreover, motion-robust frameworks exhibit superior performance in dynamic environments, expanding the scope of HRV applications and integrating mental health monitoring into daily life.\n\nClinical applications benefit from integrated assessment methodologies that leverage diverse strengths. The Life Potential complexity measure emerges as a promising tool for cognitive analyses and clinical diagnostics, particularly in assessing age-related autonomic changes. This measure provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying mental health disorders, informing treatment strategies. Psychophysiology-aided systems prove effective in differentiating clinical populations, offering potential for real-time analysis and personalized interventions. Additionally, quantitative stress assessment methodologies combining physiological markers with subjective evaluations deliver comprehensive insights into mental stress states, enhancing diagnostic precision and fostering a nuanced understanding of the physiological and psychological interplay in mental health.\n\nFuture research should focus on three key areas: standardizing nonlinear HRV metrics across diverse populations, developing closed-loop biofeedback systems integrating real-time ANS modulation with cognitive interventions, and expanding multimodal monitoring frameworks to capture corticalautonomic interactions. The integration of advanced signal processing techniques with wearable technologies promises to advance personalized medicine through ANS-targeted diagnostics and interventions. Cross-disciplinary collaborations must tackle challenges in ecological validity and measurement standardization, particularly for applications in dynamic real-world environments. By bridging fundamental neurophysiology with technological innovation, this field is poised to significantly enhance our understanding and management of stress-related disorders and mental health conditions, with implications extending beyond academic inquiry to inform public health strategies and improve the quality of life for individuals facing mental health challenges.",
