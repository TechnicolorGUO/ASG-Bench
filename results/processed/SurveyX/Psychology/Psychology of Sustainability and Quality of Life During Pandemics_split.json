Grasping these dynamics is pivotal for crafting interventions and policies that enhance both mental health and sustainable practices. Central to this is the fusion of systems and control theory with environmental psychology, which aids in developing models that capture human-environment interactions [1]. Such models demonstrate the influence of microclimates on health, stress, and emotional well-being, notably in structured settings like educational environments [2]. These insights underscore the necessity of supportive environments for mental well-being.\n\nA significant challenge in this domain is the gap between pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, often due to cognitive dissonance, where conflicting beliefs hinder sustainable actions [3]. Motivational factors further complicate sustainable actions, and the intricate nature of well-being, involving biological, economic, and social (BES) indicators, remains inadequately understood [4]. A comprehensive framework addressing these complexities is crucial for understanding the interplay of factors affecting psychological health and sustainable behaviors.\n\nResilience and adaptation mechanisms are vital, especially in hybrid work settings, with belonging, conflict management, proactiveness, and organizational support being key resilience drivers [5]. These insights align with critiques of sustainability frameworks that often overlook social dimensions, limiting organizational capacity to assess and improve social impact [6]. Integrating psychological insights into sustainability enhances organizational resilience and supports environments that promote both mental health and ecological sustainability.\n\nFuture research should bridge existing gaps by merging behavioral insights with systemic models to understand how psychological and behavioral factors influence mental health and sustainability. This approach is vital for addressing social sustainability, crucial for inclusive societies as outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Tools like the S-Assessment Tool for Social Sustainability can evaluate organizational performance in health, wellness, gender equality, and responsible consumption.

      "content": "Mental health pandemics are intensified by socio-economic disparities and environmental stressors, which together heighten psychological distress. Inequities in resource access and support systems disproportionately affect marginalized groups during health crises, with coordination failures in supply chains further undermining socially responsible practices and community resilience [7]. This lack of coordination not only affects profitability but also hampers the ability to address urgent social needs during pandemics, exacerbating mental health issues. Additionally, limited access to mental health services during critical periods reflects systemic failures that perpetuate disadvantage cycles.\n\nEnvironmental stressors, such as disruptions to microclimates and built environments, exacerbate these socio-economic challenges by impacting emotional arousal and stress levels. The absence of comprehensive frameworks for evaluating social sustainability compounds these issues, as organizations struggle to assess and mitigate their social impact effectively [6]. This oversight perpetuates systemic inequities, leaving communities unprepared to cope with the psychological toll of crises. Moreover, environmental degradation raises anxiety and stress, as individuals face changing landscapes that threaten their security and stability. Addressing these environmental factors is crucial for a holistic mental health approach that encompasses socio-economic and ecological dimensions.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 2: This figure illustrates the key causes and impacts of mental health pandemics, categorized into socio-economic and environmental triggers, and the long-term psychological and community impacts. It highlights the interplay between socio-economic disparities, environmental stressors, and hybrid work environments in exacerbating mental health issues. Additionally, it emphasizes individual psychological well-being, community cohesion, and the amplification of these effects by environmental factors, underscoring the need for integrated and sustainable approaches to mitigate these challenges.\n\nHybrid work environments exemplify the interplay between socio-economic and environmental triggers.

      "content": "The enduring impacts of mental health pandemics manifest as significant disruptions to individual psychological well-being and community cohesion, with consequences lasting beyond the initial crisis. Prolonged exposure to pandemic-related stressors alters cognitive and emotional functioning, increasing chronic anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorders [1]. These conditions are worsened by systemic inequities in resource distribution, which disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, creating persistent mental health disparities [7]. The cumulative impact of these mental health issues can diminish overall quality of life, as individuals struggle with daily challenges and unresolved psychological trauma.\n\nCommunity-level impacts are equally significant, with social fragmentation and eroded trust undermining collective resilience. The decline of spontaneous social interactions in hybrid work environments, for instance, diminishes team cohesion and reduces adaptive capacity, affecting organizational productivity and employee well-being [5]. This fragmentation is compounded by traditional sustainability frameworks’ failure to prioritize social dimensions, leaving communities ill-equipped to address the psychological aftermath of crises [6]. The breakdown of social networks affects mental health and hinders community mobilization and resource sharing, entrenching existing disparities.\n\nEnvironmental factors further amplify these long-term effects, as disruptions to microclimates and built environments perpetuate stress and emotional dysregulation [2]. The bidirectional relationship between human behavior and environmental conditions creates feedback loops that sustain psychological distress, particularly in structured settings like educational institutions. Future research must address these challenges by developing integrated models that capture the interplay between individual resilience, community support systems, and environmental determinants of mental health.

Environmental stimuli directly affect psychological states, while human actions modify environmental conditions, creating feedback loops. For example, the microclimate in built environments impacts stress and emotional arousal, with settings like educational institutions being pivotal in these interactions [2]. Environments with natural light, greenery, and thoughtful spatial organization foster positive emotions and cognitive function, whereas human activities such as urban design and energy use reshape environmental quality, affecting mental health risks.\n\nIntegrating systems and control theory with environmental psychology is essential for modeling these interactions, as it reveals nonlinear dependencies between well-being and environmental variables [1]. Disruptions in microclimates, whether due to pandemics or climate events, propagate through social and psychological systems, intensifying distress. The gap between pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors further complicates this relationship, with cognitive dissonance and motivational barriers impeding sustainable practices that could mitigate mental health impacts [3]. Addressing these complexities is vital for interventions that enhance both environmental sustainability and mental health.\n\nSocial dimensions of sustainability, often neglected in these models, are critical in mediating humanenvironment interactions. Organizations frequently lack metrics to assess social impact, limiting their ability to address inequities exacerbating environmental stressors [6]. Future research should focus on integrated models that consider social determinants, providing a comprehensive understanding of how environmental and behavioral factors influence mental health.

Studies show that high $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ levels in indoor environments correlate with increased emotional arousal and stress, particularly in educational settings where exposure is prolonged [2]. These findings highlight the role of microclimates in cognitive and affective processes, as thermal discomfort and poor air quality disrupt focus and heighten anxiety. Understanding these relationships is crucial for designing environments that reduce negative emotional responses and enhance psychological well-being.\n\nThe interplay between environmental stressors and emotional regulation is complex due to the bidirectional nature of human-environment interactions. Adverse conditions exacerbate distress, yet individual behaviors, such as improving ventilation or finding alternative spaces, can alleviate these effects, demonstrating human agency’s adaptive potential [1]. However, systemic factors, like inadequate infrastructure or socio-economic barriers, often limit these adaptations. This underscores the need for comprehensive approaches that consider individual agency and structural constraints in addressing environmental factors’ psychological impacts.\n\nIntegrating environmental psychology with systems theory uncovers the nonlinear dynamics of these relationships, where minor environmental quality changes can have significant psychological effects [2]. This sensitivity is heightened during pandemics, with confinement in suboptimal environments intensifying emotional dysregulation. Future research should focus on real-time monitoring systems to quantify these effects, enabling targeted interventions that optimize environmental conditions for mental health resilience. Efforts must consider individual response variability, ensuring equitable solutions across diverse populations and contexts.
