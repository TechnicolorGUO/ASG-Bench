A primary issue is the reliance on synthetic datasets for training damage assessment models, which may not fully capture real-world post-earthquake complexities [1]. Although synthetic data generation techniques like generative adversarial networks (GANs) have improved fidelity, discrepancies in material behavior and environmental conditions persist, potentially degrading field performance. This reliance raises questions about model generalizability, as they may not account for the unique and unpredictable nature of actual earthquake events. In seismic data interpolation, texture extraction methods reliant on approximate techniques, such as K-means clustering, may introduce inaccuracies in preserving geological features, affecting hazard assessment reliability [2]. These challenges necessitate sophisticated methods bridging the gap between synthetic training environments and seismic event realities.\n\nModel interpretability remains a barrier, particularly for deep learning architectures in seismic prediction and structural health monitoring. The \"black-box\" nature of these models complicates validation by engineering standards and limits trust in critical decision-making scenarios. Engineers require clear prediction explanations, especially in high-stakes situations where lives and properties are at risk. Additionally, data scarcity in low-seismicity regions complicates accurate predictive model development, as imbalanced datasets may yield biased predictions. This issue is compounded by challenges in seismic data collection, where missing traces are common, and traditional methods often fall short. Innovative approaches like the Seismic U-net InterpolaTor (SUIT) address these challenges by preserving seismic texture information during data reconstruction, enhancing prediction reliability. The use of synthetic datasets for training deep learning models in damage detection following earthquakes demonstrates potential for improved accuracy in assessing structural integrity, particularly in hard-to-survey areas [1, 2]. Computational constraints also pose challenges for realtime applications, where high-frequency seismic data processing demands low-latency inference without accuracy compromise.\n\nEmerging solutions to these challenges are found in interdisciplinary innovations. Hybrid models integrating physics-based simulations with data-driven ML offer promising directions, balancing accuracy with interpretability by embedding domain knowledge into neural network architectures. This integration enhances model performance and fosters a better understanding of underlying physical phenomena.
