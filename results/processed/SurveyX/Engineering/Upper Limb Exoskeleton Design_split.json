These systems significantly enhance rehabilitation outcomes by providing individualized motion planning that adapts to patient-specific needs while ensuring safety during therapeutic exercises [1]. The capability to mimic natural human movements, as demonstrated in bimanual manipulation tasks [2], translates directly to improved mobility restoration in patients with upper limb impairments. The integration of these devices into therapeutic settings not only facilitates physical recovery but also promotes psychological well-being by fostering a sense of independence and agency in patients.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 1: chapter structure\n\nFrom a biomechanical perspective, exoskeletons leverage advanced modeling techniques to accurately represent human dynamics during rehabilitation exercises [3]. This precision is particularly crucial for high-intensity movements that traditional rehabilitation methods often inadequately address. Current systems face limitations in adaptability, as highlighted by [4], where the lack of patient-specific assistance modes reduces therapeutic efficacy. However, emerging designs incorporate user-oriented assessment frameworks [5] to optimize comfort and functionality simultaneously. Such innovations are essential for ensuring that exoskeletons can meet the diverse needs of patients, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable rehabilitation environments.\n\nThe clinical impact extends beyond patient recovery, with exoskeletons substantially reducing therapist workload through automated assistance protocols. By integrating real-time motion adaptation and advanced force control mechanisms, these systems effectively reduce compensatory movements while ensuring that therapeutic intensity is maintained. This approach leverages an Adaptive Integral Terminal Sliding Mode (AITSM) controller, enhanced by Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques, to dynamically adjust to user needs and environmental changes. Such integration not only optimizes the interaction between active and passive joints but also enhances the adaptability and compliance of robotic systems, thereby facilitating more effective rehabilitation and support for individuals with motor impairments. Additionally, the incorporation of compliant control dynamics allows for precise trajectory generation, ultimately improving the overall efficacy of therapeutic interventions [6, 7, 8]. The dual benefit of enhanced patient outcomes and reduced clinical resource requirements positions exoskeletons as pivotal tools in modern rehabilitation paradigms, bridging the gap between therapeutic requirements and engineering solutions.\n\nThe significance of assistive exoskeletons in rehabilitation engineering cannot be overstated, as they represent a convergence of technology and patient-centered care. By addressing the multifaceted challenges of rehabilitation, these devices not only facilitate physical recovery but also enhance the overall therapeutic experience.

      "content": "The design of assistive exoskeletons for upper limb rehabilitation presents a complex interplay of mechanical, biomechanical, and computational challenges, while simultaneously offering transformative opportunities through emerging technologies. A primary mechanical limitation lies in actuation systems, where high reflected inertia and impedance restrict natural movement and fail to provide adequate support during dynamic tasks [9]. These constraints are exacerbated by the coupling of actuator and contact forces, which complicates control computations [10], and the oversimplification of anatomical variations that limits dexterity [11]. The inability to accurately represent interand intra-joint dependencies further restricts motion range [12], while the computational burden of existing methods forces trade-offs between accuracy and speed [13].\n\nUser adaptability remains a critical challenge, particularly in addressing the diverse rehabilitation needs of stroke patients. Existing methods often fail to provide real-time, customized assistance that aligns with varying medical conditions [4]. The complexity of bimanual manipulation, with its large state and action spaces and the need for spatial and temporal synchronization, further highlights the challenges in achieving natural user interaction [2]. Residual vibrations in exoskeletons complicate user experience and satisfaction, underscoring the need for improved dynamic stability [5]. Additionally, the lack of intuitive and standardized methods for describing human movements in machine learning applications hinders effective communication among biomechanics experts [14].\n\nBiomechanical modeling presents significant hurdles, with traditional approaches struggling to capture human dynamics comprehensively. Current musculoskeletal simulators often neglect muscle inertia effects [15], and the assumption of mechanical energy conservation fails during high-intensity movements [3]. The inability to model interactions between active and passive joints under varying external conditions further limits predictive accuracy [7]. Joint axis estimation methods face inaccuracies under varying motion speeds [16], and existing benchmarks often lack the complexity required for effective muscle-actuated control [17].\n\nEmerging opportunities address these limitations through innovative approaches. Differentiable simulation methods offer potential solutions for improving biomechanical accuracy [15], while artificial intelligence enables more precise prediction of user intentions [18]. Advanced computational methods enhance parameter estimation efficiency [19], and novel materials may resolve current structural limitations. The development of accessible programming frameworks for biomechanical simulations could democratize research [20], while insights from molecular motor mechanochemistry may inform new design principles [21]. These advancements collectively point toward a new generation of exoskeletons capable of addressing diverse rehabilitation needs through sophisticated biomechanical integration and adaptive control.\n\nThe exploration of challenges and opportunities in exoskeleton design underscores the importance of continued innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration. By addressing the mechanical and computational hurdles, researchers can enhance the functionality and adaptability of these devices, ultimately improving rehabilitation outcomes for a wide range of patients.
