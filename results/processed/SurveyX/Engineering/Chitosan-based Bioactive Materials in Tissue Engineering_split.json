However, the brittle behavior of chitosan hydrogels under dynamic swelling conditions requires further characterization [23].\n\nChitosan’s antimicrobial activity arises from its polycationic structure, disrupting microbial cell membranes through electrostatic interactions and chelation of essential metal ions [23]. This property is advantageous in wound healing, where chitosan-based scaffolds reduce infection risks while promoting tissue repair [5]. Hierarchical 3D scaffolds incorporating chitosan demonstrate efficacy in multidrug delivery, combining antimicrobial action with controlled release kinetics [9]. The integration of conductive pathways within chitosan composites enhances functionality, as seen in polyhydroxyalkanoate-based biocomposites [4].\n\nChitosan’s antioxidative potential, when combined with cerium oxide nanoparticles, mitigates oxidative stress in engineered tissues, preserving cellular viability [6].

A significant challenge is their mechanical brittleness and limited load-bearing capacity, which necessitates precise optimization of molecular weight and crosslinking to meet diverse tissue requirements [2]. Similar to challenges in porous PLA systems, controlling mechanical properties through processing parameters remains complex [30]. Unlike titanium alloys that offer hardness but have machinability issues [31], chitosan’s mechanical attributes require careful tuning.\n\nBatch-to-batch variability, due to inconsistencies in raw material sources and extraction methods, results in unpredictable degradation kinetics and biological responses [16]. This variability complicates scaffold reproducibility and clinical outcomes [4]. Surface activation techniques, while initially effective, often lack long-term stability, affecting cellular interactions [23].\n\nScalability in production is another hurdle, particularly for techniques like electrospinning and 3D printing, which face challenges in maintaining precision and reproducibility [36]. The Porous-Fisher model’s assumptions about cell behavior also limit predictive accuracy [1].
