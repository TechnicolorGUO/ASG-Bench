      "content": "The integration of block-based coding in K-12 education offers transformative potential for nurturing computational thinking and interdisciplinary learning. This survey has explored the diverse applications of block-based platforms, illustrating their efficacy in simplifying programming concepts and fostering equitable participation in computer science. By abstracting complex syntax, platforms like Scratch enable students to focus on algorithmic logic and problem-solving, thereby deepening their understanding of computational principles. The synergy of these coding environments with STEM disciplines, particularly through educational robotics and physical computing, enhances spatial reasoning and systems thinking while maintaining student engagement.\n\nThe findings underscore the capability of block-based coding to accommodate diverse learning styles, mitigating early gender disparities in computer science. By validating various forms of computational creativity, these platforms create inclusive environments that encourage broad student participation. Advanced tools like DSAScratch demonstrate the versatility of visual programming in conveying complex topics, such as data structures and algorithms, challenging preconceived limitations of block-based systems. Despite these benefits, challenges persist in scalability, teacher readiness, and curriculum integration, highlighting the need for innovative pedagogical and assessment strategies to fully exploit the potential of block-based coding in education.\n\nFuture research should emphasize longitudinal studies to assess the retention of computational thinking skills across educational stages, providing insights into long-term skill application. Investigating optimal scaffolding for diverse learners will enhance the effectiveness of block-based curricula. The development of adaptive technologies, including AI-driven feedback and grading systems, promises to personalize learning and overcome resource constraints. Expanding culturally responsive teaching and designing inclusive platforms will be crucial for equitable access to computational education. As block-based coding evolves, its integration with emerging technologies and interdisciplinary curricula will solidify its role as a vital tool for equipping students with essential skills for the digital era.",
