The survey begins with an introduction to the importance of fairness in recommender systems, establishing a critical framework for understanding the implications of biased algorithms. Following this introductory section, a detailed exploration of core concepts is presented in Section 2, which encompasses the foundations of recommender systems, key fairness notions, and the ethical implications associated with algorithmic decisions. This foundational knowledge is crucial for readers to appreciate the complexities of fairness in algorithmic contexts.\n\n[Image]\nFigure 1: chapter structure\n\nIn Section 3, the survey categorizes and analyzes various sources of bias, including data-driven, algorithmic, and systemic biases. Each type of bias presents unique challenges and requires tailored approaches for identification and mitigation. By dissecting these biases, the survey highlights the multifaceted nature of fairness issues in recommender systems, emphasizing that biases can arise from multiple sources, including the data used for training algorithms and the algorithms themselves. This analysis not only clarifies the origins of bias but also sets the stage for understanding the importance of developing effective mitigation strategies.\n\nSection 4 reviews fairness metrics and evaluation frameworks, distinguishing between consumerside and producer-side perspectives. This distinction is vital as it allows stakeholders to evaluate fairness from different vantage points, ensuring that both users and developers have a clear understanding of fairness implications. The metrics discussed provide a quantitative basis for assessing fairness outcomes, which is essential for guiding improvements in algorithmic design. Following this, Section 5 presents a taxonomy of bias mitigation techniques, including pre-processing, inprocessing, and post-processing methods, as well as emerging hybrid approaches. Each of these techniques plays a critical role in addressing identified biases, and their comparative effectiveness is explored to provide a nuanced understanding of how best to achieve fairness in practice.\n\nEthical and regulatory considerations are discussed in Section 6, highlighting global guidelines and stakeholder responsibilities. This section underscores the necessity for ethical frameworks that govern the development and deployment of recommender systems. As algorithms operate within societal contexts, the ethical implications of their use must be carefully considered to foster trust and accountability among users. Finally, Section 7 identifies open challenges, such as trade-offs between fairness and performance, and proposes future research directions, including dynamic fairness and interdisciplinary collaboration. This forward-looking perspective not only identifies gaps in the current research but also encourages ongoing dialogue among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to address the evolving landscape of algorithmic fairness. This structured approach ensures a comprehensive and coherent narrative that guides readers through the multifaceted landscape of algorithmic fairness in recommender systems.The following sections are organized as shown in Figure 1.",

      "content": "Recommender systems are critical predictive algorithms that drive personalized suggestions across platforms such as e-commerce and social media, employing methodologies like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches [1]. These techniques rely on modeling user preferences accurately but face challenges due to diverse user behaviors, similar to issues in stance detection where multiple valid interpretations coexist [2, 3]. The field of algorithmic fairness has evolved from prioritizing accuracy to incorporating diversity, serendipity, and equitable outcomes, with fairness notions classified into group, individual, and hybrid categories [4, 5]. These approaches vary between static constraints and dynamic mechanisms responsive to contextual changes in user interactions [6].\n\nFairness evaluation distinguishes consumer-side fairness, focusing on users, from producer-side fairness, emphasizing content visibility [7]. Advancements consider intersectional two-sided fairness, addressing both user and item dimensions [8, 9]. Two-sided marketplaces often suffer from biases due to disproportionate exposure of active users and popular items, impacting recommendation integrity [10]. Balancing accuracy with diversity metrics while considering stakeholder interests requires addressing trade-offs between system performance and fairness for minority groups, as seen in music recommendation systems [11, 12, 13, 14].\n\nEmerging research underscores the importance of both user and item fairness in two-sided markets [15]. The complex trade-offs between these dimensions necessitate approaches that maintain recommendation quality and relevance [16]. Current frameworks address transparency, cognitive models, privacy-aware approaches, and mechanisms targeting popularity bias to ensure equitable representation [17]. Future research must develop adaptive fairness metrics that respond to user contexts and societal values while tackling the interplay between privacy and fairness in recommendation scenarios.",

Ethical challenges include engagement with adverse impacts, implementation guidelines, and tension between quality and fairness objectives, with healthcare systems exemplifying these dilemmas [24, 13].\n\nThe societal impact of biased recommendations perpetuates inequality, with content producers facing visibility barriers and consumers limited by non-diverse suggestions [25]. Addressing algorithmic bias is essential for equitable outcomes, requiring responsible AI research that considers societal implications and ethical responsibilities [26]. Implementing adaptive frameworks that integrate diverse ethical principles like transparency, justice, and fairness, alongside practical deployment considerations, is crucial for aligning AI practices with societal expectations and ensuring algorithmic accountability [20, 19].

This section delineates four core bias categories: data-driven, algorithmic, user interaction, and systemic biases, each profoundly impacting recommendation algorithms. Understanding these biases illuminates complexities in ensuring equitable recommendations. As illustrated in Figure 2, this figure organizes the sources and types of biases within recommender systems into distinct categories, detailing the specific impacts and solutions relevant to each type. It highlights the complexities related to fairness and discrimination challenges, illustrating the relationships between data-driven, algorithmic, user interaction, and systemic biases. Data-driven biases arise from training datasets, where inherent disparities influence algorithmic fairness, significantly affecting diverse user groups [27]. The latency-fairness trade-off illustrates this challenge, as optimizing user fairness and average delay remains problematic [28].\n\n[Image]\nFigure 2: This figure organizes the sources and types of biases within recommender systems into distinct categories, detailing the specific impacts and solutions relevant to each type.

      "content": "Data-driven biases in recommender systems emerge from distortions within training datasets, crucially shaping algorithmic fairness. These biases manifest through minority group underrepresentation, skewed interaction patterns, and systemic disparities in data collection. The dataset composition influences model behavior, often perpetuating discriminatory outcomes, particularly affecting non-mainstream users [27]. This is intensified by latency-fairness trade-offs, where user fairness and delay optimization remain challenging [28].\n\nThree primary categories of data-driven biases dominate research: sampling biases, measurement biases, and historical biases. Sampling biases result from disproportionate representation, skewing training data toward mainstream preferences. Measurement biases stem from systematic errors in data collection, distorting user preferences. Historical biases reflect societal inequalities embedded in observational data, entrenching discriminatory practices in algorithmic outputs. Minority providers suffer from sampling biases, creating feedback loops that marginalize them by imbalanced exposure [29].\n\nThe relationship between user activity levels and recommendation quality highlights another dimension of data-driven bias. Active users significantly influence model training, leading to fairness gaps where they receive more accurate recommendations. Inconsistencies in user ratings further exacerbate this, disadvantaging specific groups through miscalibrated recommendations [30]. Protected attributes like gender and age can lead to systematic discrimination in outputs [31].\n\nAddressing these biases involves reconciling fairness objectives. User fairness often conflicts with organizational fairness, aiming for balanced content [12]. Low public understanding of fairness metrics complicates decision-making about trade-offs [13]. Algorithms prioritize one dimensionuser fairness, item fairness, or diversityneglecting others and causing inequitable outcomes [18]. Balancing engagement and exposure remains challenging [16].\n\nIntersectional analysis reveals compounding effects from interacting bias dimensions, with singlesided fairness methods failing to address this complexity. Historical injustices encoded in AI systems from training data underscore causal pathway analysis necessity [25, 32]. Emerging research advocates for adaptive sampling techniques and synthetic data generation to address representation gaps, preserving data utility. Standardized bias assessment protocols must include statistical and qualitative evaluations, addressing fundamental metric misapplication that leads to flawed conclusions [33]. Causal inference frameworks promise robust fairness interventions at the data level, accounting for biases’ compositional nature in complex pipelines.",

Biases arise from preferential item treatment, disparity amplification, and systematic user discrimination. Post-processing algorithms can inadvertently introduce discrimination by altering ranking distributions, illustrating the complex balance between interventions and fairness outcomes [15].\n\nResearch identifies three primary algorithmic bias categories: popularity, feedback loop, and representation biases. Algorithms favor popular items, reinforcing cycles of visibility that marginalize lesser-known items. Feedback loop biases optimize recommendations based on past interactions, perpetuating inequalities and limiting diverse exposure. Representation biases result from models inadequately reflecting varied user preferences, failing to cater broadly and marginalizing underrepresented groups. These biases affect satisfaction, decision-making, and fairness in AI systems [34, 29, 5, 6].\n\nTo further elucidate these concepts, Figure 3 illustrates the main algorithmic biases, challenges in achieving fairness, and directions for future research in fairness-aware recommendation systems. This visual representation emphasizes the intricate relationships among the identified biases and the ongoing challenges in the field.\n\nOperationalizing fairness constraints involves trade-offs between competing objectives. Fairnessaware algorithms requiring protected attributes raise privacy concerns, introducing discrimination via bias mitigation processes. Balancing individual and group fairness metrics complicates algorithm design. Neural recommendation models’ distributed representations exacerbate bias isolation challenges; mainstream bias leads to suboptimal recommendations, with cost-sensitive learning methods often ineffective [9, 27, 1, 35].\n\nEmerging research advocates for model-agnostic fairness interventions applicable across paradigms while preserving recommendation systems’ core functions. Future work must tackle scalability challenges of fairness-aware algorithms in industrial-scale systems, where constraints limit complex bias mitigation feasibility. Adaptive fairness mechanisms show promise, dynamically responding to behavior and societal norm shifts, addressing evolving algorithmic biases’ impact on individual and societal decision-making. Interdisciplinary research explores fairness’s normative claims within various contexts [36, 5, 37, 6].\n\n[Image]\nFigure 3: This figure illustrates main algorithmic biases, challenges in achieving fairness, and directions for future research in fairness-aware recommendation systems.",

Biases arise from self-selection effects, strategic provider behavior, and platform design decisions privileging particular interactions. Feedback loops amplify initial user interaction biases through iterative model updates [15], creating cycles where certain content gains visibility while others remain underrepresented.\n\nThree interaction bias categories dominate research: activity, conformity, and presentation biases. Activity bias occurs when active users disproportionately influence outcomes, creating gaps where they receive more accurate recommendations. Conformity bias arises from users engaging with mainstream content, homogenizing recommendations. Presentation bias results from design choices affecting user selection, independent of preferences [18].\n\nStakeholder biases reflect competing interests among platform operators, providers, and users, creating complex trade-offs. Operators balance engagement metrics with equitable outcomes, prioritizing business goals reinforcing existing biases. Providers can manipulate algorithms, creating false popularity signals distorting quality. Such dynamics create trade-off spaces where optimizing one stakeholder’s interests often impedes others [16].\n\nUser demographics’ interaction with recommendation quality reveals substantial bias dimensions. Demographic groups can differ in interaction patterns due to cultural, access, or historical factors, leading to differential algorithm treatment. This challenge intensifies with intersectional identities, where multiple characteristics create compounded biases beyond single-axis fairness approaches [8].\n\nEmerging research focuses on interaction-aware metrics addressing diverse group behaviors, ensuring recommendation quality. This involves methodologies adapting to unique group behaviors and preferences, mitigating algorithm biases, promoting equitable outcomes in information dissemination [38, 7, 37, 8, 6]. Future work must address designing interfaces mitigating presentation bias without compromising user experience, and stakeholder-aware optimization frameworks balancing interests transparently.

Institutional biases embed in platform policies favoring certain interactions or content types. Cultural biases reflect societal norms, amplifying mainstream preferences over minority ones. Historical biases encode discrimination patterns through generations, creating feedback loops perpetuating inequality. These dimensions interact multiplicatively, causing compounded disadvantages that single-axis fairness approaches overlook.\n\nOperationalizing intersectional fairness faces unique challenges, requiring multiple attribute consideration and interaction analysis. Current metrics focusing on single dimensions neglect intersecting identity complexities. This limitation is evident in recommendation scenarios with compounded gender, race, and socioeconomic disadvantages. Algorithmic auditing lacks granularity to detect intersectional discrimination and frameworks for societal implication interpretation.\n\nResearch focuses on developing intersectional metrics accounting for multiplicative effects of demographic interactions.

Research categorizes these notions by stakeholder group (consumer-side vs. producer-side), temporal dynamics (static vs. adaptive), and granularity (individual vs. group fairness). Consumer-side fairness ensures recommendations align with user preferences without discrimination, while producer-side fairness ensures content providers receive fair exposure [12]. This dichotomy highlights tensions between user-centric and provider-centric perspectives, particularly in music recommendation systems where algorithms like Most-pop exhibit high bias towards mainstream artists [14].\n\nStatic fairness applies fixed constraints, while dynamic mechanisms adapt to contextual changes. Static frameworks use predefined thresholds, whereas dynamic approaches adjust to user behaviors and system states. The model by [16] characterizes multi-sided fair recommendations, balancing user and item fairness. Dynamic models accommodate real-world complexities by recognizing user interaction fluidity.\n\nIndividual fairness ensures similar users receive comparable recommendations, while group fairness ensures equitable outcomes across demographics. User rating inconsistencies affect individual fairness, impacting recommendation quality [30]. Addressing these challenges requires understanding fairness across different analysis levels. Emerging notions emphasize ethical axioms, integrating individual agency and compliance in decision-making, recognizing that technical definitions often overlook power asymmetries [12].\n\nThis discussion is further illustrated in Figure 4, which presents a comprehensive taxonomy of fairness notions in recommendation systems. The figure categorizes these notions by stakeholder groups, temporal dynamics, and granularity, while also highlighting key studies that address these dimensions.

Consumer-side fairness metrics, such as Disparate Impact and Accuracy Difference, assess bias across demographics [41]. Disparate Impact evaluates outcome ratios between protected and unprotected groups, while Accuracy Difference measures prediction accuracy gaps. Balanced Accuracy considers true positive and negative rates, offering nuanced performance assessments [42]. Careful metric selection fosters user trust and ensures fair system operation.\n\nProducer-side metrics address visibility and exposure equity, crucial in two-sided marketplaces where algorithmic decisions affect economic opportunities. Metrics like Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) fairness and Average Recommendation Popularity (ARP) quantify recommendation slot distribution across items or creators. Analysis shows systematic biases in platform visibility, with certain content categories receiving disproportionate exposure. Causal disparity analysis reveals sensitive attributes, like race, influencing outcomes, highlighting the need for nuanced understanding of exposure dynamics [29, 32]. Balancing consumer and producer fairness requires trade-off analysis frameworks modeling these interdependencies.\n\nOperationalizing these metrics involves context-specific considerations, including recommendation domain nature and stakeholder concerns’ relative importance. Metrics must account for individual fairness (comparable recommendations for similar users) and group fairness (preventing disadvantage for protected classes).
