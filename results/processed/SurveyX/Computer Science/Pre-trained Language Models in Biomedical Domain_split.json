Annotated record scarcity hampers neural network training, while medical documentation’s informal and inconsistent nature challenges traditional NLP algorithms [43].\n\nBioNER tasks face hurdles due to non-canonical entity forms, orthographic errors, and limited annotation labels. Diagnostic label prediction methods neglect hierarchical structures and medical code co-occurrences, resulting in incomplete predictions [44]. Furthermore, large datasets required to effectively learn temporal dependencies are often infeasible in clinical settings [45]. Current methods inadequately incorporate temporal relationships and visit intervals crucial for accurate predictions [46]. Supervised methods struggle with clinical data complexity, leading to limited recall and generalization [47].\n\nThe lack of comprehensive systems integrating data sources for precise diagnosis and treatment impairs healthcare efficiency [37]. Existing English-centric benchmarks lack the annotations needed for effective NLP applications in other languages [48]. The burgeoning biomedical literature complicates topic annotation due to lexicon and terminology variability, with standardized benchmarks for model evaluation insufficient [49]. Current models fail to optimally utilize unstructured clinical text alongside structured medical data, limiting prediction accuracy in healthcare [50].\n\nAdaptive frameworks are crucial for managing noise and contextual complexity in biomedical data, with scalability and interoperability enhancing large-scale dataset processing. Frontier large language models (LLMs) face challenges with dataset-specific nuances and strict annotation guidelines, revealing performance limitations in discriminative tasks. Algorithms like FastContext showcase scalable implementations for clinical NLP, improving speed and accuracy. The modularity of shared EHR foundation models enables better prediction accuracy while reducing training data needs [51, 52, 53].
