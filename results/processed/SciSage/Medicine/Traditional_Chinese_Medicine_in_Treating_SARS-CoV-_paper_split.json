      "content": "The mechanisms by which Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) exerts therapeutic effects in SARS-CoV-2 infection remain an area of active investigation, with growing interest in integrating TCM with modern biomedical approaches. While clinical trials have demonstrated potential benefits of specific TCM formulations, the underlying biological pathways and molecular targets are not yet fully elucidated. This gap highlights the need for more rigorous, mechanistic studies to bridge traditional knowledge with contemporary pharmacological understanding.\n\nSeveral TCM compounds have been proposed to modulate immune responses and reduce viral replication in SARS-CoV-2 infections. For instance, quercetin, a flavonoid found in various medicinal plants, exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may mitigate oxidative stress and cytokine storms associated with severe COVID-19 [6]. Similarly, luteolin has been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells and inhibit cell proliferation, suggesting potential antiviral activity through modulation of signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt and NF-κB [8]. However, these findings are primarily based on in vitro or animal studies, and their applicability to human SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be validated in clinical trials. The TCMSP database provides a systems pharmacology platform that maps interactions between herbal compounds, their molecular targets, and disease-related pathways, offering a valuable resource for identifying potential mechanisms [4]. Despite this, most clinical trials have focused on symptom relief rather than mechanistic exploration, leaving critical gaps in understanding how TCM interventions interact with viral pathogenesis.\n\nSeveral randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated TCM formulations for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, with mixed results. For example, ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule have been reported to improve clinical outcomes, including reduced fever duration and improved lung imaging, though their efficacy and safety require further confirmation through large-scale, multicenter trials [1]. The integration of TCM into clinical practice is also hindered by methodological limitations, such as small sample sizes, lack of blinding, and inconsistent outcome measures. Additionally, the complexity of TCM formulations—often comprising multiple herbs with synergistic or antagonistic effects—complicates the identification of active components and their modes of action. These challenges underscore the importance of adopting standardized protocols and advanced analytical techniques, such as network pharmacology and metabolomics, to dissect the multifaceted mechanisms of TCM interventions [5].\n\nTo advance the scientific validation of TCM in SARS-CoV-2 treatment, future research should prioritize three key areas: (1) mechanistic studies using high-throughput omics technologies to identify molecular targets and signaling pathways affected by TCM compounds; (2) well-designed RCTs with robust endpoints and long-term follow-up to assess both efficacy and safety; and (3) the development of integrative frameworks that combine TCM knowledge with modern biomedical data. Furthermore, given the role of gut microbiota in immune regulation and disease progression, investigating how TCM formulations modulate the microbiome could provide novel insights into their therapeutic mechanisms [7]. By addressing these research gaps, the scientific community can move toward a more comprehensive understanding of TCM's potential in combating SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases.",

      "content": "The efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in treating SARS-CoV-2 has been a subject of increasing biomedical research, with studies exploring both its potential therapeutic mechanisms and clinical applications. TCM is characterized by its holistic approach, often involving multi-component formulations that target multiple biological pathways, which aligns with the complex nature of viral infections like SARS-CoV-2 [2]. For instance, herbal compounds such as ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule have been proposed as potential treatments, though their efficacy and safety require further confirmation through clinical trials [1]. The integration of systems pharmacology databases like TCMSP has facilitated the identification of bioactive compounds, their molecular targets, and disease associations, providing a framework for understanding how TCM may exert its effects at the molecular level [3]. These platforms enable researchers to analyze \"compound-protein/gene-disease\" networks, offering insights into the polypharmacological mechanisms underlying TCM interventions [4].\n\nFrom a biomedical research perspective, the application of network pharmacology has emerged as a critical tool for evaluating TCM's role in SARS-CoV-2 treatment. This approach shifts the paradigm from \"one-target, one-drug\" to \"network-target, multiple-component therapeutics,\" allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of how TCM formulations interact with biological systems [4]. Studies have demonstrated that TCM compounds can modulate key pathways involved in viral replication, immune response, and inflammation. For example, quercetin and luteolin, two flavonoids found in various medicinal herbs, exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties that may help mitigate the pathophysiological effects of SARS-CoV-2 [6][8]. Additionally, the modulation of gut microbiota by TCM components, such as Ganoderma lucidum, has been shown to reduce obesity-related inflammation and metabolic dysbiosis, suggesting potential indirect benefits in managing comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 [7]. However, while these findings are promising, they often rely on in vitro or animal models, and human clinical trials are needed to validate their translational potential.\n\nDespite growing interest in TCM for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, several challenges remain in its biomedical evaluation. One major limitation is the lack of standardized methodologies for assessing the efficacy of multi-component herbal formulations, which complicates direct comparisons with conventional drugs [2]. Furthermore, the complexity of TCM's mechanisms, including synergistic interactions among its constituents, poses difficulties for mechanistic studies using traditional reductionist approaches [4]. Another critical issue is the need for rigorous clinical trials to establish evidence-based guidelines for TCM use in SARS-CoV-2 management. While some observational studies have reported positive outcomes, such as improved symptom relief and reduced hospitalization rates, these results must be interpreted cautiously due to methodological limitations and potential biases [10]. Future research should prioritize large-scale, randomized controlled trials with robust outcome measures, as well as the development of advanced computational models to predict TCM-drug interactions and optimize formulation design. Integrating TCM with modern biotechnology, such as cryo-electron microscopy for structural analysis of viral proteins or systems biology for pathway modeling, could further enhance our understanding of its therapeutic potential [9][16]. Ultimately, a multidisciplinary approach combining traditional knowledge with cutting-edge biomedical techniques will be essential to fully realize the value of TCM in combating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging infectious diseases.",

TCM approaches have been explored both as standalone interventions and as complementary therapies to conventional treatments, with a particular emphasis on herbal formulations and their bioactive compounds. For instance, studies have highlighted the potential of compounds such as quercetin, luteolin, and abidol, which exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties that may mitigate the pathophysiological effects of SARS-CoV-2 [3][7]. These compounds are often derived from medicinal plants traditionally used in TCM for treating respiratory and inflammatory conditions, suggesting a plausible mechanistic basis for their application in viral infections.\n\nThe development of systems pharmacology databases, such as TCMSP, has further advanced the scientific evaluation of TCM by enabling the identification of bioactive compounds, their molecular targets, and potential therapeutic mechanisms [11]. Such platforms facilitate the systematic analysis of complex herbal formulations, which often contain multiple active ingredients that interact synergistically. This approach aligns with the network pharmacology paradigm, where the \"compound-protein/gene-disease\" interactions are analyzed to uncover the multi-target and multi-pathway effects of TCM preparations [2].
