      "level": 3,
      "content": "The PRISMA-DTA extension for diagnostic test accuracy studies has been instrumental in enhancing the transparency and completeness of reporting in systematic reviews. However, despite its structured approach, several limitations persist in the application and adherence to these guidelines, particularly in the areas of methodological rigor, consistency, and the integration of emerging methodologies.\n\nMethodological Limitations in Reporting\nWhile PRISMA-DTA provides a comprehensive 27-item checklist, its implementation often lacks consistency across studies. The extension was developed to improve the quality of systematic reviews by ensuring that key elements such as study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment are transparently reported. However, empirical evaluations have shown that many reviews still fail to adhere to all items, leading to incomplete or ambiguous descriptions of methods. For instance, while the checklist emphasizes the importance of describing the search strategy, many studies do not provide sufficient detail on the databases searched, time frames, or language restrictions, which can compromise the reproducibility of the review. Additionally, the guideline does not explicitly address the challenges of incorporating non-English studies, which may lead to publication bias and underrepresentation of certain populations.\n\nInadequate Integration of Emerging Methodologies\nAnother limitation lies in the limited guidance provided for integrating novel methodologies such as machine learning or artificial intelligence into diagnostic test accuracy studies. While PRISMA-DTA focuses on traditional diagnostic accuracy metrics like sensitivity and specificity, it does not offer clear frameworks for evaluating models that rely on complex algorithms or real-world data. This gap is particularly relevant in fields such as medical imaging and digital diagnostics, where AI-based tools are increasingly being evaluated. Without specific guidance on how to report algorithmic performance, model validation, and generalizability, reviewers may struggle to assess the reliability and applicability of these technologies in clinical settings.\n\nChallenges in Ensuring Transparency Across Domains\nDespite its intention to enhance transparency, PRISMA-DTA faces challenges in maintaining uniformity across diverse diagnostic domains. For example, in oncology, where molecular markers and histopathological assessments play a critical role, the checklist may not adequately capture the nuances of these methodologies. Similarly, in neurological conditions such as cerebral aneurysms, the integration of imaging modalities like CT, MRI, and DSA requires detailed reporting of technical specifications and interpretation criteria, which are not always fully addressed in PRISMA-DTA-compliant reports. These inconsistencies can hinder the comparability of results and limit the utility of systematic reviews in informing clinical practice.",

      "content": "The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA) represents a critical advancement in the standardization and transparency of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) research. Initially developed as an extension of the original PRISMA statement, which focused on systematic reviews of interventions, PRISMA-DTA was specifically tailored to address the unique methodological challenges inherent in DTA studies. This evolution was driven by the recognition that diagnostic accuracy assessments require distinct reporting standards due to their emphasis on test performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios, which are not central to intervention-based reviews. The PRISMA-DTA checklist comprises 27 items, eight of which are directly adapted from the original PRISMA guidelines, while the remaining 19 have been modified or newly introduced to reflect the specific needs of DTA research. These modifications ensure that key aspects of study design, data synthesis, and interpretation are systematically addressed, thereby enhancing the reliability and generalizability of findings.\n\nA significant milestone in the development of PRISMA-DTA was its integration with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy, which provided a structured framework for conducting and reporting DTA reviews. This alignment facilitated the adoption of PRISMA-DTA across diverse research domains, including radiology, infectious diseases, and oncology, where accurate diagnostic tools are essential for clinical decision-making. Furthermore, the introduction of PRISMA-DTA for Abstracts extended its utility to concise summaries, ensuring that key methodological details and results were accessible to a broader audience, including clinicians and policymakers. This expansion underscores the growing importance of transparent reporting in diagnostic research, particularly as the volume and complexity of DTA studies continue to increase. By promoting consistency in reporting, PRISMA-DTA has significantly improved the quality of systematic reviews, enabling more rigorous comparisons of diagnostic tests and supporting evidence-based healthcare practices.\n\nDespite its widespread adoption, PRISMA-DTA remains a dynamic framework that continues to evolve in response to emerging methodological challenges. For instance, the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnostic applications has highlighted the need for updated guidelines to address issues such as algorithm validation, bias mitigation, and generalizability [2]. Additionally, the integration of patient-reported outcomes and real-world data into DTA studies presents new opportunities and challenges for reporting standards. Future refinements to PRISMA-DTA should focus on incorporating these elements while maintaining the core principles of transparency and rigor. Moreover, there is a need for greater harmonization between PRISMA-DTA and other reporting guidelines, such as the STARD (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy) statement, to ensure coherence across different stages of diagnostic research [3][4]. As diagnostic technologies advance and healthcare systems become increasingly data-driven, the continued evolution of PRISMA-DTA will be essential to maintaining the integrity and impact of diagnostic test accuracy research.",

Initially developed as an extension of the PRISMA statement, PRISMA-DTA provides a structured framework to enhance the completeness and clarity of DTA study reports, ensuring that key methodological elements are consistently documented. This standardized approach has been widely adopted in various medical disciplines, including oncology, infectious diseases, and imaging modalities, demonstrating its broad applicability and utility in improving the quality of evidence synthesis. The extension includes 27 items, with eight adapted from the original PRISMA statement, while 19 are newly modified or elaborated to address specific challenges in DTA research. These modifications reflect a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in evaluating diagnostic tests, such as patient selection, index test characteristics, reference standard procedures, and flow of participants through the review process.\n\nDespite its widespread adoption, the implementation of PRISMA-DTA remains uneven across different fields and regions, highlighting persistent challenges in adhering to reporting guidelines. While some studies have demonstrated high compliance with PRISMA-DTA items, others exhibit suboptimal reporting, particularly in areas such as risk of bias assessment and statistical methods. For instance, the QUADAS-2 tool, which is often used in conjunction with PRISMA-DTA, has been critiqued for its reliance on subjective judgments and lack of explicit criteria for assessing bias [2][3]. This highlights the need for more objective and standardized tools to evaluate the quality of DTA studies, complementing the reporting guidelines provided by PRISMA-DTA. Furthermore, the application of PRISMA-DTA in non-English language journals and low-resource settings remains underexplored, suggesting a gap in global equity in the dissemination and implementation of these reporting standards.",

PRISMA-DTA is specifically tailored for DTA systematic reviews, ensuring that key methodological and reporting elements are consistently addressed [3]. The extension has undergone iterative refinement, including the development of PRISMA-DTA for Abstracts, a 12-item checklist for abstract-level reporting, and guidance on using risk-of-bias tools such as QUADAS-2 [5]. These updates improve the applicability of PRISMA-DTA across various stages of research, from planning to dissemination.\n\nA significant advancement in the PRISMA-DTA framework is its integration with other methodological guidelines, such as QUADAS-2 for quality assessment and SEDATE for head-to-head comparisons of diagnostic accuracy tests [4]. This combination enables more rigorous evaluations of diagnostic tests by addressing both study design and interpretation. For example, SEDATE provides specific recommendations for meta-analyses comparing multiple diagnostic modalities within the same population, an important consideration in fields like imaging where different techniques are often used interchangeably [4]. Additionally, PRISMA-DTA has been adapted to include emerging methodologies, such as decision curve analysis, which assesses the clinical utility of predictive models beyond traditional accuracy measures [12]. These integrations reflect an evolving approach to diagnostic evaluation, emphasizing both statistical performance and clinical relevance.\n\nChallenges persist in the consistent application of PRISMA-DTA, especially in heterogeneous fields where diagnostic tests differ significantly in design and context. The current framework may not fully account for non-randomized studies, which are common in real-world diagnostic settings [17]. While PRISMA-DTA offers a structured approach to reporting, it does not ensure the quality of the underlying studies, underscoring the need for complementary tools like QUADAS-2 to evaluate bias and applicability [14]. Future developments should aim to enhance the adaptability of PRISMA-DTA to diverse study designs, including those involving artificial intelligence and machine learning, which are increasingly used in diagnostic applications [13]. Incorporating these innovations will help maintain PRISMA-DTA as a leading standard for transparent and methodologically sound reporting of DTA studies.",
