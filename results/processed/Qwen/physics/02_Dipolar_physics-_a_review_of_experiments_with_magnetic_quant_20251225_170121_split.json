      "content": "The exploration of quantum gases, particularly Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), has been a cornerstone of modern physics for over two decades. Initially driven by the pursuit of fundamental quantum phenomena at macroscopic scales, the field has evolved to incorporate increasingly complex interactions, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of many-body quantum systems. While early experiments focused on ultra-cold alkali atoms interacting via short-range, isotropic contact potentials, a significant frontier has opened with the advent of quantum gases composed of particles with intrinsic magnetic or electric dipole moments. These systems are governed by long-range, anisotropic forces that fundamentally alter their equilibrium properties and collective dynamics, giving rise to a rich tapestry of novel quantum phases and behaviors not seen in their non-dipolar counterparts. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the experimental landscape of magnetic quantum gases, focusing on the key milestones, current state-of-the-art techniques, and the emergent phenomena of quantum droplets and supersolids.\n\nThe central motivation for studying these systems stems from the unique nature of the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI). Unlike the instantaneous and spherically symmetric van der Waals potential between ground-state alkali atoms, the DDI decays as 1/r³ and depends explicitly on the relative orientation of the dipoles. In a gas of trapped atoms, this leads to a competition between the isotropic mean-field interaction, which is typically repulsive, and the highly anisotropic DDI. The strength of this competition can be tuned by adjusting the scattering length via Feshbach resonances, while its character is controlled by the trap geometry and the orientation of the dipoles. This tunability allows researchers to explore a vast parameter space, making dipolar quantum gases ideal platforms for investigating strongly correlated matter. The experimental realization of such gases has therefore become a primary goal, enabling direct tests of theoretical predictions and opening new avenues for quantum simulation and precision measurement.\n\nThe historical development of this field marks a clear progression towards greater complexity and control. The first breakthrough came in 2005 with the creation of the first dipolar BEC using bosonic chromium-52 (⁵²Cr) [[1,4]]. Chromium was chosen for its large magnetic moment of six Bohr magnetons (μB), ensuring strong DDI effects [[4]]. However, it was soon recognized that its relatively small mass limited the achievable ratio of DDI to contact interaction strength. This limitation spurred intense research into heavier elements with even larger magnetic moments. The early 2010s saw the successful production of BECs from the rare-earth elements dysprosium (Dy) and erbium (Er), which possess exceptionally large magnetic moments of approximately ten and seven μB, respectively [[3,4]]. Their significantly larger masses provide a much more favorable platform for observing exotic dipolar phenomena. More recently, the scope has expanded beyond single-species pure condensates to include fermionic and bosonic polar molecules like NaCs and KRb, which exhibit strong electric DDI but face challenges related to collisional losses [[4,9]]. This evolution reflects a deepening understanding of atomic structure and trapping technologies, enabling access to a wider range of quantum systems.\n\nThis review aims to systematically document the journey of experimental dipolar quantum gases, from foundational work to cutting-edge research. We will begin by establishing the key concepts and defining the physical parameters that govern these systems. Following this, we will trace the chronological milestones that led to the current state of the art. Subsequently, we will delve into the detailed experimental methods used to create and probe these gases, before examining the most prominent applications and case studies, including quantum droplets, supersolids, roton excitations, and quantized vortices. Finally, we will critically assess the field's current challenges and open problems, identify key research gaps, and outline promising future directions. Through this structured analysis, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of a vibrant and rapidly advancing field at the intersection of atomic, molecular, and optical physics.",

      "content": "To understand the behavior of magnetic quantum gases, it is essential to establish a set of key concepts and dimensionless parameters that characterize the interplay between different interaction energies within the system. The Hamiltonian for a system of N identical bosons with magnetic dipole moments consists of three primary terms: the kinetic energy, the external trapping potential, and the two-body interaction potential. The latter is the sum of a short-range contact interaction, characteristic of all neutral atoms, and the long-range, anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction (DDI). The form of the DDI potential is crucial, as it dictates the anisotropic nature of the interactions.\n\nThe interaction potential between two dipoles, $\\vec{\\mu}$, separated by a distance $r$ is given by:\n$V_{dd}(\\vec{r}) = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\mu^2}{4\\pi r^3} \\left(1 - 3\\cos^2\\theta\\right)$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, $\\mu$ is the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment, and $\\theta$ is the angle between the dipole moment and the vector connecting the two particles. This potential is purely repulsive when the dipoles are aligned parallel and antiparallel to the line joining them ($\\theta=0,\\pi$), and purely attractive when they are perpendicular ($\\theta=\\pi/2$). This anisotropy is the source of many of the unique phenomena observed in dipolar gases.\n\nIn experiments, the strength of these interactions is often expressed in terms of s-wave scattering length, $a_s$, which describes the short-range contact interaction, and the dipolar length, $a_{dd}$, which characterizes the strength of the DDI. The dipolar length is defined as:\n$a_{dd} = \\frac{\\mu_0 g_F \\mu_B \\mu}{4\\pi \\hbar^2 m}$\nwhere $g_F$ is the Landé g-factor, $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, $\\mu$ is the magnetic dipole moment, and $m$ is the atomic mass. The ratio $\\eta = a_{dd}/a_s$ serves as a critical dimensionless parameter governing the physics of the system. When $\\eta \\ll 1$, the contact interaction dominates, and the system behaves similarly to a conventional BEC. As $\\eta$ increases, the DDI becomes more significant. For pure DDI systems where $a_s=0$, the stability criterion requires $\\eta < \\eta_c \\approx 0.18$ for a spherical trap. For cigar-shaped traps, stable, purely dipolar gases can exist for larger values of $\\eta$ [[4]].\n\nThe table below summarizes the key parameters for several experimentally realized magnetic quantum gases, highlighting the wide range of magnetic moments and masses available to researchers.\n\n| Atomic Species | Isotope(s) | Magnetic Moment (μB) | Mass (u) | Dipolar Length (a₀) | Year of First BEC | Source(s) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Chromium | ⁵²Cr | 6 | 51.948 | ~15 | 2005 | [[3,4]] |\n| Dysprosium | ¹⁶⁴Dy, ¹⁶²Dy | 10 | 164 | ~130 | 2011 | [[3,4]] |\n| Erbium | ¹⁶⁶Er, ¹⁶⁴Er, ¹⁶²Dy | 7 | 166 | ~65-70 | 2012 | [[3,4]] |\n| Europium | ¹⁵¹Eu | 7 | 151 | Not Available | 2022 | [[4]] |\n| Sodium-Cesium | NaCs | Not Applicable | 165.9 | Strong Electric DDI | Not Applicable | [[9]] |\n\nThe trap geometry plays a dual role. It confines the atoms, determining the density profile and thus the average interaction strength, and it also projects the three-dimensional DDI onto an effective one-dimensional or two-dimensional interaction depending on the aspect ratio ($\\lambda = \\omega_z/\\omega_\\perp$) of the trap. Cigar-shaped traps ($\\lambda \\gg 1$) enhance instabilities, while pancake-shaped traps ($\\lambda \\ll 1$) can stabilize purely dipolar gases [[4]]. The ability to tune the trap aspect ratio is therefore a powerful experimental knob for controlling the system's properties.\n\nA pivotal concept in the study of dipolar gases is the excitation spectrum, which reveals how collective modes propagate through the medium. The DDI introduces anisotropy into this spectrum, leading to phenomena like roton softening. A roton is a minimum in the excitation spectrum at a finite momentum. In dipolar BECs, the interplay between the long-range attraction of the DDI and the short-range repulsion of the contact interaction can cause this roton minimum to approach zero energy. This \"softening\" of the roton mode is a critical precursor to dynamic instability and the formation of spatially modulated structures. The emergence of a roton mode has been directly observed in both erbium and dysprosium gases, providing crucial evidence for the underlying physics [[3,7]]. The study of these excitations is not only fundamental but also holds promise for applications in precision measurement, as the properties of the roton mode are sensitive to the microscopic details of the interactions [[1]].",

      "content": "The history of experimental physics with magnetic quantum gases is a story of remarkable progress, marked by key discoveries that have progressively unlocked new frontiers in the study of quantum matter. This journey began with overcoming the initial challenge of achieving quantum degeneracy in species with strong magnetic dipole moments, which often come with complications like large radiative decay rates and complex level structures. The path forward required advancements in laser cooling, magneto-optical trapping, and evaporative cooling techniques tailored to these specific atomic systems.\n\nThe foundational milestone was the achievement of the first dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate in 2005, realized with a gas of bosonic chromium-52 (⁵²Cr) atoms [[1,4]]. This groundbreaking work by Griesmaier et al. demonstrated that it was possible to cool and trap a species with a substantial magnetic moment (6 μB) to quantum degeneracy [[4]]. Around the same time, Stuhler et al. provided the first direct evidence of the impact of DDI on a degenerate gas, observing its influence on the condensate's properties [[1]]. This initial success laid the theoretical groundwork; earlier work by Santos, Shlyapnikov, Zoller, and Lewenstein, as well as Góral, Rza̧żewski, and Pfau, had already modeled the effects of DDI in trapped BECs, predicting phenomena like shape deformation and anisotropic collapse [[1]]. The Cr experiments were followed by demonstrations of strong dipolar effects in a quantum ferrofluid in 2007, showcasing the dramatic response of a dipolar gas to its own interactions [[1]].\n\nWhile the Cr experiments were seminal, the field's rapid advancement was propelled by the subsequent realization of BECs in the heavier, more technologically demanding rare-earth elements, dysprosium (Dy) and erbium (Er). The first Dy BEC was achieved in 2011 by Lu et al., and the first Er BEC followed in 2012 by Aikawa et al. [[3,4]]. These elements offered a significant advantage due to their larger magnetic moments (around 10 μB for Dy and 7 μB for Er) combined with much larger atomic masses compared to Cr [[4]]. This combination results in a much larger dipolar length ($a_{dd}$) relative to the scattering length ($a_s$), creating a more pronounced regime for exploring exotic dipolar physics. The development of efficient laser cooling schemes and high-power dye lasers for these species was a major technical hurdle that was ultimately overcome, opening the door to a new generation of experiments.\n\nPerhaps the most transformative development occurred in 2015 with the discovery of quantum stabilization, which enabled the observation of self-bound quantum droplets in dipolar BECs [[3]]. In a typical BEC, if the attractive mean-field interactions (dominated by negative scattering length or DDI) become too strong, the condensate collapses under its own attraction. However, it was theoretically predicted and then experimentally confirmed that for very dilute, highly dipolar gases, quantum fluctuations, specifically the Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction, can provide a repulsive pressure sufficient to counteract this collapse [[2,3]]. This effect was first observed in Dy and Er BECs where the mean-field interactions were tuned to nearly cancel each other out [[4]]. The resulting quantum droplets are fascinating objects: they are self-bound states of atoms held together by a delicate balance between mean-field attraction and the LHY-induced repulsion, forming a liquid-like drop of quantum matter without any external confinement [[3,8]]. This discovery shifted the focus of the field from merely observing the effects of DDI to actively engineering and manipulating new forms of quantum matter.\n\nThe next major leap was the observation of supersolidity in dipolar gases in 2019. A supersolid is a phase of matter that simultaneously exhibits the properties of a superfluid (frictionless flow) and a solid (long-range crystalline order). Using Dy and Er BECs, multiple groups independently reported the formation of supersolids [[3,4]]. This was achieved by tuning the system to a point where the roton mode in the excitation spectrum softened to zero energy, triggering a spontaneous breaking of the continuous translational symmetry of the superfluid background [[10,11]]. This resulted in the condensate developing a periodic density modulation, thereby acquiring a crystalline structure while retaining its superfluid properties [[4]]. The ability to observe and control this transition represented a monumental advance, providing a clean, ultracold laboratory setting to study one of the most bizarre and elusive phases of matter. These milestones—from the first dipolar BEC to the discovery of quantum droplets and supersolids—collectively illustrate a field that has matured from proving the existence of dipolar effects to becoming a premier platform for discovering and controlling entirely new states of quantum matter.",

      "content": "The experimental investigation of magnetic quantum gases relies on a sophisticated suite of techniques for producing, controlling, and probing these fragile systems. The core process begins with laser cooling and trapping of atoms, followed by a multi-stage evaporative cooling sequence to reach quantum degeneracy. However, for the heavy rare-earth elements like dysprosium and erbium, standard red-detuned optical dipole traps (ODTs) can lead to significant heating and loss due to their large polarizability and complex internal structures. Consequently, a major area of innovation has been the development of alternative trapping schemes.\n\nOne of the most significant recent advances is the development of blue-detuned optical potentials for dysprosium [[12]]. By using light with a wavelength longer than the atom's electronic resonance, these traps exert a repulsive force. Preti et al. successfully demonstrated a repulsive blue-detuned trap operating near 403–404 nm, which suppresses black-body radiation-induced spin flips and reduces trap-induced losses [[12]]. At a wavelength of 404 nm, they measured a maximum scalar polarizability of -13,000 atomic units, allowing for a trap depth of 500 nK with just 1 mW of laser power. This technique enables the creation of novel geometries, such as ring-shaped potentials, which are ideal for studying persistent currents and testing theories of superfluid-supersolid dynamics [[12]]. Other loss-suppression strategies include quasi-2D confinement, which was shown to reduce the dipolar relaxation rate in ¹⁶²Dy by an order of magnitude, paving the way for exploring 2D physics [[5]].\n\nPrecise control over the magnetic field is another critical element. The strength and especially the *orientation* of the dipoles relative to the trap axes are key parameters that can dramatically alter the system's behavior. To achieve this, highly stable and tunable magnetic fields are required. Advanced experimental setups utilize feedback systems and H-bridge circuits to provide fast and precise control over both the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field, allowing for fine-tuning of the dipolar interactions [[2]]. This capability is essential for exploring phenomena like roton softening, where the scattering length is quenched to a specific value, and for stabilizing certain phases against collapse [[4,7]].\n\nOnce the quantum gas is prepared, a variety of diagnostic tools are employed to extract information about its properties. Interferometry is a common technique, used to measure the phase of the condensate wavefunction and detect interference patterns that reveal coherence properties. Time-of-flight imaging, where the trap is switched off and the cloud is allowed to expand, provides a snapshot of the momentum distribution, from which the density and temperature can be inferred. For more detailed spectroscopic information, Bragg spectroscopy is a powerful tool. It involves using two intersecting laser beams to impart a known momentum kick to the atoms, exciting collective modes. This technique was instrumental in observing the roton excitation spectrum in elongated Er BECs by measuring the momentum distribution after an interaction quench [[3,7]].\n\nProbing the internal structure and dynamics of newly discovered phases like quantum droplets and supersolids requires more specialized methods. One such method is superradiant light scattering, where a probe laser is scattered coherently by the density modulations in the gas. This technique was used to investigate the coherence and expansion dynamics of the gas across the BEC-to-droplet transition, revealing nonmonotonic behavior in the superradiant efficiency [[2]]. To visualize the formation of density peaks in a supersolid, absorption imaging is used to directly capture images of the spatial modulation. For detecting quantized vortices, a technique called 'magnetostirring' is employed, where a rotating magnetic field is applied to stir the condensate. This induces dynamical instabilities that lead to the nucleation of vortices, which can then be imaged after the stirring ceases [[6]]. The combination of these advanced trapping, control, and diagnostic techniques represents the current state-of-the-art, enabling unprecedented exploration of the complex and rich physics of magnetic quantum gases.",

      "content": "The experimental exploration of magnetic quantum gases has yielded profound insights into the nature of quantum matter, leading to the discovery and characterization of several exotic phases of matter. These findings are not merely academic curiosities; they serve as powerful testbeds for fundamental theories of condensed matter physics and offer potential pathways toward novel quantum technologies. The primary applications and case studies in this field revolve around the manipulation and study of quantum droplets, supersolids, roton excitations, and quantized vortices.\n\n**Quantum Droplets:** Perhaps the most significant application arising from this field is the ability to create and study self-bound quantum droplets [[3,8]]. These droplets are stabilized against collapse not by an external trap, but by a delicate balance between mean-field attraction (from either a negative scattering length or the DDI) and the repulsive pressure from quantum fluctuations, specifically the Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction [[3,4]]. This phenomenon, first observed in 2015, represents the creation of a new form of quantum liquid [[3]]. Experiments have demonstrated the formation of single droplets and, more recently, arrays of droplets [[2,4]]. Theoretical models predict rich dynamics for these droplets, including quasi-elastic collisions at low velocities and completely inelastic merging at higher speeds [[8]]. Furthermore, stable vortex states are predicted to exist within these droplets, though they have not yet been observed experimentally [[13]]. The ability to tune the inter-particle interactions to achieve this quantum-stabilized regime opens up possibilities for exploring novel forms of superfluidity and quantum hydrodynamics.\n\n**Supersolids:** The observation of supersolids in 2019 marked a landmark achievement, bringing to life a state of matter that had been theorized for decades [[3,4]]. Supersolids spontaneously break both the U(1) gauge symmetry of the superfluid and the continuous translational symmetry of space, resulting in a system that flows without viscosity while maintaining a crystalline density modulation [[10]]. This was first demonstrated in dipolar BECs of ¹⁶⁶Er, ¹⁶⁴Dy, and ¹⁶²Dy, where the system was driven through a superfluid-to-supersolid phase transition via roton softening [[3,4]]. The resulting density waves were observed using absorption imaging, revealing structures such as stripes, zigzags, and hexagonal lattices [[3,4,6]]. These experiments provide a pristine environment to study the coexistence of superfluidity and crystallinity, a topic of immense interest in condensed matter physics. Numerical simulations confirm that these transitions are consistent with the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, offering a window into universal dynamics far from equilibrium [[11]].\n\n**Roton Excitations:** The roton mode, a minimum in the excitation spectrum at finite momentum, is a key feature of dipolar quantum gases and serves as a critical indicator of the system's stability [[3,7]]. Its softening, where the energy of the roton minimum approaches zero, is the precursor to the formation of supersolids and other modulated phases [[10]]. The direct observation of roton modes via interaction quenches and Bragg spectroscopy in both Er and Dy BECs has provided quantitative validation of theoretical predictions [[3,4,7]]. In elongated traps, the roton momentum was shown to scale with the inverse of the trap length along the polarization axis, confirming geometric scaling laws [[7]]. Studying the dynamics of the roton mode offers a pathway to precision measurements of the underlying dipole-dipole interaction and could potentially be used to simulate cosmological phenomena, such as the inflationary power spectrum, in an analogue gravity setup [[4]].\n\n**Quantized Vortices:** The study of quantized vortices in dipolar BECs provides a direct probe of superfluidity in the presence of anisotropic interactions [[6]]. In a classic superfluid, a vortex is a topological defect characterized by a circulation quantized in units of Planck's constant. In a dipolar gas, the anisotropic DDI modifies the vortex core structure and its energetics. The first experimental observation of vortices in a dipolar BEC was performed with ¹⁶²Dy, where they were nucleated using 'magnetostirring' [[6]]. The resulting vortex lattice arranged itself into a stripe pattern, aligned with the direction of the rotated magnetic field. This alignment is a direct consequence of the anisotropic energy landscape imposed by the DDI. Simulations including the LHY correction showed excellent agreement with the experimental data, underscoring the importance of beyond-mean-field effects even in describing vortex dynamics [[6]]. These experiments demonstrate that superfluidity persists even with dominant DDI, albeit with modified properties.\n\nThese case studies collectively highlight the immense potential of magnetic quantum gases as a versatile platform for quantum simulation. By precisely tuning the inter-particle interactions and confining geometry, researchers can engineer model Hamiltonians to explore a wide range of physical phenomena, from novel forms of superfluidity and crystallization to universal dynamics in quantum phase transitions.",

      "content": "Despite the remarkable progress in the field of magnetic quantum gases, several significant challenges and open questions remain. These issues span the entire experimental cycle, from the initial preparation of the quantum gas to the interpretation of the final results, and represent the frontiers of current research. Addressing these challenges is crucial for unlocking the full potential of these systems for fundamental science and future applications.\n\nOne of the most persistent challenges is the suppression of collisional losses, particularly in the highly magnetic dysprosium and erbium systems. Three-body recombination is a major loss mechanism that limits the lifetime of the condensate and sets a practical upper bound on the density that can be achieved [[3]]. While various techniques have been developed to mitigate this, such as using specific hyperfine states or applying radio-frequency dressing, finding a universally effective solution remains an active area of research. The problem is exacerbated in binary mixtures of different dipolar species, where sympathetic cooling is difficult due to gravitational sag caused by the mass difference between the components, hindering the formation of a uniform, miscible mixture [[14]].\n\nAnother major challenge lies in accessing and controlling the true two-dimensional (2D) regime. Many of the most interesting theoretical predictions, such as the formation of strictly 2D supersolids and the enhanced stability of certain vortex states, occur when the transverse confinement is so tight that thermal and quantum fluctuations are frozen out [[4]]. However, reaching the extreme densities required for roton softening in this regime has proven difficult in current experiments [[4]]. Quasi-2D confinement, where a stack of pancake-shaped layers ('crêpes') is used, is a workaround, but it introduces additional complexities, such as residual axial motion and inter-layer coupling, which may obscure some of the ideal 2D physics [[5]]. Achieving true 2D confinement would require either further cooling to extremely low temperatures or novel trapping techniques that can support the necessary high peak densities.\n\nThe precise characterization of quantum fluctuations and beyond-mean-field effects presents another layer of difficulty. While the Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction is now understood to be the key ingredient for stabilizing quantum droplets, its accurate description within the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation (eGPE) framework is still an area of refinement. The eGPE includes the LHY term phenomenologically, but its exact functional form and numerical prefactor can depend on the specific system and density. Validating these corrections against first-principles calculations, such as diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) simulations, is essential for building confidence in theoretical predictions [[9,14]]. Similarly, incorporating finite-temperature effects into theoretical models is crucial for comparing with experiments, as thermal fluctuations can play a significant role in the dynamics and stability of the system [[3]].\n\nFinally, there are fundamental open questions regarding the nature of the phases themselves. While supersolids have been observed, the precise mechanisms governing their formation, the nature of the phase transition (continuous vs. discontinuous), and the role of disorder and finite-temperature effects are not fully understood [[3]]. There are also open questions about the stability of predicted but unobserved states, such as vortex quantum droplets [[13]]. Furthermore, the possibility of realizing even more exotic structures, such as labyrinth or pumpkin phases, remains a tantalizing open problem that requires both theoretical guidance and experimental ingenuity to explore [[3]]. Overcoming these challenges will likely require a synergistic effort combining advances in trapping and cooling technology, refined theoretical modeling, and innovative experimental designs.",

Having established the foundational principles and explored a rich landscape of exotic quantum phases, future research is shifting towards deeper investigations of the fundamental physics, the pursuit of new and more complex states of matter, and the development of novel experimental capabilities. The trajectory of this field points towards greater control, higher precision, and the exploration of previously inaccessible regimes of quantum matter.\n\nA primary future direction is the definitive exploration of the two-dimensional (2D) regime. Realizing and characterizing 2D supersolids and vortex quantum droplets is a major outstanding goal [[4,13]]. This will likely require the development of new trapping technologies capable of achieving the ultracold temperatures and extreme densities needed to freeze out all transverse motion. Blue-detuned optical traps, as demonstrated for dysprosium, are a promising avenue for reducing heating and losses in 2D geometries [[12]]. The study of scale-invariance breaking in 2D strongly dipolar superfluids, recently observed in tilted Er gases, is another fertile area for future research, offering insights into the universal behavior of these systems [[4]]. The ultimate goal is to create a truly isolated 2D platform where the rich interplay between quantum fluctuations and long-range interactions can be studied in its most pristine form.\n\nAnother key direction is the exploration of binary and multicomponent dipolar quantum gases. Mixtures of different dipolar species, such as ¹⁶⁶Er and ¹⁶⁴Dy, offer a new degree of tunability and the potential to realize even richer phase diagrams, including complex spatial configurations like rings and wings [[14]]. The study of miscibility and phase separation in these systems can provide deep insights into the competition between different DDI strengths and masses [[14]]. Extending these studies to include fermionic and bosonic polar molecules, such as NaCs and KRb, is also a priority [[4,9]]. The strong electric DDI in these molecules, combined with the ability to manipulate internal molecular states, could enable the exploration of new types of quantum matter, including dipolar spin liquids and self-organized crystal phases [[9]].\n\nFrom an experimental technique perspective, the development of more sophisticated probes and controls will be paramount. Beyond the current use of Bragg spectroscopy and superradiance, new methods for probing coherence, entanglement, and correlations will be needed to fully characterize the subtle properties of supersolids and quantum droplets. The design of novel trap geometries, such as toroidal and ring-shaped potentials, will allow for the study of fundamental questions related to superfluidity, such as the dynamics of persistent currents and the formation of Josephson vortices [[12]]. The continued development of blue-detuned traps and other loss-suppression schemes will be essential for extending the lifetimes of these fragile quantum systems, enabling longer and more complex experiments [[5,12]].\n\nIn conclusion, the experimental study of magnetic quantum gases has evolved from a niche subfield into a central pillar of modern atomic, molecular, and optical physics. The journey, beginning with the first dipolar BEC in chromium and culminating in the recent discovery of supersolids and quantum droplets in dysprosium and erbium, has revealed a universe of novel quantum phenomena. The field has successfully harnessed the unique properties of long-range, anisotropic interactions to engineer and probe new states of matter, providing a powerful platform for quantum simulation. The remaining challenges—overcoming losses, accessing the 2D regime, and refining theoretical descriptions—serve as a roadmap for future endeavors.
