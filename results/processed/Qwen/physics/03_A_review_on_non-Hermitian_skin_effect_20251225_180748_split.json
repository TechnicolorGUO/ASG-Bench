      "content": "The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) represents a paradigm-shifting phenomenon in modern physics, fundamentally altering our understanding of how quantum and classical systems behave under open boundary conditions. At its core, the NHSE describes the anomalous condensation of a system's bulk eigenstates at its boundaries, a behavior that starkly contrasts with the well-established principles of Hermitian physics where states are typically extended throughout the volume. This localization is not merely a surface phenomenon but a deep structural feature of non-Hermitian systems, driven by non-reciprocal couplings or gain and loss mechanisms that break the time-reversal symmetry inherent in Hermitian Hamiltonians. The research motivation for studying the NHSE stems from its profound theoretical implications, which challenge foundational concepts such as Bloch's theorem and the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence, and its vast potential for technological applications in wave manipulation, sensing, and quantum information processing. Understanding the NHSE is therefore crucial for advancing both fundamental science and applied technology in diverse fields including photonics, acoustics, mechanics, and condensed matter physics.\n\nThe primary objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the field of non-Hermitian skin effects. It aims to trace the historical development of the concept from its initial theoretical predictions to its current status as a vibrant area of experimental and theoretical research. By synthesizing the extensive literature available, this report will delve into the key concepts, mathematical formalisms, and physical mechanisms that govern the skin effect. It will explore the remarkable progress made in experimentally realizing the NHSE across a multitude of platforms, analyze the diverse applications being developed, and critically assess the challenges and open questions that define the frontiers of the field. Furthermore, this review will identify critical research gaps and propose future directions, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of the research and the collaborative efforts required to unlock the full potential of non-Hermitian systems. Through this structured examination, we seek to present a clear and insightful overview of the NHSE, serving as an essential resource for researchers entering this exciting domain.",

      "content": "The conceptual framework of the non-Hermitian skin effect rests upon a set of interwoven ideas that redefine the relationship between a system's topology, its spectrum, and its spatial structure. Central to this new paradigm is the distinction between two different types of boundary conditions: periodic boundary conditions (PBC), which form the basis of traditional band theory, and open boundary conditions (OBC), where the system has distinct ends or surfaces. In Hermitian systems, the thermodynamic limit of the energy spectrum obtained under PBC and OBC often coincides, allowing for the robust prediction of material properties from the bulk. However, the NHSE demonstrates that for a wide class of non-Hermitian systems, these two spectra are fundamentally different, invalidating the standard bulk-boundary correspondence [[2,7]]. This spectral disparity is the defining characteristic of the skin effect.\n\nThe physical manifestation of the NHSE is the exponential localization of nearly all eigenmodes at one or both boundaries of the system [[3]]. This occurs when the system's dynamics involve non-reciprocal couplings, where the interaction strength from site A to site B differs from that from site B to site A, or when there is an asymmetric distribution of gain and loss [[2,10]]. The Hatano-Nelson model serves as the canonical minimal model illustrating this effect, describing particles on a one-dimensional lattice with asymmetric hopping amplitudes [[2,7]]. For such a system under OBC, all eigenstates localize at the same edge, a direct consequence of the imbalance in coupling strengths. This localization is characterized by a skin depth that remains finite even as the system size approaches infinity, a property that distinguishes it from Anderson localization due to disorder.\n\nA cornerstone of the modern understanding of the NHSE is the concept of the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). Traditional Bloch theory relies on a Brillouin zone defined by real wave vectors. However, for non-Hermitian systems, it was shown that the OBC spectrum can be correctly calculated by analytically continuing the wave vector into the complex plane, leading to a GBZ that may be topologically distinct from the standard unit circle [[2,7]]. The number of times the GBZ winds around the origin is directly related to the number of OBC eigenvalues, providing a powerful link between topology and spectrum. This insight has been formalized within the framework of non-Bloch band theory, which generalizes the principles of band theory to account for the effects of non-Hermiticity [[5,7]].\n\nThe topological origins of the NHSE have been a subject of intense research. It has been established that the skin effect is rooted in the presence of point gaps in the complex energy spectrum of the system under PBC [[5,9]]. These point gaps, which are regions in the complex plane where no eigenenergies exist, can support a spectral winding number—a topological invariant that counts how many times the PBC energy spectrum wraps around a given point in the gap. This winding number has been proven to determine the direction and existence of the skin modes [[2,7]]. More recently, the field has moved towards a more unified perspective, identifying the intrinsic non-Hermitian topology as the source of the skin effect, which can lead to novel phenomena like the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ skin effect protected by time-reversal symmetry or the $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ skin effect protected by glide symmetry [[6,18]]. This topological classification reveals a rich landscape of possible skin effects, enriching the taxonomy of topological phases beyond what is possible in Hermitian systems.",

      "content": "The journey of the non-Hermitian skin effect from a mathematical curiosity to a central topic in physics is marked by several key milestones that reflect a gradual shift in understanding. The conceptual roots of the phenomenon can be traced back to the work of Hatano and Nelson in 1996, who investigated localization transitions in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, particularly in the context of vortices pinned by columnar defects in type-II superconductors [[7]]. Their work on a one-dimensional lattice with an imaginary vector potential provided the first theoretical description of a system where disorder-like localization arises from a non-Hermitian term rather than random potentials, effectively laying the groundwork for the study of non-Hermitian systems. This seminal paper highlighted that the eigenstates of such a system would localize at the edges, a direct precursor to the modern NHSE.\n\nFor nearly two decades following the Hatano-Nelson work, the broader physics community largely viewed non-Hermitian Hamiltonians as mathematical constructs with questionable physical relevance. The prevailing wisdom held that any physical theory must be described by a Hermitian operator to ensure real energy spectra and unitary time evolution. This view was challenged by Carl M. Bender and colleagues, who pioneered the study of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics [[1]]. They proposed replacing the stringent Hermiticity condition with the weaker requirement of space-time reflection (PT) symmetry. If this symmetry is unbroken, the Hamiltonian can be non-Hermitian yet still possess a real and positive energy spectrum, thus preserving the physical consistency of the theory [[1]]. Models such as $H = p^2 + ix^3$ were shown to have real spectra, and the Lee Model, a relativistic field theory plagued by \"ghost\" states with negative norm, was re-examined using a newly constructed CPT inner product, revealing that these ghost states become physical with positive norms, cementing the theoretical foundation for physically viable non-Hermitian theories [[1]].\n\nThe true explosion in interest in the NHSE began around 2018, marking a period of rapid theoretical and experimental progress. A pivotal moment was the work of Yao and Yang, who established the definitive connection between the skin effect and topology [[7]]. They demonstrated that the breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems is not a failure of the theory but is instead dictated by a new topological principle [[3]]. Around the same time, Yokomizo and Murakami, along with Gong and coworkers, independently developed the mathematical framework of non-Bloch band theory and the concept of the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) [[4,7]]. This provided the long-sought-after rigorous tool to calculate the OBC spectrum from the PBC Hamiltonian, resolving the apparent paradox and establishing a new, correct bulk-boundary correspondence for non-Hermitian systems. This period also saw the identification of the NHSE's origin in spectral winding numbers and the realization that the effect could be controlled by symmetries, leading to the discovery of symmetry-enriched skin effects [[6,10]]. The confluence of these theoretical breakthroughs created a fertile ground for experimental verification.\n\nThis theoretical surge was immediately followed by a wave of experimental observations across multiple physical platforms, confirming the widespread validity of the NHSE. Within a short span, the effect was reported in photonic systems, topolectrical circuits, phononic crystals, ultracold atoms, and mechanical lattices [[4,7,8,10,11,12]]. Notably, experiments successfully realized the dynamic version of the NHSE, observing phenomena like directional amplification and unidirectional wave propagation [[10,14]]. More recent developments have pushed the boundaries further, exploring higher-order skin effects, the influence of interactions in many-body systems, and the role of nonlinearity and crystal defects [[3,20]]. This rapid transition from abstract theory to tangible reality across diverse disciplines marks the NHSE as a paradigm of modern physics, showcasing the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and the deep connections between seemingly disparate fields of science.",

      "content": "The remarkable theoretical progress in understanding the non-Hermitian skin effect has been paralleled by a prolific series of experimental demonstrations across a wide array of physical platforms. These experiments have been instrumental in validating the key predictions of non-Bloch band theory and have begun to uncover new facets of the skin effect, pushing the boundaries of controllable non-Hermitian physics. The ability to engineer non-reciprocity and gain-loss asymmetry with high precision has enabled physicists to create synthetic gauge fields and tailor dissipation, paving the way for these groundbreaking observations.\n\nOne of the most prominent platforms for studying the NHSE is photonics. Experiments have utilized arrays of coupled optical waveguides, where non-Hermiticity is induced either through artificial gauge fields created by periodic bending modulation of the waveguides or through engineered on-site losses [[7,13]]. Xiao et al. demonstrated the NHSE in a photonic lattice where light propagation showed clear boundary localization, and the direction of this localization could be tuned by adjusting the waveguide modulation parameter and the sublattice where losses were applied [[13]]. Similarly, Weidemann et al. observed the skin effect in a system of coupled waveguides, confirming the collapse of the PBC Brillouin zone onto a single point in the OBC spectrum [[7]]. These photonic experiments provide direct, real-space visualization of the effect.\n\nTopolectrical circuits have emerged as another versatile platform, allowing for the simulation of quantum mechanical problems using classical electrical components [[4,7]]. Helbig et al. experimentally realized the NHSE in a one-dimensional chain of LC resonators with nonreciprocal elements, observing the expected boundary-localized impedance profiles that match theoretical predictions [[7]]. These circuits offer the advantage of being easily tunable and directly measurable, making them ideal for studying the dynamic aspects of the skin effect. Acoustic systems have also been used to great effect. Phononic crystals, consisting of periodic arrangements of scatterers, have been designed to exhibit non-Hermitian behavior through carefully placed gain and loss elements [[8,11]]. Experiments by Guo et al. confirmed the geometry-dependent skin effect, where skin modes appeared only in samples with specific shapes, directly linking the effect to the topological properties of the underlying Fermi arcs connecting exceptional points in momentum space [[11]].\n\nThe realm of cold atoms provides a highly clean and controllable environment for exploring fundamental physics. Gyu-Boong Jo and colleagues realized a two-dimensional NHSE in an ultracold Fermi gas trapped in a spin-orbit-coupled optical lattice [[16]]. By introducing tunable dissipation, they observed nonzero spectral winding numbers and measured the real-space dynamical signatures of the skin effect via the center-of-mass motion of the atomic cloud. This experiment provided compelling evidence for the existence of the 2D NHSE and the associated momentum-space topology of exceptional points and Fermi arcs [[16]]. Mechanical systems represent a particularly exciting frontier, offering intuitive visualizations of the effect. Zhen Li and colleagues demonstrated the dynamic NHSE in a nonreciprocal double-chain mechanical system with glide-time symmetry, observing tunable wave dynamics ranging from symmetric propagation to unidirectional amplification and trapping at the boundaries [[10,14]]. These experiments highlight the control afforded by symmetry, where tuning parameters can drive the system through different dynamic phases corresponding to weak and strong skin effects [[14]].\n\nFinally, the field has seen forays into the quantum regime. The most significant achievement to date was the observation of the single-particle and many-fermion NHSE on a digital quantum computer [[12]]. Using IBM's superconducting qubit platforms, researchers implemented the Hatano-Nelson and non-Hermitian SSH models, directly measuring the boundary accumulation of single-particle states. In the many-body case, they observed the formation of a \"Fermi skin,\" where interacting fermions develop a density profile localized at the boundary, analogous to a spatial Fermi-Dirac distribution [[12]]. This pioneering work opens the door to simulating complex non-Hermitian phenomena that are intractable for classical computers, representing a major step forward in quantum simulation.

      "content": "As the field of non-Hermitian physics matures, research is moving beyond the characterization of the standard skin effect towards the exploration of more complex and nuanced phenomena. Several advanced topics have emerged as active areas of investigation, each revealing a deeper layer of complexity and potential functionality within non-Hermitian systems. These include the study of higher-order skin effects, the profound impact of symmetry, the extension of concepts to interacting many-body systems, and the development of novel detection methods.\n\nHigher-order skin effects represent a significant departure from the standard boundary localization. While the first-order NHSE localizes states at the edges, second-order skin effects cause the states to accumulate at the corners of a two-dimensional system, leaving the edges largely depleted [[3,4]]. This phenomenon has been theoretically predicted and subsequently identified in various systems, including acoustic metamaterials and topolectrical circuits [[4,20]]. Its experimental discovery was notably facilitated by machine learning techniques, where Shang et al. used physics-informed graph neural networks to automatically detect the unique signatures of second-order skin modes in simulated data [[4,20]]. This fusion of AI with condensed matter physics highlights a new methodology for discovering and characterizing exotic phases of matter. Beyond second order, Kawabata et al. explored the possibility of higher-order skin effects in systems with additional internal degrees of freedom, such as pseudospins, further expanding the zoo of non-Hermitian topological states [[3]].\n\nSymmetry plays a crucial role in shaping the nature of the skin effect, leading to the concept of symmetry-enriched NHSE. The presence of certain symmetries can protect the skin effect, modify its characteristics, or even give rise to entirely new types of skin physics. For example, the glide-time (*GT*) symmetry in a nonreciprocal double-chain mechanical system was shown to produce a richer dynamic phase diagram and enable controllable wave manipulation, including the emergence of multi-loop structures in the generalized Brillouin zone [[10,14]]. Perhaps the most striking example is the discovery of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ skin effect, which was experimentally realized in bilayer acoustic metamaterials protected by projective mirror symmetry [[15]]. This finding is particularly significant because it demonstrates that a skin effect can exist in a spinless system without requiring an external magnetic field, opening up new possibilities for device design. Another important development is the discovery of a $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological invariant protecting the NHSE in two-dimensional systems with glide symmetry, revealing a non-trivial interplay between nonsymmorphic symmetry and non-Hermitian topology [[18]].\n\nThe extension of the NHSE to many-body interacting systems introduces a whole new dimension of complexity and richness. The many-fermion analog of the skin effect is known as the \"Fermi skin.\" In a groundbreaking experiment, D. Zou et al. demonstrated the formation of a Fermi skin on a digital quantum computer [[12]]. By preparing a half-filled initial state of interacting fermions in a non-Hermitian SSH model, they observed that the system evolved into a steady-state density profile that resembled a spatial Fermi-Dirac distribution, with particle density exponentially decaying from the boundary. This was characterized by an effective inverse temperature proportional to the non-Hermitian parameter, showcasing how interactions can induce collective localization phenomena [[12]]. Theoretical studies have also explored the competition between interaction-induced clustering and the localization tendency of the non-Hermitian skin effect, suggesting that repulsive interactions can lead to reversed localization [[12]].\n\nFinally, the field is developing sophisticated tools for detecting and characterizing these intricate phenomena. As mentioned, machine learning algorithms are proving to be powerful allies in identifying higher-order skin effects and other subtle signatures in complex datasets [[4,20]]. On the theoretical front, the introduction of the \"uniform spectrum\" provides a unified framework for understanding the energy spectra of non-Hermitian systems, showing that the spectrum is universally determined regardless of boundary conditions, although the nature of the eigenstates (skin or bulk) depends on the geometry [[5,9]]. This concept helps connect skin modes across different lattice geometries via momentum-basis transformations. Furthermore, a very recent development proposes a generalized theory that goes beyond the GBZ framework, introducing the concept of a \"relative skin effect\" that accounts for the competition between different types of non-Hermitian terms, challenging the sole reliance on momentum-space descriptions [[17]]. Together, these advanced topics paint a picture of a field that is rapidly evolving from simply observing the skin effect to designing and controlling a rich tapestry of non-Hermitian phenomena.",

      "content": "Despite the tremendous progress made in the last decade, the field of non-Hermitian skin physics faces several significant challenges and open problems that define its future trajectory. Addressing these issues is crucial for transitioning the field from fundamental discovery to practical application and for achieving a complete and unified theoretical understanding. The primary hurdles lie in managing the detrimental effects of noise and disorder, extending theoretical frameworks to more complex scenarios, and navigating the path towards scalable quantum simulations.\n\nOne of the most pressing challenges is the sensitivity of the NHSE to disorder and noise. The skin effect is inherently a coherent phenomenon, and its manifestations—such as perfectly localized edge states and sharp spectral features—are fragile against perturbations. In realistic experimental systems, imperfections in fabrication, fluctuations in control parameters, and environmental noise can wash out the pristine signatures of the skin effect. For instance, in mechanical and electronic systems, damping and thermal noise can obscure the delicate balance between non-reciprocity and gain/loss. In quantum computing implementations, decoherence and gate errors pose a formidable barrier to observing the many-body Fermi skin over long timescales. Developing robustness criteria and engineering strategies to mitigate these effects is a critical area of ongoing research. This includes exploring whether certain types of disorder might actually stabilize the skin effect or if feedback control schemes can be designed to dynamically counteract noise.\n\nAnother major open problem is the complete theoretical classification and understanding of skin effects in higher dimensions. While much progress has been made in two-dimensional systems, particularly those connected to exceptional points and Fermi arcs, a universal theory that encompasses all possible geometries, boundary conditions, and symmetries is still lacking. The recent introduction of the \"uniform spectrum\" offers a promising new direction by focusing on the universal properties of the energy spectrum itself, independent of boundary conditions [[5,9]]. However, a complete mapping of all possible topological invariants and their corresponding geometric and dynamic consequences remains an ambitious goal. Furthermore, the recent proposal of a relative skin effect suggests that the current GBZ-based theories may be incomplete, indicating that real-space details of the non-Hermitian terms play a more significant role than previously thought [[17]]. Resolving this tension and integrating real-space and momentum-space perspectives into a single cohesive theory is a key future direction.\n\nThe intersection of non-Hermitian physics with many-body interactions and quantum phenomena presents both immense opportunities and significant technical challenges. While the initial observation of the Fermi skin was a landmark achievement, much remains to be understood about the interplay between interactions, non-Hermiticity, and topology [[12]]. Questions regarding the stability of the Fermi skin against stronger interactions, the nature of the steady states reached in strongly interacting non-Hermitian systems, and the potential for new forms of non-Hermitian entanglement remain largely unexplored. The successful demonstration of the NHSE on a digital quantum computer signals a new frontier, but scaling these experiments to larger qubit numbers while maintaining fidelity is a formidable task [[12]]. Future research will likely focus on improving error mitigation techniques, developing more efficient variational quantum algorithms tailored for non-Hermitian systems, and leveraging NISQ-era devices to simulate increasingly complex non-Hermitian many-body Hamiltonians that are inaccessible to classical computation.\n\nIn conclusion, the future of non-Hermitian skin physics lies in a concerted effort to address these challenges. This involves a synergistic combination of theoretical innovation, experimental ingenuity, and computational power. Future research will undoubtedly focus on building more robust and controllable platforms, refining theoretical frameworks to capture the full complexity of non-Hermitian systems, and exploring the emergent phenomena in interacting and quantum regimes. The ultimate goal is to harness the unique properties of the skin effect for transformative technologies, such as ultra-sensitive sensors that exploit boundary-localized states, directional amplifiers with unprecedented performance, and novel quantum processors that leverage non-Hermitian dynamics for enhanced computational capabilities. The journey from fundamental discovery to technological application is just beginning, and the coming years promise to be as intellectually stimulating as they are practically impactful.\n\n---",
