      "content": "The pursuit of a fulfilling life is a universal human endeavor, yet the metrics used to assess societal progress have historically been dominated by economic indicators like Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This paradigm began to shift in the early 21st century with a growing recognition that material wealth does not fully capture the quality of human existence. The landmark 2009 Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress delivered a pivotal report arguing for the inclusion of subjective well-being (SWB) in official statistics, challenging the long-standing hegemony of objective measures [[4,5]]. This call was further amplified by the work of the High-Level Group on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress (HLEG), which sought to address the technical and conceptual challenges of measuring societal advancement beyond GDP [[8]]. This intellectual and political movement has catalyzed an unprecedented expansion of research into SWB from both psychological and public health perspectives, transforming it from a niche topic into a central concern for policymakers, clinicians, and social scientists.\n\nThis systematic literature review aims to provide a comprehensive synthesis of the current state of knowledge on subjective well-being, integrating findings from psychology and public health. The primary motivation for this review is to map the evolving definitions, methodologies, and applications of SWB, while critically analyzing the field's progress, persistent challenges, and future trajectories. By adopting a dual-perspective approach, this review seeks to bridge disciplinary divides and illuminate how these two fields contribute unique but complementary insights to our understanding of what makes life worth living. Psychology offers deep theoretical models of motivation and personality that explain the internal drivers of well-being, while public health provides the epidemiological tools and population-level perspective necessary to understand its distribution, determinants, and impact on societal outcomes. The convergence of these perspectives is critical for developing interventions and policies that are not only effective at improving individual lives but also equitable and sustainable at a community level.\n\nThe specific objectives of this review are threefold. First, it will delineate the core concepts, definitions, and historical milestones that have shaped the modern study of subjective well-being, tracing its evolution from philosophical inquiry to a rigorously measured scientific construct. Second, it will conduct a detailed analysis of the current methodological landscape, examining the diverse techniques used for measurement, the key determinants identified across multiple studies, and the frameworks that seek to integrate them. Third, it will explore the practical applications of SWB research, focusing on its role in public policy and its use in clinical and technological interventions. Finally, this review will identify significant gaps and open problems in the literature, such as issues of cultural validity and measurement equivalence, and conclude by outlining promising future directions that promise to advance our understanding and application of subjective well-being in the years to come. Through this systematic examination, the review aims to serve as a foundational resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers navigating this complex and vital domain.",

      "content": "Subjective well-being (SWB) represents an individual’s personal, qualitative assessment of their own life, encompassing both cognitive judgments and emotional experiences [[1,12]]. It is inherently subjective, meaning it is based on a person's own perceptions and evaluations, and is often used synonymously with the concept of happiness [[1]]. The definition provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) captures its multifaceted nature, describing it as \"good mental states, including all of the various evaluations, positive and negative, that people make of their lives and the affective reactions of people to their experiences\" [[4]]. This broad construct is typically understood to include several distinct but related components, most commonly evaluative well-being, experienced well-being, and eudaimonic well-being. Evaluative well-being, also known as cognitive or reflective well-being, involves a person's overall judgment of their life, such as life satisfaction or global happiness [[2,4]]. Experienced well-being, or hedonic well-being, focuses on the real-time frequency and intensity of positive and negative emotions and feelings [[2]]. Eudaimonic well-being shifts the focus from mere feeling-good to feeling-meaningful, reflecting a person's sense of purpose, personal growth, self-acceptance, and fulfillment of their potential [[2,20]].\n\nThe conceptualization of SWB has evolved significantly over time, moving from simple dichotomies to more nuanced, multi-dimensional models. Early research often focused on the distinction between positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA), viewing them as largely independent dimensions rather than inverse reflections of each other [[2,3]]. Ed Diener, a foundational figure in the field, developed the tripartite model, which posits that SWB is composed of these two affective components—positive and negative—as well as a separate cognitive component of life satisfaction [[5,6]]. More recent large-scale empirical analyses have sought to determine the optimal structure of these components. One such study using data from three major longitudinal cohorts (MIDUS, GSOEP, HILDA) found strong support for a hierarchical model [[6]]. In this model, life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect are seen as indicators of a single, higher-order latent factor of SWB at both the between-person and within-person levels. While the causal systems model, where PA and NA directly cause changes in LS, received less consistent support, the hierarchical model provides a robust framework for understanding the common variance underlying these different facets of well-being [[6]].\n\nA crucial distinction exists between SWB and broader conceptions of well-being. While SWB is an individual's subjective evaluation, broader well-being frameworks incorporate objective conditions of life, such as material circumstances, health status, environmental quality, and social connections [[4]]. The OECD Well-being Framework, for instance, distinguishes between the subjective components (life evaluation, affect, eudaimonia) and the objective components (such as income, education, environment, governance) that contribute to a person's overall quality of life [[4]]. Similarly, the World Happiness Report acknowledges that while it measures SWB, its rankings are influenced by factors like GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption [[5]]. This distinction is critical for public health and policy, as it highlights that while SWB reflects an individual's inner world, its determinants are deeply embedded in the objective structures of society. Understanding this relationship allows for the development of interventions that target not only individual psychology but also the social and environmental factors that shape people's lives.\n\n| **Component** | **Definition** | **Example Measures** | **Relevant Sources** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Evaluative Well-being** | Cognitive judgment of one's life as a whole; life satisfaction. | Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS); Cantril Ladder; Single-item 0-10 scale. | `[[1]]`, `[[2]]`, `[[6]]` |\n| **Experienced Well-being** | Real-time emotional/affective states; hedonic tone. | Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS/PANAS-X); Day Reconstruction Method (DRM); Experience Sampling Method (ESM). | `[[1]]`, `[[2]]`, `[[5]]` |\n| **Eudaimonic Well-being** | Sense of meaning, purpose, personal growth, and self-actualization. | Ryff's Psychological Well-Being (PWB) Scales; Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale (BPNSFS); ONS question on 'worthwhileness'. | `[[2]]`, `[[20]]`, `[[11]]`, `[[13]]` |",

      "content": "The formal academic study of subjective well-being is a relatively young discipline, yet its roots can be traced back to ancient philosophical inquiries into happiness and flourishing. However, the field's rapid ascent and increasing influence on public policy are products of specific historical developments in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. A seminal moment was the 2009 publication of the final report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, chaired by economists Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen, and Jean-Paul Fitoussi [[4,5]]. Titled *Mismeasuring Our Lives: Why GDP Doesn't Add Up*, the report forcefully argued that reliance on GDP as the primary measure of national success was profoundly inadequate because it ignored critical aspects of human well-being, such as inequality, environmental degradation, and unpaid work [[8]]. The commission did not advocate for the abandonment of objective indicators but recommended the systematic collection of subjective well-being data alongside them, a recommendation that fundamentally reshaped the discourse on societal progress [[20]].\n\nFollowing the commission's release, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) established the High-Level Group on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress (HLEG) to develop practical guidelines for implementing its recommendations [[8]]. The HLEG's work culminated in the 2013 publication of the *Guidelines on Measuring Subjective Well-being*, a comprehensive document that set a new international standard for collecting and reporting SWB data in official statistics [[2]]. These guidelines provided concrete advice on survey design, question wording, and response scales, recommending a 0-to-10 numerical rating scale with clear verbal anchors for questions about life satisfaction and experienced emotions [[4]]. The guidelines' publication marked a turning point, leading to a dramatic increase in the collection of SWB data worldwide. By 2023, nearly 90% of OECD countries were regularly collecting data on life satisfaction through nationally representative surveys, demonstrating the widespread adoption of the HLEG's framework [[4]].\n\nThe UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) stands out as a pioneering institution in this area. In response to the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission's recommendations, the ONS launched its national wellbeing program in 2010, incorporating four core subjective well-being questions into its main household surveys [[2,20]]. These questions cover life satisfaction, feeling worthwhile, yesterday's happiness, and yesterday's anxiety, providing a rich dataset that has been used to produce regular reports since 2012 [[20]]. The ONS's efforts have served as a powerful proof-of-concept, demonstrating the feasibility and value of tracking SWB at a national level. This initiative has been instrumental in informing policy debates and has encouraged other nations to follow suit. The inclusion of SWB in official statistics has also led to its integration into formal policy-making processes. For example, the UK Treasury's Green Book Guidance now recommends that cost-benefit analyses consider impacts on subjective well-being, recognizing it as a valid outcome measure for public services [[4]]. This institutionalization of SWB marks a profound shift, moving it from a purely academic concept to a tangible consideration in the allocation of public resources.\n\nBeyond national statistics, large-scale international surveys have become a cornerstone of SWB research. The Gallup World Poll, which covers over 160 countries, has included SWB questions since 2005, enabling cross-national comparisons of happiness and life evaluation [[2]]. Similarly, the World Values Survey and the European Values Study have incorporated SWB items, creating vast datasets that allow researchers to explore the correlates of well-being across diverse cultures and political systems [[19]]. In addition to these large-scale surveys, many countries have developed their own long-running national surveys. Canada has collected SWB data since 1985 via its General Social Survey, Japan has conducted Life in Nation Surveys since 1958, and the United States has included an SWB module in its American Time Use Survey since 2010 [[2]]. The proliferation of these data sources has fueled a massive body of research and has been essential for testing theories of well-being across different contexts. This historical trajectory—from philosophical debate to academic inquiry, to a mandate from a high-level international commission, and finally to widespread implementation in national policy—demonstrates the remarkable journey of subjective well-being as a concept and a metric of societal health.",

      "content": "The rigorous study of subjective well-being relies on a sophisticated and continuously evolving toolkit of measurement methods. These methods range from simple self-report questionnaires to technologically advanced ecological momentary assessments (EMA), each with distinct strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate applications. The choice of method has profound implications for the validity and reliability of the resulting data, making it a central concern for researchers in both psychology and public health. Foundational self-report measures remain the backbone of much SWB research. Single-item global questions, such as the widely used 0-to-10 scale asking individuals to rate their overall satisfaction with life, are favored for their simplicity and low cognitive burden, making them ideal for large-scale national surveys [[1,4]]. Multi-item validated scales offer greater psychometric precision. The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), developed by Ed Diener et al., is a five-item scale measuring global cognitive judgments of life satisfaction [[1,10]]. For assessing affective components, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and its variants are among the most frequently used instruments, designed to capture the discrete experience of positive and negative emotions [[1,5,10]]. Other prominent scales include the Subjective Happiness Scale for a general global rating of happiness [[1]], and Ryff's Psychological Well-Being (PWB) Scales, which operationalize the eudaimonic dimension by assessing constructs like autonomy, environmental mastery, and purpose in life [[5,14]].\n\nWhile self-reports are ubiquitous, they are not without their limitations. Retrospective recall can be susceptible to memory biases, where individuals may distort their past emotional experiences due to cognitive shortcuts or selective memory [[3]]. To mitigate this, researchers have developed alternative methods that capture real-time experiences. The Experience Sampling Method (ESM), pioneered by Csikszentmihalyi and Larson, involves repeatedly prompting individuals throughout the day to report their current activities and feelings, thereby reducing reliance on flawed retrospective memory [[1]]. The Day Reconstruction Method (DRM), developed by Kahneman et al., is a hybrid approach where participants reconstruct their previous day by breaking it down into episodes and rating their experiences during each one [[1,2]]. Both ESM and DRM are considered superior for measuring experienced well-being as they provide a more accurate picture of daily emotional fluctuations. Furthermore, the rise of mobile technology has enabled the use of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) via smartphone apps, allowing for even more frequent and context-sensitive data collection in natural environments [[12]].\n\nDespite advances in methodology, the field faces significant challenges related to measurement validity and comparability. Response biases are a persistent issue, with factors like acquiescence bias (tendency to agree with statements), social desirability, and extreme responding potentially skewing results [[5]]. Method factors, such as the wording of items (e.g., positively vs. negatively worded), can also systematically influence responses and must be accounted for in statistical models [[16]]. Cultural differences in responding styles, such as the tendency of some cultures to avoid extreme positions on Likert scales (fence-sitting) or to use scales more liberally (extreme responding), pose a major threat to the cross-cultural comparability of SWB data [[2,5]]. The mode of data collection itself can introduce variability; studies show that web-based surveys can yield systematically lower SWB scores compared to in-person or phone interviews, possibly due to differences in engagement or perceived anonymity [[4,5]]. These challenges underscore the need for careful survey design, including pre-testing with target populations and using validated scales that have been properly calibrated for different cultural contexts. The table below summarizes some of the key measurement tools and their characteristics.\n\n| **Method/Tool** | **Type** | **Primary Use** | **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** | **Relevant Sources** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Single-Item Global Question** | Self-Report | Large-National Surveys | Simple, quick, low burden, good for trends | Less reliable, lacks detail, sensitive to context | `[[1]]`, `[[4]]` |\n| **Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS)** | Self-Report | Evaluative Well-being | High reliability, widely used, measures cognition | Vulnerable to retrospective bias | `[[1]]`, `[[10]]` |\n| **Positive & Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)** | Self-Report | Experienced Well-being | Measures discrete affects, psychometrically sound | Reflects momentary state, not stable trait | `[[1]]`, `[[10]]` |\n| **Day Reconstruction Method (DRM)** | Hybrid (Self-Report + ESM) | Experienced Well-being | Reduces retrospective bias, provides context | Relies on memory of past day, can be burdensome | `[[1]]`, `[[2]]` |\n| **Experience Sampling Method (ESM)** | Real-Time (EMA) | Experienced Well-being | Captures real-time affect, high ecological validity | Burdensome for participants, requires technology | `[[1]]`, `[[2]]` |\n| **Ryff's Psychological Well-Being (PWB) Scales** | Self-Report | Eudaimonic Well-being | Comprehensive theory-driven, assesses functioning | Poor item reliability in some studies, complex | `[[5]]`, `[[14]]`, `[[13]]` |",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Understanding the factors that influence subjective well-being is fundamental to both psychological theory-building and public health intervention. Research has identified a wide array of determinants spanning basic demographics, socioeconomic status, health, personality, social relationships, and cultural context. Across these domains, social relationships consistently emerge as one of the most powerful predictors of well-being. Strong social bonds and supportive networks are associated with higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction [[3]]. Evidence shows that individuals who feel connected and supported by others tend to report better well-being, even in the face of adversity [[10]]. Conversely, social isolation and loneliness are strongly linked to poorer mental health and lower SWB [[10]]. The importance of social support is so pronounced that it is often cited as a primary mechanism through which other factors, such as community engagement or religious involvement, promote well-being [[10]].\n\nSocioeconomic status (SES) is another critical determinant, though its relationship with SWB is complex. Income is positively correlated with SWB, particularly up to the point where basic needs are met [[10,20]]. Beyond this threshold, however, the returns diminish significantly, a phenomenon known as the Easterlin paradox [[12]]. This suggests that while poverty is a major source of unhappiness, increased wealth alone does not guarantee greater happiness [[12]]. Unemployment is a potent negative predictor of SWB, harming well-being not just through financial strain but also through its impact on identity, purpose, and social status [[10,12]]. Other aspects of SES, such as education and family structure, also play a role, with higher educational attainment generally linked to better health behaviors and more opportunities, which in turn can contribute to higher well-being [[10]]. Personality traits, particularly those described by the Big Five model, are highly influential. Neuroticism is consistently negatively correlated with SWB, while extraversion is positively correlated [[3]]. Optimism and self-efficacy—the belief in one's ability to achieve goals—are also strong positive predictors of well-being [[10]].\n\nHealth and physical functioning represent a cornerstone of well-being. There is a robust and well-documented link between good physical health, adequate sleep, and regular physical activity and higher levels of SWB [[10,12]]. Chronic illness and disability are consistently associated with lower well-being, underscoring the profound impact of physical suffering on quality of life [[10]]. Interestingly, while depression and anxiety are identified as primary drivers of reduced well-being, their impact can sometimes surpass that of physical health concerns [[19]]. This highlights the inseparable link between mental and physical health. In contrast, genetic factors account for a substantial portion of the variance in happiness, estimated at 30–50%, suggesting a biological predisposition toward a certain baseline level of well-being [[12]]. This \"set-point\" theory posits that individuals tend to return to a characteristic level of happiness after major life events, although this set-point can be influenced by intentional activities and life circumstances [[3]].\n\nCultural context plays a crucial role in shaping both the experience and expression of well-being. Individualistic cultures, prevalent in Western societies, tend to emphasize personal achievement, autonomy, and the pursuit of individual happiness [[3]]. In contrast, collectivistic cultures, common in East Asia, place a greater emphasis on group harmony, social obligations, and interdependence, which can lead to different conceptions of what constitutes a good life [[3]]. This cultural variation means that universal scales and interpretations of SWB must be approached with caution. Studies have shown that the determinants of SWB can differ across cultures, and response styles can vary, affecting the comparability of scores [[2,5]]. For example, while autonomy is universally important for well-being, its expression and valuation may differ [[11]]. The challenge for researchers is to move beyond surface-level descriptions of cultural differences and develop culturally sensitive measurement tools and theories that can account for these variations. This requires a deep understanding of local values, norms, and practices that define well-being within a specific cultural milieu.",

      "content": "The growing body of evidence linking subjective well-being to positive life outcomes has spurred numerous applications in public health and clinical practice. At the macro level, SWB data is increasingly being used to inform public policy and guide resource allocation. As noted, the inclusion of SWB in official statistics by bodies like the UK's ONS allows governments to monitor societal trends in well-being and use it as an early warning indicator for emerging health crises or economic downturns [[4,20]]. This data can also serve as a crucial input for cost-benefit analyses in policy design, ensuring that proposed interventions are evaluated not only on their economic efficiency but also on their potential to enhance citizens' quality of life [[4]]. An innovative application is the use of Wellbeing Adjusted Life Years (WALYs), a metric derived from life satisfaction data, to quantify the non-fatal burden of disease and the impact of health systems on well-being. One study using WALYs found that Universal Health Coverage had a small but positive effect on SWB, highlighting its utility in assessing the holistic impact of healthcare policies [[19]].\n\nIn the realm of clinical practice, SWB research informs the development of interventions aimed at enhancing resilience, preventing mental illness, and improving treatment outcomes. The finding that positive affect is associated with enhanced self-confidence, better relational interactions, and improved work performance suggests that fostering well-being can create a positive feedback loop that drives success and recovery [[3]]. Interventions based on positive psychology principles, such as gratitude exercises or acts of kindness, are designed specifically to boost well-being. Furthermore, the strong correlation between high SWB and longevity underscores the importance of promoting well-being as a public health strategy for improving population health outcomes [[20]]. The identification of depression and anxiety as primary drivers of reduced well-being reinforces the need for accessible mental health services and preventive strategies targeting these conditions [[19]].\n\nTechnology has opened up new frontiers for applying SWB science in clinical and wellness settings. Mobile health (mHealth) applications represent a scalable way to deliver interventions directly to individuals. The MyStrengths app, for example, is a gamefully designed tool intended to help individuals with chronic illnesses use their personal strengths to manage their condition [[9]]. Although its trial showed modest improvements in a single health subscale, the overwhelmingly positive user feedback on the core strengths-based approach suggests its potential as a tool for self-management and building mastery [[9]]. Such tools are particularly valuable for reaching populations that may have limited access to traditional therapy. They can provide low-threshold support and empower individuals to take an active role in their own well-being. The integration of SWB measures into routine clinical care could also allow for personalized medicine, where treatment plans are tailored not only to symptoms but also to a patient's overall sense of well-being and life goals. This would align clinical practice more closely with the biopsychosocial model of health, which recognizes the interconnectedness of biological, psychological, and social factors in determining health outcomes. The ultimate goal of these applications is to translate abstract scientific findings into tangible tools and policies that can improve the quality of life for individuals and communities.",

      "heading": "Critical Analysis, Open Problems, and Future Directions",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Despite significant progress, the field of subjective well-being research is characterized by several critical challenges and unresolved debates that highlight important open problems. A primary weakness lies in the methodological and theoretical underpinnings of eudaimonic well-being. While the hedonic dimension of SWB (experienced pleasure and pain) is relatively well-defined and measured with standardized tools, the eudaimonic dimension remains elusive and poorly theorized [[10,11]]. The lack of consensus on how to best operationalize concepts like purpose, meaning, and self-actualization hinders comparative research and the development of targeted interventions [[11]]. The OECD has acknowledged this gap, noting the undertheorized nature of eudaimonic well-being [[11]]. Another major challenge is the issue of cultural validity and measurement equivalence. The dominance of Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) samples in SWB research raises questions about the universality of findings [[11]]. Cultural differences in response styles, conceptualizations of well-being, and the very meaning of survey items threaten the validity of cross-national comparisons, a central goal of many large-scale initiatives [[2,5]]. Addressing these issues requires more culturally sensitive research designs and the development of measurement tools that are rigorously tested for invariance across diverse populations.\n\nA third critical weakness is the prevalence of cross-sectional studies, which limits the ability to draw conclusions about causality. Of the 105 empirical studies analyzed in one review, 83 were cross-sectional, with few using experimental designs [[10]]. Without longitudinal or experimental data, it is difficult to establish whether low income causes low well-being or if low well-being leads to unemployment. Similarly, it is unclear whether interventions that correlate with increases in SWB are truly responsible for the change or if other confounding variables are at play. This limitation points to a pressing need for more robust study designs, including randomized controlled trials and long-term longitudinal cohort studies that can track individuals over time to disentangle cause and effect.\n\nLooking forward, several promising research directions have the potential to address these challenges and advance the field. A key future direction is the development of more integrated theoretical frameworks that can unify the disparate concepts of well-being. The suggestion to integrate Self-Determination Theory (SDT) with Personality Systems Interactions (PSI) theory is a prime example. SDT explains well-being through the satisfaction of universal psychological needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness), while PSI explains volitional efficiency and personal growth through action versus state orientation [[18]]. Integrating these theories could create a more comprehensive model that accounts for both the motivational drive toward well-being (SDT) and the capacity to enact meaningful goals despite obstacles (PSI). This could provide a more complete explanation for why well-being changes occur and what can be done to foster it.\n\nAnother crucial direction is the continued innovation in measurement methods. The use of novel data sources like social media sentiment analysis, Google Trends, and crowdsourced platforms offers exciting possibilities for capturing real-time, unobtrusive data on population-level well-being [[12]]. These big data approaches can complement traditional survey methods by providing continuous streams of information that can be used for early warning systems or to study the immediate effects of events on mood. Furthermore, there is a need for more research that moves beyond correlational analyses to test causal mechanisms. Experimental designs that manipulate specific variables (e.g., workplace conditions, social support interventions) and measure subsequent changes in SWB are needed to build a stronger evidence base for effective interventions. Finally, the field must prioritize research that addresses health disparities and promotes equity. This includes studying SWB in marginalized and vulnerable populations, investigating how structural factors like discrimination and poverty impact well-being, and designing culturally competent interventions that are accessible to all. By pursuing these directions, the field can move closer to its ultimate goal: creating a science of well-being that not only understands what makes life good but also provides actionable solutions for building a happier, healthier, and more flourishing world for everyone.\n\n---",
