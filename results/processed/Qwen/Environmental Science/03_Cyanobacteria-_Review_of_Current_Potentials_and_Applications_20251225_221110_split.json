      "content": "Cyanobacteria represent one of the most ancient and evolutionarily significant groups of organisms on Earth, having fundamentally shaped the planet's atmosphere and biosphere over billions of years [[2,10]]. As the only known prokaryotic group capable of oxygenic photosynthesis, they are credited with initiating the Great Oxidation Event approximately 2.4 billion years ago, which laid the foundation for the development of aerobic life [[1,2]]. Their fossil record provides a window into early life, with unambiguous cyanobacterial fossils appearing as far back as 1.89–1.84 billion years ago in the Belcher Supergroup of Canada [[2]]. Despite their profound historical importance, it is their contemporary potential that has catalyzed a renaissance in scientific research and industrial interest. Today, these photosynthetic prokaryotes are at the forefront of efforts to develop sustainable biotechnologies aimed at producing biofuels, high-value chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and agricultural products from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) [[4,5]]. This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge on the potentials and applications of cyanobacteria, exploring their biological underpinnings, the technological advancements that enable their use as microbial cell factories, their diverse applications across multiple sectors, and the formidable challenges that must be overcome to translate their promise into widespread commercial reality.\n\nThe primary motivation for this review stems from the convergence of several critical global challenges, including climate change, resource depletion, and the need for sustainable production systems. Traditional chemical manufacturing and agriculture are heavily reliant on fossil fuels and intensive land and water use, contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation [[6]]. In contrast, cyanobacteria offer a compelling alternative by serving as direct, solar-powered bioproduction platforms. They can fix CO2 directly from ambient air or flue gas streams and grow autotrophically using sunlight and inorganic nutrients, thereby avoiding the \"food-versus-fuel\" debate associated with first- and second-generation biofuel feedstocks derived from crops [[21,22]]. Furthermore, their ability to thrive in non-arable lands and utilize various waste streams, such as wastewater, positions them as a cornerstone technology for a circular bioeconomy [[5,12]].\n\nThis review aims to provide a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the field, moving beyond isolated case studies to identify overarching trends, persistent bottlenecks, and future opportunities. It will delve into the fundamental biology and systematics that govern cyanobacterial diversity, explore the cutting-edge synthetic biology toolkit being used to engineer them, and critically evaluate their performance in pilot-scale and commercial applications. By examining the successes and failures across different application domains—from biofuels and bioplastics to pharmaceuticals and environmental remediation—this report seeks to illuminate the path forward for realizing the full potential of these remarkable microorganisms. The ultimate objective is to synthesize the available evidence to provide a clear-eyed assessment of where the field stands today and what it will take to transition from laboratory proof-of-concepts to robust, economically viable, and globally impactful biotechnological solutions.",

      "content": "To understand the immense potential and unique challenges of engineering cyanobacteria, it is essential to establish a foundational understanding of their biological nature and taxonomic classification. Cyanobacteria are Gram-negative, photoautotrophic prokaryotes, meaning they are single-celled organisms without a membrane-bound nucleus or organelles, capable of synthesizing their own food using light energy and inorganic carbon sources like CO2 [[4,21]]. They perform oxygenic photosynthesis, a process central to life on Earth, utilizing chlorophyll a and specialized protein complexes called phycobilisomes to capture light energy across the visible spectrum [[21]]. This capability distinguishes them from anoxygenic phototrophs and eukaryotic algae, whose photosynthetic machinery resides within membrane-bound chloroplasts [[3,21]]. Historically, their morphological similarities to eukaryotic algae led to their informal designation as 'blue-green algae' [[1]]. However, their bacterial nature has been recognized for over a century, placing them within the domain Bacteria [[1]].\n\nThe taxonomy of cyanobacteria has been a long-standing source of complexity and debate, stemming from their dual nomenclatural identity [[1]]. Both the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP) have historically governed their naming. This has resulted in some species being validly published under both codes, while others exist only under one, leading to confusion. For instance, as of a recent publication, only five species (*Halospirulina tapeticola*, *Prochlorococcus marinus*, *Prochloron didemni*, *Prochlorothrix hollandica*, and *Planktotricoides raciborskii*) were validly published under the bacteriological ICNP [[1]]. Foundational work by taxonomists such as Thuret (1875), Bornet & Flahaut (1887-1888a, b), Gomont (1892), and Geitler (1932) established much of the modern systematics, recognizing 1,300 species in 145 genera [[1]]. These early classifications relied heavily on phenotypic properties, a system sometimes referred to as the 'Geitlerian' approach [[1]].\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, a major shift occurred towards a more bacteriological classification system, advocated by figures like Waterbury & Stanier (1977) and Rippka et al. (1979), which emphasized the use of axenic cultures and molecular data [[1]]. More recently, Komárek & Anagnostidis (1999, 2005) proposed a compromise system that attempts to reconcile botanical nomenclature with modern genetic and bacteriological insights [[1]]. The advent of molecular biology has revolutionized our understanding of cyanobacterial phylogeny. Molecular markers such as the 16S rRNA gene, internal transcribed spacers (ITS), and nitrogenase genes (*nifH*) have provided unprecedented resolution, revealing complex evolutionary relationships and challenging traditional classifications [[1]]. For example, analyses of these markers have shown that genera like *Synechococcus* and *Phormidium* are polyphyletic, meaning they include species that do not share a common ancestor [[1]]. To address this, the concept of an ecotype has been proposed to define cohesive populations that are adapted to specific ecological niches, providing a more functional and dynamic way to classify cyanobacteria [[1]].\n\nThe genomic landscape of cyanobacteria reflects their vast diversity and adaptive capacity. As of December 2024, the NCBI GenBank database contained over 6,500 cyanobacterial sequences, a ~40-fold increase from the 178 sequences available between 1980 and 2013 [[7]]. The CyanoCyc database catalogs 277 genomes across 56 genera, with five of these manually annotated using data from over 1,760 publications [[7]]. This wealth of genomic information has revealed a staggering biosynthetic potential; over 56,000 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) have been identified, yet a striking finding is that more than 80% of these remain uncharacterized or orphaned, representing a vast, untapped reservoir of novel natural products [[6,7]]. This genomic diversity underpins the wide array of applications being explored, from metabolic engineering for chemical production to discovering new pharmaceuticals. The table below summarizes key characteristics of several model and fast-growing cyanobacterial strains frequently used in research.\n\n| Strain Designation | Genome Size (Mb) | GC Content (%) | Doubling Time (hours) | Key Characteristics and Model Status | Citations |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803** | 3.9 | 47.5 | 7–12 | Most studied strain for PHA synthesis; foundational chassis for genetic tools and metabolic engineering. | [[7,10,12]] |\n| **Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973** | 2.7 | 55.5 | ~1.9 | Fast-growing; used for production of 2,3-butanediol, limonene, ethanol, and PHB. | [[7,9,10,11]] |\n| **Anabaena sp. PCC 7120** | 7.2 | 41.5 | 14–15 | Nitrogen-fixing heterocyst-forming filamentous cyanobacterium; important for genetic manipulation studies. | [[6,7,10]] |\n| **Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942** | 3.4 | 49.0 | ~2.6 | Model strain for metabolic engineering and CRISPRi/a systems. | [[7,10,18,19]] |\n| **Synechococcus elongatus PCC 11801** | Unknown | Unknown | ~2.3 | One of the fastest growing strains; used for 2,3-butanediol production. | [[7,8,10,11]] |\n| **Synechococcus elongatus PCC 11901** | 3.5 | 49.0 | ~2.0 | Very fast-growing; shares high genome identity with PCC 7942. | [[7,9,10]] |\n\nThis extensive genomic and phenotypic diversity underscores why no single \"cyanobacterium\" exists. Instead, the field is leveraging the distinct advantages of different strains to solve specific problems, whether it is the genetic tractability of a lab model like *Synechocystis* sp. PCC 6803 or the rapid growth rate of engineered *Synechococcus elongatus* strains for high-titer production [[7,11]].",

      "content": "The burgeoning potential of cyanobacteria as sustainable bioproduction platforms is largely a product of rapid advancements in synthetic biology and genetic engineering. While genetic modification is inherently simpler in prokaryotes compared to eukaryotes, the development of a versatile and efficient toolbox for cyanobacteria has been a focus of intense research over the past two decades [[5]]. This effort has moved the field from a few well-established model strains to a broader platform capable of supporting complex metabolic engineering projects. The core of this toolkit revolves around CRISPR-based technologies, which have revolutionized the precision and efficiency with which genes can be edited, regulated, and manipulated.\n\nCRISPR-Cas systems, originally discovered as bacterial immune mechanisms, have been repurposed into a powerful suite of genetic tools. Cas9, a nuclease that creates double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA, has been successfully applied in numerous cyanobacterial strains, including the classic models *Synechocystis* sp. PCC 6803 and *Synechococcus elongatus* UTEX 2973 [[13]]. This allows for targeted gene knockouts, insertions, and markerless deletions [[8]]. Beyond simple cutting, variants like Cas12a (Cpf1) have also proven effective, enabling genome editing across diverse cyanobacteria [[10,13]]. The most prevalent type of CRISPR-Cas system found in sequenced cyanobacteria is Type I, particularly subtype I-D, which is dominant in orders like Nostocales and Leptolyngbyales [[8]]. A fascinating discovery is that endogenous Type I-D systems in *Synechococcus* sp. PCC 7002 can be harnessed for marker-less gene deletion and even the excision of entire plasmids, offering a built-in tool for genetic stabilization [[8]].\n\nBeyond gene knockout, controlling gene expression is paramount for metabolic engineering. Here again, CRISPR has provided elegant solutions through CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa). CRISPRi uses a nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) or dCas12a to bind to a target promoter, physically blocking transcription and effectively repressing gene expression [[14,16]]. This method has been successfully implemented in *Synechocystis* sp. PCC 6803 and *Synechococcus elongatus* PCC 7942, achieving repression efficiencies of up to 94-95% for multiplexed targets [[16,18]]. This has proven highly effective in redirecting metabolic flux away from competing pathways. For example, repressing the TCA cycle genes *ppc* and *gltA* in an isobutanol producer increased isobutanol titer 2.6-fold, while repressing *acnB* and *cpcB* improved squalene production by 82% [[19,20]]. Conversely, CRISPRa uses a catalytically dead Cas protein fused to an activator domain (e.g., SoxS) to enhance transcription. A rhamnose-inducible CRISPRa system in *Synechocystis* achieved up to 2.28-fold activation of weak promoters, synergistically boosting isobutanol production up to 6-fold when multiple genes were activated simultaneously [[15,17]].\n\nThe following table highlights the diversity of genetic tools now available for engineering cyanobacteria:\n\n| Tool Category | Specific Example(s) | Mechanism of Action | Application Examples | Citations |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Gene Editing** | CRISPR-Cas9, Cpf1 (Cas12a) | Creates DSBs for targeted gene insertion, deletion, or replacement. | Markerless gene deletion in *Synechococcus* sp. PCC 7002; genome editing in *Synechocystis* sp. PCC 6803. | [[8,13]] |\n| **Base Editors** | Cytosine base editors | Introduces point mutations without creating DSBs. | Engineered Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 produces 1-octanol. | [[13]] |\n| **Transcriptional Repression** | CRISPRi (dCas9/12a fused to a repressor) | Binds to promoter regions to block RNA polymerase. | Repressed TCA cycle genes to increase succinate and isobutanol production. | [[16,19,20]] |\n| **Transcriptional Activation** | CRISPRa (dCas9/12a fused to an activator) | Binds to promoter regions to recruit RNA polymerase. | Activated glycolytic genes to boost isobutanol production in *Synechocystis*. | [[15,17]] |\n| **Regulatory Elements** | Native Promoters (Pcpc560, P*rha*) | Control the timing and level of gene expression. | Used to drive inducer-free production of 2,3-BD in *Synechococcus* strains. | [[10,11,15]] |\n| **Vector Systems** | CYANO-VECTOR, CyanoGate | Modular cloning systems for constructing multi-gene expression cassettes. | Facilitates combinatorial metabolic engineering for producing trehalose and astaxanthin. | [[10,13]] |\n| **Omics Integration** | Isotopically nonstationary 13C-MFA, GSMM | Tracks metabolic flux and identifies bottlenecks. | Guided gene knockouts to optimize butanol and limonene production. | [[7,9]] |\n\nAlongside CRISPR, other components of the synthetic biology toolkit continue to mature. Researchers are developing inducible and constitutive promoters with varying strengths to fine-tune gene expression levels [[10]]. Riboswitches that respond to small molecules like theophylline or glutamine provide another layer of dynamic control [[10]]. Modular vector systems like CyanoGate simplify the construction of complex genetic circuits by allowing standardized assembly of promoters, coding sequences, and terminators [[10,13]]. Finally, advanced analytical techniques are crucial for guiding engineering efforts. Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) combined with flux balance analysis (FBA) and flux variability analysis (MVA) allow researchers to computationally predict metabolic bottlenecks and identify optimal gene targets for modification [[9,10]]. Similarly, isotopically nonstationary 13C-metreabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) enables real-time tracking of carbon flow through metabolic networks, providing empirical validation for model predictions [[7]]. Together, these integrated approaches are transforming cyanobacteria from a collection of interesting organisms into a sophisticated and programmable platform for industrial biotechnology.",

      "content": "The true measure of progress in the field of cyanobacterial biotechnology lies in its practical applications. Researchers have successfully engineered these microorganisms to produce a diverse portfolio of valuable compounds, spanning biofuels, biochemicals, bioplastics, and pharmaceuticals. These applications leverage the core advantage of cyanobacteria: their ability to fix atmospheric CO2 and convert solar energy into chemical energy, offering a pathway to decarbonize industry. The following sections detail several key case studies that illustrate the breadth and depth of current achievements, highlighting both the impressive results and the persistent challenges in scaling these processes to an industrial level.\n\nOne of the most prominent areas of research is the production of biofuels and renewable chemicals. Cyanobacteria have been engineered to synthesize a range of alcohols, hydrocarbons, and organic acids directly from CO2 and light [[10]]. For example, ethanol production has reached 5.5 g/L in *Synechocystis* sp. PCC 6803 [[9]], while sucrose and terpenoids have also been produced [[4]]. A notable success was demonstrated by a study engineering fast-growing *Synechococcus elongatus* strains for the phototrophic production of 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD), a versatile platform chemical. Using native promoters to avoid the cost of chemical inducers, the engineered strain IITB6_C achieved a productivity of 130 mg L−1 day−1, a record for any cyanobacterium under similar conditions [[11]]. In another case, CRISPRi was used to repress competing pathways in *Synechococcus elongatus* PCC 7942, leading to an 82% increase in succinic acid production and a final titer of 8.9 g/L after 32 days of continuous operation [[19]]. Even in pilot-scale trials, promising results have been seen; a mutant of *Synechocystis* sp. PCC 6714 produced 0.356 g L−1 PHB in a 40-L tubular photobioreactor, though this was significantly lower than lab-scale yields, underscoring scalability issues [[12]].\n\nThe production of bioplastics, particularly polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), represents another major application area. PHAs are fully biodegradable thermoplastics that can serve as a sustainable alternative to conventional petroleum-based plastics [[22]]. Cyanobacteria offer a significant advantage over heterotrophic bacteria, which are currently used for PHA production, by eliminating the need for costly organic carbon feedstocks [[22]]. The most studied strain for PHA production is *Synechocystis* sp. PCC 6803, but other strains like *Synechococcus* sp. and halotolerant *Synechocystis cf. salina* have also shown high accumulation capabilities [[22]]. Genetic engineering has focused on enhancing PHA content. Disrupting the *PirC* gene under nitrogen starvation increased PHA content from 29% to 49% of dry cell weight (dcw), while silencing the *sphU* gene boosted it 15-fold to 14.5% dcw [[22]]. Cultivation strategies are also being optimized, with wastewater from aquaculture and shrimp farming proving to be effective nutrient sources that can support high PHA accumulation (up to 80% dcw in *Aulosira fertilissima* and 32.5% in mutant *Synechocystis*) [[22]]. Despite these advances, the maximum reported productivity remains at 59 mg/L/d, far below the 810 mg/L/d required for economic competitiveness [[22]].\n\nThe pharmaceutical and nutraceutical sectors have also benefited from the unique chemistry of cyanobacteria. Many species produce secondary metabolites with potent biological activities, including pigments, vitamins, and peptides [[3,10]]. The edible filamentous cyanobacterium *Arthrospira platensis* (commonly known as Spirulina) is a globally consumed dietary supplement, with a projected market value of USD 779 million by 2026 [[5,21]]. Other commercially exploited compounds include β-carotene, which can constitute up to 13% of the dry biomass in *Dunaliella salina*, and astaxanthin, reaching 7% in *Haematococcus lacustris* [[21]]. Beyond bulk commodities, engineered cyanobacteria are being developed for advanced biomedical applications. Synthetic biology has enabled the creation of cells that can alleviate hypoxic microenvironments, promote wound healing, or act as delivery vehicles for drugs [[3]]. Furthermore, biosensors have been designed to detect heavy metals in the environment by coupling gene expression to bioluminescence or fluorescence, showcasing their utility in environmental monitoring [[9]]. The table below summarizes some representative examples of engineered cyanobacterial production.\n\n| Product Class | Target Compound | Engineered Strain(s) | Maximum Titer/Productivity | Key Findings and Context | Citations |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Biofuels** | Ethanol | *Synechocystis* sp.

Factors such as low titers, slow growth rates relative to heterotrophic hosts, high capital and operational costs, and challenges in maintaining stable cultures at scale all present significant hurdles that must be addressed to realize the full potential of these living factories [[4,9,12]].",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Despite the significant scientific progress and promising proof-of-concept demonstrations, the widespread commercialization of cyanobacterial biotechnology faces a formidable set of interconnected challenges. These barriers span the entire value chain, from cultivation and harvesting to genetic stability and regulatory frameworks. Acknowledging and systematically addressing these problems is critical for transitioning the field from academic curiosity to a robust, scalable, and economically competitive industry. The primary obstacles can be categorized into three main domains: technical/scalability limitations, economic viability constraints, and regulatory/harvesting hurdles.\n\nTechnical and scalability issues represent one of the most immediate sets of challenges. While many engineered strains exhibit desirable traits in controlled laboratory settings, their performance often degrades significantly when scaled up to pilot or industrial scales [[12]]. This phenomenon is driven by the difficulty of maintaining optimal growth conditions in large-volume reactors. Factors such as temperature fluctuations, pH shifts, and poor light penetration due to self-shading become pronounced, negatively impacting cell density and productivity [[5,12]]. Harvesting and downstream processing account for a substantial portion of total production costs, estimated at 20–30% [[21,22]]. The small cell size of many cyanobacteria makes separation energy-intensive, and conventional extraction solvents like chloroform pose environmental and health risks, necessitating the development of greener and more efficient recovery methods [[22]]. Furthermore, contamination by wild-type microbes or bacteriophages in open pond systems is a constant threat that can lead to complete crop failure, requiring stringent sterilization protocols that add to operational complexity and cost [[5]].\n\nEconomic viability is perhaps the most daunting barrier. The cost of producing biomass from cyanobacteria remains prohibitively high for many applications. Estimates place the price of dried biomass at €290 to €570 per kg, although scaling and professionalization could potentially reduce this to €43/kg [[5]]. For specific products like polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), the minimum selling price is estimated at 24 €/kg, which is still well above current market rates [[22]]. The high capital expenditure (CAPEX) for cultivation infrastructure, particularly photobioreactors (PBRs) which can cost between €10 and €5,000 per square meter, presents a major financial hurdle [[12]]. The cost of culture medium can be reduced by up to 95% by using wastewater as a nutrient source, but this introduces the risk of contaminating the final product with heavy metals or other pollutants, limiting its use to applications like biofuel production rather than food or pharmaceuticals [[5]]. Ultimately, for a product to be competitive, its cost must be justified by its value. For instance, PHA production must achieve a productivity of 810 mg/L/d to be competitive, a target that has not yet been met in practice [[22]].\n\nThe following table summarizes some of the key challenges and potential mitigation strategies discussed in the literature.\n\n| Challenge Category | Specific Problem | Magnitude of Issue | Proposed Mitigation Strategies | Citations |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Scalability** | Drop in productivity during scale-up | Pilot-scale PHB yield (0.365 g/L) vs. lab-scale (0.782 g/L). | Use of pre-adapted outdoor strains, optimization of reactor design (e.g., capillary PBRs). | [[12,22]] |\n| **Economics** | High capital and operating costs | CAPEX for PBRs: €10–€5000/m²; biomass cost: €290–€570/kg. | Use of wastewater, integration of phycoremediation, process intensification, AI-driven optimization. | [[5,9,12]] |\n| **Harvesting** | High energy and cost for separation | Accounts for 20–30% of total production cost. | Development of low-energy methods like flocculation; exploration of milking approaches for non-destructive extraction. | [[5,21,22]] |\n| **Genetic Stability** | Plasmid instability and polyploidy | Polyploidy complicates genetic segregation and stability in clonal lines. | Use of endogenous CRISPR systems for marker-less editing; development of stable chromosomal integration strategies. | [[8,10]] |\n| **Contamination** | Risk of infection in open ponds | Constant threat from wild-type competitors and bacteriophages. | Use of closed PBRs, selection of robust and fast-growing strains, implementation of strict sterilization protocols. | [[5]] |\n| **Regulatory** | Lack of clear regulatory pathways | EU Novel Food regulation since May 15, 1997, creates uncertainty for GM products. | Public education, transparent safety assessments, collaboration with regulatory bodies to establish clear guidelines. | [[5]] |\n\nFinally, there are significant regulatory and public acceptance hurdles. The use of genetically modified (GM) organisms is subject to strict regulations, such as the EU Novel Food regulation, which can create uncertainty and delay market entry for engineered products [[5]]. Ensuring biosafety, particularly preventing the unintended release of GM cyanobacteria into the environment, is a critical concern [[5]]. Public perception of GM foods and organisms can also be a barrier to adoption, requiring proactive communication and education to build trust [[5]]. Addressing these multifaceted challenges requires a concerted effort across multiple disciplines, from engineering and economics to policy and social sciences, to build a sustainable and socially acceptable framework for the next generation of cyanobacterial biotechnology.",

The journey from ancient pioneers of oxygenation to modern-day cell factories reveals a trajectory of increasing sophistication, driven by deepening knowledge of their biology and the relentless advancement of synthetic biology tools [[2,6]]. The core potential of cyanobacteria—to harness solar energy and atmospheric CO2 for the production of valuable goods—remains as compelling as ever. However, translating this potential into economic reality requires a strategic and holistic approach that addresses the entire production pipeline, from genetic design to industrial-scale implementation.\n\nThe future direction of the field is characterized by a move towards greater integration and systems-level thinking. The initial phase of metabolic engineering, which focused on adding a single heterologous pathway, is giving way to a more nuanced strategy of whole-genome optimization. This involves the precise tuning of hundreds of native genes to rebalance metabolic flux, enhance stress tolerance, and maximize product output. The continued development and application of CRISPR-based tools for simultaneous, multiplexed gene activation and repression will be central to this endeavor, allowing for the coordinated rewiring of entire cellular networks [[14,15,20]]. The synergy between wet-lab experimentation and computational modeling, using genome-scale metabolic models and artificial intelligence to guide design-build-test cycles, will accelerate the pace of innovation and improve the rationality of genetic modifications [[9,10]].\n\nFurthermore, the future lies in the intelligent integration of cyanobacterial bioproduction with existing industrial and agricultural systems. The concept of co-locating biorefineries with power plants or industrial facilities to capture waste CO2 and heat is a promising avenue for improving economic viability [[22]]. The use of municipal or agricultural wastewater not only reduces cultivation costs but also provides a solution for pollution remediation, turning a liability into a valuable resource [[5,12]]. This aligns perfectly with the principles of a circular bioeconomy. Additionally, research into novel cultivation systems, such as thin-layer cascades and capillary photobioreactors, which can achieve higher cell densities and better light utilization, may hold the key to overcoming the scalability bottleneck [[22]].\n\nHowever, the ultimate success of this field will depend not only on technological breakthroughs but also on navigating the complex socio-economic landscape. Economic analyses consistently highlight the need for dramatic reductions in production costs and increases in productivity to compete with conventional petrochemical routes [[5,22]]. This will require further innovation in materials science for lower-cost reactors, advances in low-energy harvesting and extraction technologies, and robust business models that can manage risk and secure investment [[12,21]]. Equally important is the need for clear and supportive regulatory frameworks that can foster innovation while ensuring safety and public trust [[5]].\n\nIn summary, the review of current potentials and applications of cyanobacteria reveals a field with immense promise but also significant hurdles. The foundational work in genomics and synthetic biology has provided the tools, and the proof-of-concept successes in producing a variety of valuable compounds have validated the approach. The path forward requires a concerted effort to bridge the gap between the lab and the factory floor. By focusing on integrated systems design, resource synergy, and cost-effective scalability, the scientific community can unlock the full potential of these remarkable photosynthetic organisms, paving the way for a more sustainable and resilient industrial future.\n\n---",
