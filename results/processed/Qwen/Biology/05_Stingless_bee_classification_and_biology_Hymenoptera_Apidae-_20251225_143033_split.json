      "content": "Stingless bees (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Meliponini) represent one of the most diverse and ecologically significant groups of insects on Earth. As a tribe of corbiculate bees, they play an indispensable role in the pollination of both wild flora and agricultural crops within tropical and subtropical ecosystems [[6,8]]. Their importance extends beyond ecology into cultural and economic spheres, where they are central to traditional practices like meliponiculture—the managed beekeeping for honey production and crop pollination—and provide vital ecosystem services that support biodiversity and food security [[6]]. Despite their profound impact, the classification, evolutionary history, and biological intricacies of stingless bees have been subjects of intense scientific scrutiny and revision. This review aims to synthesize the current state of knowledge concerning the classification and biology of the Meliponini, with a particular focus on integrating historical taxonomic frameworks with cutting-edge molecular phylogenetic data. By critically analyzing recent advancements, we seek to illuminate the profound shifts in understanding that have reshaped this field and to identify the critical challenges and future research directions that will define the next decade of stingless bee science.\n\nThe primary motivation for this review is to address a period of rapid and transformative change in Meliponini systematics, driven largely by the advent of high-throughput molecular techniques. For decades, classification was grounded in morphological characteristics, leading to groupings such as *Trigona s.l.* and *Plebeia s.l.*, which were later found to be polyphyletic upon molecular analysis [[7,9]]. These discoveries have created a complex landscape where foundational taxonomic concepts are being questioned and redefined. The objectives of this paper are threefold. First, we will trace the historical development of stingless bee classification, from early morphological descriptions to the era of molecular phylogenetics, highlighting key milestones and paradigm shifts. Second, we will present a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art methods, including the latest phylogenomic studies that have generated unprecedentedly robust phylogenetic trees. Third, and most importantly, we will use these modern phylogenetic frameworks to provide a synthesized view of the tribe's global diversity, updated classifications, and biogeographic history. We will also explore the rich and varied biology of these bees, examining their nesting behaviors, social structures, chemical communication, and emerging roles in microbial symbiosis. Through this synthesis, we aim to clarify the current taxonomic landscape, identify major gaps in our knowledge, and chart a course for future research that will further elucidate the fascinating world of these remarkable insects.",

      "content": "The systematic study of stingless bees has evolved through distinct eras, each defined by the prevailing technology and theoretical frameworks of its time. The foundations of modern classification were laid by pioneering taxonomists whose meticulous morphological descriptions established the initial framework for genus and species delineation. Charles D. Michener stands out as a seminal figure, authoring numerous works that became cornerstones of bee taxonomy [[1,14]]. His 1974 publication, *The Bees of the World*, provided a comprehensive overview of bee families, while his subsequent monographs on various genera offered detailed morphological diagnoses that formed the basis for nearly all subsequent work [[1]]. Similarly, Joaquim M. de Souza Moure, a prolific Brazilian entomologist, made foundational contributions to the taxonomy of Neotropical bees, particularly the genus *Melipona* [[13,14]]. His 1961 work on the Afrotropical fauna was a landmark contribution to that region's systematics [[3]]. These early efforts produced a classification system heavily reliant on visible anatomical traits, such as wing venation patterns, leg structure, and details of the male genitalia, which were considered stable and diagnostic.\n\nA pivotal moment in the history of Meliponini taxonomy was the widespread acceptance of the molecular phylogeny proposed by Rasmussen & Cameron in 2010 [[3,13]]. This study synthesized molecular data from multiple gene regions and decisively challenged long-held morphological groupings. It demonstrated that several traditionally recognized genera, such as the Old World *Trigona s.l.*, were polyphyletic, meaning they comprised species that did not share a common ancestor [[7,9]]. This finding triggered a wave of taxonomic revision aimed at creating monophyletic groups—groups that include all descendants of a single common ancestor. The Rasmussen & Cameron (2010) phylogeny became the new standard against which subsequent research was measured, guiding the work of many researchers who sought to refine and expand upon it [[1,13]]. This transition marked the definitive shift from a morphology-first to a phylogeny-informed approach to classification. Other key publications, such as those by Camargo & Pedro (2003) on the Neotropical genus *Partamona* [[1]] and Grüter (2020) on the broader classification of Meliponini [[6]], have continued this tradition of detailed taxonomic work that integrates morphological and molecular evidence.\n\nThe table below illustrates the evolution of classification systems and the key figures associated with them, highlighting the transition from descriptive taxonomy to a more phylogenetically rigorous approach.\n\n| Era | Key Figure(s) | Primary Methodology | Key Contribution(s) | Citation(s) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Foundational Morphology** | C.D. Michener, J.M. de Souza Moure | Detailed morphological description and comparison | Established foundational generic and subgeneric names; created comprehensive catalogs and keys for Neotropical and Afrotropical faunas. | [[1,13,14]] |\n| **Early Molecular Revolution** | Rasmussen & Cameron | Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequencing | Revealed the non-monophyly of large, traditional genera like *Trigona s.l.* and *Plebeia s.l.*, establishing a new phylogeny-based framework for classification. | [[3,7,9]] |\n| **Modern Phylogenomics** | Unnamed (PMID: 39414098) et al. | Ultraconserved Element (UCE) phylogenomics | Provided the most robust phylogenetic backbone to date, resolving deep nodes and incorporating previously unsampled taxa, solidifying the modern classification. | [[2,3]] |\n\nThis historical trajectory underscores a fundamental principle in systematics: scientific knowledge is progressive. While the foundational work of Michener and Moure remains invaluable, the integration of molecular data has proven essential for correcting historical inaccuracies and uncovering true evolutionary relationships. The current consensus is that a valid classification must reflect monophyly, a concept that can only be rigorously tested with genetic evidence. The ongoing work of researchers like Engel et al. (2023), who provide updated keys and classifications based on this new phylogenetic reality, represents the latest chapter in this continuing story of discovery [[4,15]].",

      "content": "The classification of Meliponini has entered an unprecedented era of precision, driven by the \"phylogenomic revolution\" that leverages massive-scale genomic data to resolve complex evolutionary histories. The state-of-the-art methodology now centers on the use of ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) and transcriptome data, which allow for the simultaneous analysis of thousands of loci across the genome [[2,3,10]]. This approach provides vastly greater statistical power than previous methods, which relied on a handful of genes and often struggled to confidently resolve relationships among rapidly diverging lineages. A landmark 2024 phylogenomic study exemplifies this new frontier, generating a dataset from over 2,500 UCE loci for 153 stingless bee species representing all known genera within the tribe [[2,3]]. This research represents the largest and most comprehensive phylogenomic matrix ever assembled for any group of bees, enabling it to confidently place even rare or poorly understood taxa, some of which had never been analyzed genetically before [[2]]. Critically, the study utilized \"museomics,\" a technique that allows for the extraction of DNA from precious museum specimens, thereby unlocking a vast repository of genetic information from historically collected material [[2,3]].\n\nThese advanced methods have yielded a remarkably robust phylogenetic tree that largely corroborates the broad outlines of the Rasmussen & Cameron (2010) topology but resolves many previously ambiguous nodes with high support [[3]]. The analyses consistently support the division of the tribe into three main, geographically structured lineages: Neotropical, Afrotropical, and an Indo-Australasian clade [[2]]. Within these major divisions, the phylogeny clarifies the relationships of numerous genera. For instance, it confirms the placement of the African genus *Hypotrigona* as the most basal lineage in the tribe, followed by the Australian genus *Austroplebeia* as its sister group [[9]]. This pattern suggests ancient vicariant events separating the Gondwanan landmasses played a crucial role in the early diversification of the tribe. The study also formally included first-time molecular data for several enigmatic genera, including *Camargoia*, *Paratrigonoides*, *Plectoplebeia*, *Cleptotrigona*, and several others from Australasia, providing a clearer picture of their positions within the family tree [[2]].\n\nHowever, the power of these methods also reveals areas of complexity and potential conflict. Gene-tree discordance was observed between concatenated species trees and coalescent-based analyses (weighted ASTRAL) for certain taxa, such as *Oxytrigona* and *Cephalotrigona* [[2]]. To address this, the researchers employed gene-genealogy interrogation (GGI), a powerful analytical method that tests for incongruence among individual gene trees. The results of this test supported a specific hypothesis that was more congruent with morphological evidence, underscoring the necessity of such topological testing to navigate the complexities of deep-time phylogenetics [[2]]. This highlights a key aspect of modern systematics: the interpretation of phylogenomic data requires sophisticated analytical tools and a nuanced understanding of the potential for conflicting signals within the genome. Furthermore, the integration of these massive datasets with other apid tribes has helped to solidify the position of Meliponini as a member of the corbiculate superfamily, confirming its close relationship with honey bees (Apini), bumble bees (Bombini), and orchid bees (Euglossini) [[10]]. This broader context is essential for understanding the independent origins of key traits, such as advanced eusociality, within different bee lineages [[4]].",

      "content": "The application of robust phylogenetic frameworks has led to significant revisions in the classification of Meliponini, resulting in a more accurate representation of the tribe's global diversity. As of 2023, the tribe comprises approximately 605 described species distributed across 45 genera [[4,15]]. This diversity is not evenly distributed, with the Neotropics hosting the vast majority of species (~80%, or 474 species), followed by the Indomalayan and Australasian regions (~16%, or 98 species), and the Afrotropical region (~5%, or 33 species) [[13,15]]. This geographical distribution reflects the ancient divergence of the major biogeographic lineages identified through phylogenetic analysis. The following table summarizes the current accepted classification for the major regional faunas, reflecting the modern understanding derived from recent phylogenomic and taxonomic studies [[2,3,15]].\n\n| Region | Key Genera and Subgenera | Notes on Classification | Citation(s) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Neotropics** | *Melipona* L., *Scaptotrigona* Moure, *Frieseomelitta* Moure, *Tetragonisca* Latreille, *Nannotrigona* Cockerell, *Lestrimelitta* Cockerell, *Partamona* Cockerell, *Trichotrigona* Cockerell, *Lepidotrigona* Cockerell, *Tetragonula* Moure, *Heterotrigona* Ducke, *Dolichotrigona* Moure, *Oxytrigona* Moure, *Cephalotrigona* Moure, *Cacoxenus* Cockerell (cleptoparasite), *Exoneura* Smith (cleptoparasite). | The Neotropical fauna is exceptionally diverse and contains the bulk of Meliponini species. The genus *Melipona* is a major radiation within this region. Recent phylogenies have clarified relationships within this clade, though some subgeneric status remains debated. | [[4,7,8,9]] |\n| **Afrotropics** | *Hypotrigona* Moure, *Meliponula* Moure, *Plebeina* Cockerell, *Melikerria* Moure, *Axestotrigona* Moure, *Plebeia* Latreille, *Mikatastavitzia* Moure, *Lestrimelitta* (also Neotropical). | The Afrotropical fauna is represented by four main clades. *Hypotrigona* is the most basal lineage in the entire tribe. *Meliponula* is the only remaining genus in the former *Trigonini*. The genus *Plebeia* also has a significant Neotropical radiation. | [[3,9,13]] |\n| **Indo-Malayan & Australasia** | *Trigona* Fabricius, *Tetragonula* Moure, *Lepidotrigona* Cockerell, *Heterotrigona* Ducke, *Austroplebeia* Moure, *Lispotrigona* V.H. Gonzalez & Engel, *Nanoplebeia* Engel, *Asperplebeia* Engel, *Anteplebeina* (subgenus of *Austroplebeia*), *Axestotrigona* (including subgenus *Atrichotrigona*), *Schwarziana* Moure (including subgenus *Chapadapis*). | This region includes two of the three main biogeographic clades. The genus *Trigona s.l.* is polyphyletic and has been split into several valid genera. The Australian fauna is particularly unique, with *Austroplebeia* as its main representative. | [[2,3,11,16]] |\n\nAn important aspect of this updated classification is the formal recognition of subgenera, which helps to organize the diversity within larger genera. For example, the Australian fossil bee *Atrichotrigona fujianica* was placed in a new subgenus, *Atrichotrigona*, of the genus *Axestotrigona* [[11]]. Similarly, a wealth of new subgeneric classifications has been proposed for Old World genera, including the creation of subgenera for *Axestotrigona* (*Atrichotrigona*), *Nannotrigona* (*Lispotrigona*), *Plebeia* (*Nanoplebeia*), and *Trigona* (*Aphaneuropsis*, *Koilotrigona*, *Necrotrigona*, etc.) [[11]]. These refinements provide a much more granular and accurate way to discuss the evolutionary relationships within these diverse groups. The classification is dynamic, with ongoing debates about the generic status of certain taxa, such as *Leurotrigona*, *Dolichotrigona*, and *Mourella*, which require further investigation [[13]]. Nonetheless, the overall framework is now firmly rooted in a well-supported phylogenetic backbone, providing a stable foundation for future biological and ecological research.",

      "content": "The biogeographic history of Meliponini is a compelling narrative of ancient continental drift and subsequent dispersal, shaped by millions of years of geological and climatic change. Phylogenetic analyses strongly support a tripartite division of the tribe corresponding to major geographic regions: the Neotropics, the Afrotropics, and the vast Indo-Malayan/Australasian realm [[2,3]]. This global pattern of distribution is best explained by vicariance, where the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana created permanent barriers between ancestral populations. The deepest split in the Meliponini phylogeny separates the Neotropical clade from a lineage composed of the Afrotropical and Indo-Australasian groups [[3]]. Further analysis places the African genus *Hypotrigona* as the earliest-diverging lineage within the tribe, sister to all other extant stingless bees [[9]]. This suggests that the tribe's origin was likely centered in Africa, with subsequent radiations occurring as Gondwana fragmented. The divergence times estimated from these phylogenies are consistent with this scenario, tracing the origins of the tribe back to the Upper Cretaceous period, between 66 and 95 million years ago [[4]].\n\nFossil evidence provides direct confirmation of this deep-time history and offers insights into the evolutionary pathways of the group. The oldest known fossil bee, *Cretotrigona prisca*, was discovered in Maastrichtian New Jersey amber and dates to approximately 66-95 million years ago, overlapping precisely with the estimated origin of the tribe [[13]]. More recently, a remarkable discovery of two new stingless bee species, *Tetragonula florilega* and *Austroplebeia fujianica*, was made in Middle Miocene (Langhian) amber from Zhangpu, China [[11]]. These fossils are particularly significant because neither *Tetragonula* nor *Austroplebeia* currently occur in East Asia, indicating that the distributions of these Old World genera were once much broader. This fossil record directly supports the idea of past connections between the Australasian and Asian regions, which have since been severed by tectonic activity. The association of the resin with extinct Dipterocarpaceae trees also suggests continuity in their ecological interactions, such as resin collection, from the Miocene to the present day [[11]].\n\nThe internal biogeography of the Neotropics itself tells a similar story of isolation and diversification. Studies of the widespread species *Nannotrigona perilampoides* in Mexico and Central America have revealed significant genetic and morphometric differentiation across the Sierra Madre mountain range [[12]]. This pattern of isolation by distance indicates that the mountain chain acts as a formidable biogeographical barrier, promoting the formation of distinct evolutionary units within the species. Such findings underscore how even relatively recent geological events can drive speciation and shape the contemporary biodiversity of the region. The combination of molecular phylogenetics, divergence dating, and paleontological evidence thus paints a comprehensive picture of Meliponini evolution. It reveals a history of ancient Gondwanan origins, subsequent vicariance-driven diversification across the globe, and ongoing adaptation and speciation within the major biogeographic realms, all documented and contextualized by the invaluable record preserved in amber fossils.",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Beyond their classification and evolutionary history, the biology of stingless bees is a rich area of study that reveals intricate adaptations to life in tropical and subtropical environments. One of the most striking aspects of their biology is the diversity of their nest architecture and construction materials. Unlike honey bees, which build combs of wax, stingless bees construct their nests using a variety of materials, primarily plant resins mixed with secretions from their own glands (cerumen) [[7]]. A molecular phylogeny of the genus *Trigona s.s.* successfully coded for fifteen different nest architectural and behavioral traits, revealing that many of these features have a strong phylogenetic signal [[7]]. For example, nesting substrate (e.g., hollow trees, rocks, soil), the presence of an external involucrum (a protective resin case around the nest), brood comb arrangement, and defensive behavior are all correlated with evolutionary history [[7]]. Ancestral state reconstruction suggests that the earliest *Trigona* species likely originated with cavity-nesting habits, building simple nests with horizontal brood combs and no internal partitions [[7]]. Some species, however, have evolved highly complex colonies. The giant-trigona species *Trigona (Megatrigoona) carbonaria* and *T. (Megatrigoona) gigas* are capable of constructing the largest known nests of any bee, with some *T. amazonensis* colonies reaching up to 3 meters in length and 1 meter in diameter [[7]].\n\nThe social structure of stingless bees is another area of intense research. Like their honey bee relatives, they exhibit advanced eusociality, characterized by cooperative brood care, overlapping generations, and a reproductive division of labor. However, their social organization can be more variable, with some species exhibiting haplodiploidy (where males develop from unfertilized eggs and females from fertilized ones) and others showing thelytokous parthenogenesis (where females produce female offspring without fertilization) [[4]]. Chemical communication is paramount in regulating colony dynamics. Worker mandibular gland secretions, for instance, contain pheromones that influence queen development and worker behavior. In some species, workers also possess penicilli—long setae on their hind tibia—which may serve as a specialized scent-marking device to communicate with nestmates [[13,14]]. The precise function of these structures continues to be an active area of investigation.\n\nA particularly exciting and emerging field of research is the study of microbial symbioses within stingless bee colonies. Recent work has shown that microbes play a crucial role in the development and health of brood [[1]]. These symbiotic relationships are likely ancient and fundamental to the success of the tribe, influencing everything from nutrition to disease resistance. While still in its infancy, this area of research promises to reveal a hidden dimension of stingless bee biology, connecting their macroscopic behaviors and anatomy to the microscopic world of microorganisms. Understanding these symbioses could have profound implications for managing these bees in agriculture and for conservation efforts, as disruptions to these microbial communities could impact colony health. This nascent field represents a frontier in Meliponini biology, poised to deepen our appreciation for the complex ecological networks within which these bees exist.",

      "content": "Despite the immense progress fueled by phylogenomics, the field of stingless bee systematics and biology faces several significant challenges and open problems that demand focused research attention. Perhaps the most pressing issue is the severe taxonomic impediment, particularly concerning the Afrotropical fauna. While the Neotropical region benefits from a relatively robust phylogenetic framework and a growing body of genomic data, the same cannot be said for Africa [[4]]. There is a conspicuous lack of genomic resources for Afrotropical genera, which creates a major gap in our ability to perform comparative genomics and fully understand the continent's unique evolutionary history. Addressing this disparity is a critical priority, as it limits our capacity to conduct meaningful global analyses of trait evolution, biogeography, and adaptation within the tribe.\n\nAnother major challenge lies in resolving contentious taxonomic issues. Even with the clarity provided by phylogenomics, some questions remain unresolved. Disagreements persist regarding the generic status of certain species complexes, such as *Leurotrigona*, *Dolichotrigona*, and *Mourella*, which may require integrative approaches combining molecular, morphological, and ecological data to achieve a final resolution [[13]]. Furthermore, the phenomenon of taxonomic homoplasy—where different species evolve similar morphologies independently—continues to complicate classification. The nomenclatural confusion surrounding *Scaptotrigona depilis*, where public databases list two non-sister taxa under the same name, highlights the urgent need for careful, integrative taxonomic revisions to stabilize scientific names and ensure data integrity [[4]]. The development of comprehensive, online identification tools that incorporate both morphological and molecular data will be essential for addressing this problem at a global scale.\n\nLooking forward, the future of stingless bee research appears to lie at the intersection of genomics, functional biology, and ecology. The generation of high-quality reference genomes for additional species, especially representatives from under-sampled regions like Africa and Southeast Asia, is a key objective. Comparative genomic studies can shed light on the genetic basis of adaptive traits, such as the vestigial sting apparatus, the ability to collect different types of resin, and the various forms of social organization. The exploration of microbial symbiosis offers another fertile ground for future research. Investigating the functional roles of gut microbiota and other symbionts in brood development, nutrition, and immunity could unlock novel strategies for improving colony health and resilience, which is increasingly important in the face of environmental change [[1]]. Finally, there is a need to translate the findings of basic research into applied solutions. This includes refining meliponiculture practices to preserve local genetic diversity, developing sustainable pollination programs for crops, and implementing effective conservation strategies to protect these vital yet vulnerable pollinators. By tackling these challenges, the scientific community can ensure that the momentum gained from the phylogenomic revolution translates into a deeper understanding and more effective stewardship of the world's stingless bees.\n\n---",
