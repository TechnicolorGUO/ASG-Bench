      "content": "The study of infectious diseases has long relied on animal models and two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures to dissect the complex interplay between pathogens and their hosts. While these systems have provided invaluable insights, they are increasingly recognized as having significant limitations in predicting human pathophysiology due to interspecies differences and the failure of 2D monolayers to recapitulate the structural and functional complexity of native tissues. This translational gap has driven the search for more physiologically relevant platforms. In this context, organoid technology has emerged as a transformative approach in infection biology, offering a unique bridge between traditional models and clinical reality. Organoids are three-dimensional (3D) multicellular structures derived from stem cells or tissue-specific progenitors that can self-organize and differentiate to mimic the architecture, function, and genetic identity of their parent organs [[2,6]]. Their ability to be generated from patient-derived material endows them with a level of human relevance and genetic fidelity that is unparalleled by conventional methods, making them powerful tools for modeling host-pathogen interactions [[2,21]].\n\nThe motivation for employing organoids in infection studies stems from their capacity to overcome key shortcomings of existing models. Unlike transformed cell lines such as Vero cells, which are often used for virus propagation but lack the differentiated cell types and physiological barriers of primary human tissue, organoids contain a diverse array of cell lineages found in vivo, including secretory cells, absorptive enterocytes, and Paneth cells [[1,29]]. This cellular heterogeneity is critical for studying pathogens with specific tropisms. For instance, intestinal organoids were instrumental in establishing that SARS-CoV-2 enters through enterocytes expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2, a finding that was not fully appreciated in less relevant models and helped explain gastrointestinal symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients [[9,12]]. Furthermore, organoids can be grown from adult stem cells (ASCs) or reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), allowing for the creation of patient-specific models that reflect individual genetic susceptibilities, such as mutations in *fucosyltransferase 2* that confer resistance to norovirus infection [[1,2]]. This capability is foundational to the field of personalized medicine, enabling tailored therapeutic strategies based on an individual's unique response to pathogens.\n\nThis review provides a comprehensive systematic analysis of the current state-of-the-art methods for using organoids as host models for infection biology. It examines the historical development that laid the groundwork for modern applications, details the core techniques for organoid generation and maintenance, and explores the sophisticated approaches now being used to interrogate pathogenesis. The review critically assesses the strengths of this platform while providing a transparent account of its inherent challenges and open problems. Finally, it looks toward the future, identifying emerging trends and research directions that will shape the next generation of organoid-based infection studies. By synthesizing information across numerous pathogens—from coronaviruses and arboviruses to enteric bacteria and parasites—this paper aims to serve as a definitive resource for researchers seeking to leverage organoids for understanding and combating infectious disease.",

      "content": "The foundation of modern organoid technology rests on a clear definition and a series of pivotal scientific discoveries. An organoid is fundamentally a 3D culture derived from stem cells that exhibits self-organization and can replicate the in vivo-like functions of a specific organ [[1]]. These models can be broadly categorized into two main sources: adult stem cell (ASC)-derived organoids and pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived organoids, which include both embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [[1,2]]. ASC-derived organoids are typically established from small biopsies of tissue and are propagated by culturing isolated stem cells in a supportive 3D matrix [[3]]. They are prized for their high expansion potential, rapid establishment, and genetic stability, making them ideal for generating patient-derived models [[1]]. PSC-derived organoids, in contrast, are generated from cells with the potential to differentiate into any cell type in the body. This allows for the creation of cerebral organoids that model neurodevelopmental processes, a feat impossible with ASCs [[2,16]]. However, PSC-derived organoids often face challenges with maturation and reproducibility, requiring more complex protocols to guide differentiation [[2,6]]. A wide array of organoid types has been developed for infection biology, including gastrointestinal, lung, brain, liver, kidney, bladder, and female reproductive tract organoids, each tailored to study specific pathogens like Zika virus, SARS-CoV-2, *Helicobacter pylori*, and norovirus [[1,2,21]].\n\nThe journey to creating these sophisticated models began with seminal work in developmental biology and stem cell research. The first published study to describe organoids, by Sato et al. in 2009, demonstrated that single Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells could form crypt-villus structures when cultured in a cytokine-rich matrix, marking a foundational milestone [[4,11]]. This breakthrough was quickly followed by the development of robust protocols for growing intestinal organoids (also known as enteroids) from adult stem cells in 2011 [[2]]. This work provided the essential methodological framework later applied to countless infection studies. The first direct application of organoids to model host-pathogen interaction was published in 2012 by Finkbeiner et al., who used human intestinal organoids to successfully model rotavirus infection, validating the new system's utility for virology [[4]]. Another critical early advance came in 2016 with the work of Ettayebi et al., who achieved the first ex vivo replication of human norovirus in intestinal enteroids, a major hurdle given the virus's inability to grow in standard cell lines [[2]]. Similarly, Heo et al. established a culture system using human intestinal organoids to support the complete life cycle of *Cryptosporidium parvum*, another parasite that had defied cultivation outside a host [[2]]. Perhaps one of the most impactful early applications was in neurovirology; cerebral organoids were used to demonstrate that Zika virus preferentially targets neural progenitor cells, providing crucial mechanistic insight into the virus's role in causing microcephaly [[2]]<URLQian et al., 2016><URLGarcez et al., 2016>. These landmark studies collectively established the organoid platform as a versatile and indispensable tool for tackling previously intractable questions in infection biology.",

      "content": "The successful application of organoids in infection biology relies on a sophisticated suite of methodologies encompassing their generation, maintenance, pathogen delivery, and downstream analysis. The process begins with the isolation of stem cells from source tissue. For ASC-derived organoids, this involves obtaining small tissue biopsies, which are then digested using enzymes like type IV collagenase to release the stem cells [[3]]. Digestion times vary by tissue origin, with gastrointestinal tissues requiring approximately one hour, while liver tissue may only need 30 minutes [[3]]. Following digestion, the cells are resuspended in a growth factor-replete medium and embedded in a 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold, most commonly Matrigel®, an Engelbreth–Holm–Swarm (EHS) matrix rich in laminin, collagen IV, and other proteins that mimics the basement membrane [[1,3,9]]. The organoids are then cultured in a specialized medium containing a cocktail of morphogens, such as R-spondin 1, Noggin, and Wnt3a, which are essential for maintaining stemness and promoting self-renewal and differentiation [[2,15]]. Culture conditions must be carefully controlled, with standardized lab environments ranging from grade D+A cleanliness for basic research to B+A for therapeutic production [[3]].\n\nPathogen delivery is a critical step where various techniques are employed depending on the organoid type and the nature of the study. The foundational method is apical microinjection, where a precise volume of pathogen solution is introduced directly into the lumen of the organoid [[1]]. This technique is highly efficient and was first used to infect organoids with *Helicobacter pylori*, *Clostridioides difficile*, and viruses like Zika and SARS-CoV-2 [[1]]. A skilled researcher can microinject 100–200 organoids in just 5–10 minutes [[1]]. An alternative approach is basal/apical-out inversion, where organoids are dissociated and re-plated on a filter insert, allowing for basolateral infection, which is relevant for pathogens that target the underside of epithelial layers [[2]]. Another common method involves infecting organoids during routine passaging, where disaggregated organoid cells are mixed with the pathogen before being re-embedded in fresh Matrigel [[1]]. To facilitate high-throughput screening, organoids can be differentiated into organoid-derived monolayers (ODMs) on transwell filters [[2]]. These 2D-like sheets of polarized epithelial cells maintain tight junctions, forming a barrier that can be assessed for integrity via transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements, making them suitable for drug testing and studying barrier disruption by pathogens [[10]].\n\nThe choice of ECM is a significant consideration. While Matrigel remains the gold standard, its composition is undefined and varies between batches, leading to inconsistencies in organoid growth and experimental outcomes [[1,9]]. Efforts to develop defined, synthetic hydrogels like EKGel and HELP (hyaluronan elastin-like protein) aim to improve reproducibility and control over matrix properties such as stiffness and ligand concentration [[9]]. Once infected, a wide range of readouts is available to quantify the outcome. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy provide visual confirmation of viral entry, replication, and cellular damage [[2]]. Flow cytometry can be used to analyze cell surface markers or intracellular viral antigens [[2]]. Molecular techniques are central to quantitative analysis, with quantitative PCR (qPCR) frequently used to measure viral RNA levels or gene expression changes [[19]]. Transcriptomics, including bulk RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), offer deep insights into host responses at the genome-wide level [[2,15,19]]. For example, scRNA-seq has been used to compare organoid gene expression profiles to in vivo datasets, confirming the conservation of host factor expression [[19]]. Other advanced techniques include ATAC-seq to probe chromatin accessibility and CUT&RUN-seq for high-resolution mapping of histone modifications, providing multi-layered views of host-pathogen interactions [[15]].\n\n| Methodological Step | Common Techniques | Purpose / Application | Representative Sources |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Stem Cell Isolation** | Enzymatic Digestion (Collagenase, Hyaluronidase) | Release of stem/progenitor cells from tissue biopsies. | `[[3]]` |\n| **Organoid Culture** | Embedding in Matrigel®/Synthetic Hydrogels | 3D growth and self-organization supported by ECM. | `[[1]]`, `[[9]]` |\n| | Defined Media (Wnt, R-spondin, Noggin) | Maintenance of stem cell identity and directed differentiation. | `[[2]]`, `[[15]]` |\n| **Pathogen Delivery** | Apical Microinjection | Precise delivery of pathogens into the organoid lumen. | `[[1]]` |\n| | Basolateral/Inverted Infection | Infection of the abluminal surface, mimicking certain infections. | `[[2]]` |\n| | Infection During Passaging | Mixing disaggregated cells with pathogen before re-embedding. | `[[1]]` |\n| **Differentiation to Monolayer** | Seeding on Transwell Filters | Creation of 2D polarized epithelial layers for TEER and drug screens. | `[[2]]`, `[[10]]` |\n| **Infection Readouts** | qPCR | Quantification of viral replication and host gene expression. | `[[19]]`, `[[18]]` |\n| | Immunofluorescence/Electron Microscopy | Visualization of pathogen localization and cellular pathology. | `[[2]]` |\n| | Transcriptomics (RNA-seq) | Genome-wide analysis of host transcriptional response. | `[[2]]`, `[[15]]` |\n| | Single-cell Analysis (scRNA-seq) | Dissection of heterogeneous host responses at the single-cell level. | `[[19]]`, `[[7]]` |",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "A significant evolution in organoid technology has been the shift from static, single-cell-type cultures towards dynamic, multi-cellular co-culture systems that better mimic the complexity of in vivo tissues. The integration of immune cells is paramount for studying host-pathogen interactions, as the immune response is often the primary determinant of disease outcome. Various co-culture models have been developed to incorporate different components of the immune system. One of the most straightforward approaches involves adding immune cells to the culture medium. Studies have successfully co-cultured intestinal organoids with neutrophils, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), and autologous T cells to investigate mucosal immunity and inflammatory bowel disease [[1,9,11]]. Macrophage-augmented intestinal organoids (MaugOs) represent a more advanced model, integrating human macrophages derived from THP-1 monocytes or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with primary intestinal organoids [[30]]. This system supports productive infection by multiple enteric viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and rotavirus, and importantly, recapitulates key aspects of the host inflammatory response, such as IL-1β production via NLRP3 inflammasome activation [[30]]. A microwell-based co-culture system using mouse intestinal organoids and RAW 264.7 macrophages demonstrated that TNF-α secretion from macrophages induces morphological changes in organoids, highlighting the power of these models to study immune-organoid crosstalk [[29]].\n\nBeyond myeloid cells, some organoid types inherently contain resident immune populations. Tonsillar organoids, for example, retain intrinsic B, T, and dendritic cells, making them an excellent model for studying HIV transmission and germinal center responses [[2,4]]. Similarly, airway organoids can be co-cultured with immune cells to model respiratory tract infections [[28]]. The ultimate goal is to create homeostatic dynamics and de novo immune memory within these engineered tissues, enabling higher-throughput studies of human immune biology [[5]]. However, a major limitation in many models remains the absence of a fully functional vascular system and a competent adaptive immune system, particularly microglia in brain organoids, which limits their ability to model systemic immunity [[7,11]]. Future work will focus on integrating vascular endothelial cells and lymphatic cells to create more complete, perfused organ-on-a-chip systems that can better simulate the circulatory environment [[9,21]].\n\nThe study of host factors—the cellular proteins that pathogens exploit for entry, replication, and spread—is another cornerstone of modern infection biology. Organoids have become an exceptionally powerful platform for identifying these critical dependencies. The advent of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing has revolutionized this area, enabling large-scale, unbiased genetic screens [[16,25]]. Pooled CRISPR knockout (KO) screens involve delivering a library of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting thousands of genes into a population of organoids [[13,25]]. After selection pressure from pathogen infection, sgRNAs corresponding to essential host genes are depleted, while those targeting non-essential genes remain. Deep sequencing identifies the enriched sgRNAs, pinpointing the genes required for infection [[25]]. This approach has been used extensively to identify host factors for coronaviruses, dengue virus, and influenza virus [[17,18,20]]. For instance, a screen in human intestinal organoids confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 entry requires the receptor ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2, but not endosomal cathepsins, resolving conflicting data from other cell types and explaining the clinical failure of cathepsin inhibitors [[12,19]].\n\nTo further enhance precision, researchers are developing more refined CRISPR tools. Base editors (BEs) and prime editors allow for single-base changes or small insertions/deletions without inducing double-strand breaks, reducing off-target effects and increasing efficiency for correcting point mutations associated with disease [[16,22]]. In addition to forward genetic screens, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) uses a catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) fused to a repressor domain to silence gene expression, allowing for the identification of host dependency factors [[25]]. The combination of these advanced genetic tools with organoid models provides a uniquely powerful system for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of infection. Screens conducted in organoids are yielding novel therapeutic targets, such as the discovery that the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex member *SMARCA4* is a pro-viral host factor for multiple coronaviruses [[26]]. The results from these screens can be validated using targeted CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to create mutant organoid lines, as was done to generate a biobank of coronavirus host-factor knockouts for functional validation [[12,19]]. This synergy between CRISPR technology and organoid biology is rapidly advancing our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and accelerating the discovery of host-directed antiviral therapies.",

      "content": "The versatility of organoid technology has led to its widespread adoption across a vast spectrum of infection biology research, with successful applications in nearly every major organ system and for a diverse range of pathogens. In the gastrointestinal tract, intestinal and colon organoids have become a workhorse for studying enteric viruses and bacteria. The first ex vivo replication of human norovirus and the complete life cycle of *Cryptosporidium* were groundbreaking achievements made possible by intestinal enteroids [[2]]. More recently, colon organoids have been used as a drug screening platform for SARS-CoV-2, identifying compounds like imatinib that reduce viral infection [[9]]. Airway organoids, including bronchial and alveolar models, are critical for investigating respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and seasonal coronaviruses, allowing researchers to study viral tropism and evaluate antiviral therapies in a human-relevant context [[4,28]]. In the nervous system, cerebral organoids have been instrumental in modeling the devastating effects of neurotropic viruses. They were used to demonstrate how Zika virus infection disrupts neurogenesis and leads to microcephaly by targeting neural progenitor cells [[2]]<URLQian et al., 2016>. Cerebral organoids have also been used to study Japanese encephalitis virus and La Crosse virus [[7]].\n\nThe table below summarizes key applications of organoids in infection biology, highlighting the organ system, the pathogen(s), and the primary findings or contributions of the research.\n\n| Organ System | Organoid Type | Pathogen(s) | Key Findings & Contributions | Representative Sources |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Gastrointestinal Tract** | Intestinal Enteroids/Colon Organoids | Norovirus, Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, C. difficile, Rotavirus, Echovirus, SARS-CoV-2 | First ex vivo replication of norovirus; full lifecycle of *Cryptosporidium*; identified enterocytes as susceptible SARS-CoV-2 cells; drug screening. | `[[2]]`, `[[1]]`, `[[9]]`, `[[30]]` |\n| **Respiratory System** | Airway/Lung Organoids | SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, MERS-CoV, Coronaviruses, MPXV, EBOLAV | Modeled multi-organ tropism of SARS-CoV-2; evaluated vaccine responses; studied viral entry pathways; co-cultured with tonsil organoids. | `[[21]]`, `[[4]]`, `[[28]]`, `[[1]]` |\n| **Nervous System** | Cerebral Organoids | Zika Virus, JEV, LACV, HSV | Mechanistically linked Zika virus to microcephaly by targeting neural progenitors; modeled other arbovirus infections; encephalitis. | `[[2]]`, `<URLQian et al., 2016>`, `[[7]]`, `[[4]]` |\n| **Liver** | Liver Organoids | Hepatitis B/C/E Virus (HBV/HCV/HEV), Dengue, SARS-CoV-2 | Supported the full lifecycles of hepatitis viruses; identified host factors for dengue virus; demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 replication. | `[[4]]`, `[[3]]`, `[[21]]`, `[[18]]` |\n| **Kidney** | Kidney Organoids | SARS-CoV-2 | Showed increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 under diabetic conditions; expression of key entry factors. | `[[21]]` |\n| **Female Reproductive Tract** | Ectocervical Organoids | HPV | Simulated co-infections and viral reservoirs. | `[[4]]` |\n| **Skin** | Skin Organoids | MPXV | Modelled rash and gastrointestinal symptoms of monkeypox virus. | `[[4]]` |\n| **Immune System** | Tonsil Organoids | HIV, Influenza | Revealed mechanisms of T-cell dysfunction; evaluated vaccine responses; contained intrinsic immune populations. | `[[4]]`, `[[2]]` |\n\nBeyond these examples, organoids from other tissues have also provided novel insights. Gastric organoids have been used to study *Helicobacter pylori* infection and the induction of oncogenic pathways [[1,3]]. Liver organoids have enabled the study of hepatitis B, C, and E virus lifecycles, which are exclusive to humans, and have been used to identify host factors for dengue virus [[3,4,21]]. Vascular organoids have been used to identify CCZ1 as a key host factor for Ebola virus [[4]]. Even ectocervical organoids have been developed to model HPV co-infections, providing a more realistic model of sexually transmitted infections [[4]]. The skin organoid model has been adapted to study the pathogenesis of monkeypox virus, replicating characteristic rashes and GI symptoms [[4]]. These diverse applications underscore the broad utility of organoids as a platform for fundamental discovery and translational research in infectious disease.",

      "heading": "Critical Assessment: Challenges, Open Problems, and Future Directions",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Despite the immense promise and rapid advancements in organoid technology, the field faces significant challenges and open problems that must be addressed to unlock its full potential. A primary obstacle is the lack of standardization across laboratories [[1,4]]. This manifests in several ways. First, the use of undefined, animal-derived components like Matrigel introduces batch-to-batch variability, compromising reproducibility [[1,9]]. While synthetic hydrogels offer a more defined alternative, they are not yet universally adopted [[9]]. Second, protocols for organoid generation, passaging, and differentiation vary widely, making direct comparisons of results difficult [[2,4]]. This issue has prompted initiatives aimed at establishing consensus standards, such as the work of ISO/TC 276 and national bodies in China that have issued guidelines for organoid culture [[3]]. Third, readout metrics are not uniform, with different labs using different methods to quantify infection or assess organoid health [[7,8]].\n\nAnother profound challenge lies in the incomplete physiological maturity of organoids. Many PSC-derived organoids, particularly those from the brain and intestine, exhibit an immature phenotype compared to their in vivo counterparts [[2,6]]. This immaturity is reflected in their transcriptomes and functional capacities, which can limit their utility for studying chronic diseases or age-related susceptibility [[2]]. Strategies to overcome this include co-culturing with stromal or immune cells, which can promote maturation, and optimizing culture conditions to extend culture duration [[1,5]]. A related issue is the absence of a functional vasculature and lymphatic system in most organoid models [[7,11]]. Without a blood supply, organoids are limited in size and cannot fully simulate nutrient/waste exchange or the migration of circulating immune cells. While vascularized organoids-on-a-chip are being developed, this remains a frontier area of research [[9,21]].\n\nFurthermore, the immunodeficient nature of many organoid models is a critical limitation. The lack of a mature, integrated immune microenvironment means that organoids primarily capture the intrinsic cellular response to a pathogen, rather than the full orchestration of the innate and adaptive immune systems [[4,7]]. While progress is being made in co-culturing with immune cells, these models often lack key players like microglia for brain organoids or a functional thymus for generating a diverse T-cell repertoire [[5,7]]. This shortcoming is a major reason why organoid-based drug screens, despite showing great promise, have not yet seen widespread clinical adoption. As of 2021, fewer than 20,000 patients annually received organoid-based screening, a tiny fraction of the ~20 million new cancer cases diagnosed worldwide each year [[9]]. The industry revenue from organoid technology is similarly low, suggesting a significant translational bottleneck [[9]].\n\nLooking to the future, several key research directions are poised to address these challenges. The continued development of \"human-on-a-chip\" or multi-organoid systems, connected by microfluidic channels to simulate inter-organ communication and drug metabolism, represents a major step towards creating more holistic biological models [[1,2]]. Advancements in bioprinting will enable the construction of more complex, spatially organized tissues that integrate epithelial, stromal, immune, and vascular components [[1,6]]. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning with high-content imaging and multi-omics data from organoids will allow for the creation of predictive computational models that can simulate pathogenesis and predict drug efficacy [[6]]. Finally, the refinement of CRISPR technologies, such as prime editing and base editing, combined with improved delivery systems, will enhance the precision of genetic engineering in organoids, enabling more accurate modeling of complex genetic diseases and their interaction with pathogens [[16,22]]. Overcoming these hurdles will be essential for realizing the ultimate vision of organoids as a cornerstone of personalized medicine and a reliable preclinical testing platform for infectious diseases.\n\n---",
