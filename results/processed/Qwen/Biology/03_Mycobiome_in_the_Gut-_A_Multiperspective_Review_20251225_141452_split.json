      "content": "The human gut microbiome, a complex ecosystem of trillions of microorganisms, has been the subject of intense scientific scrutiny for decades. While much of this research has focused on bacteria, a parallel but less explored community of fungi constitutes the gut mycobiome. This fungal component, though numerically minor, plays a disproportionately significant role in host health and disease. The term \"mycobiome\" was first formally introduced by Ghannoum and colleagues in 2010 to describe these resident and transient fungal communities within the human body [[3]]. Fungi are estimated to represent approximately 0.1% of the total microbial population in the gut, a fraction that belies their ecological importance [[3,7,10]]. Despite their low abundance, fungi possess larger cell sizes and greater surface-area-to-volume ratios compared to bacteria, which facilitates distinct and potent interactions with the host immune system and other microbes [[2]]. These interactions can modulate inflammation, influence the assembly of the bacterial microbiome, and contribute to the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, from inflammatory bowel disorders to neurological conditions.\n\nThe composition of the healthy adult gut mycobiome is dominated by a few key phyla. Ascomycota is consistently identified as the most prevalent, followed by Basidiomycota [[3,7]]. Other phyla such as Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota are also present [[7]]. Prevailing genera include *Saccharomyces*, *Candida*, *Malassezia*, *Cladosporium*, and *Aspergillus* [[3,6,7]]. Among these, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (brewer's/baker's yeast) is one of the most frequently detected species, found in as many as 89% of healthy individuals, while *Candida albicans* is a common colonizer [[7,10]]. However, it is crucial to recognize that the line between commensal and pathogen is often blurred for many fungal species. For instance, *C. albicans*, a well-known opportunistic pathogen, is also a normal inhabitant of the gut in healthy individuals [[3]]. Its systemic spread to other organs is widely believed to originate from this gut reservoir [[3]]. Similarly, *S. cerevisiae* is used in probiotic supplements like *Saccharomyces boulardii*, yet it has also been implicated in fungemia under certain circumstances [[6]]. This dual nature underscores the critical importance of understanding not just the identity of fungi, but their relative abundances and functional states within the context of the entire gut ecosystem.\n\nThe motivation for this comprehensive review stems from the rapid expansion of knowledge in this field, driven by advances in molecular biology and computational science. Initially considered a passive or even insignificant component of the microbiome, the mycobiome is now recognized as an active participant in interkingdom communication and a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for a wide array of human ailments. The dysbiosis, or imbalance, of the gut mycobiome has been linked to a staggering number of conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer (CRC), liver cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes, multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease, and severe COVID-19 [[3,6,7]]. Understanding the mechanisms behind these associations requires a multiperspective approach that integrates ecology, immunology, clinical medicine, and advanced technology. This review aims to synthesize the current state of knowledge across these domains. It will explore the historical development of mycobiome research, dissect the methodological tools and challenges that define the field, analyze the evidence linking the mycobiome to health and disease, identify critical gaps in our understanding, and chart a course for future investigation. By synthesizing findings from foundational studies to cutting-edge multi-omics analyses, this review provides a holistic perspective on the gut mycobiome, its profound impact on human biology, and its immense potential for improving health outcomes.",

      "content": "The study of the human mycobiome has evolved dramatically from rudimentary observations to sophisticated, high-throughput investigations. The earliest insights into neonatal colonization were provided by Nagata et al. in 2012, who conducted a landmark peer-reviewed molecular analysis demonstrating vertical transmission of the fungus *Malassezia* from mothers to their newborns immediately after birth [[9,11]]. This work established a fundamental principle: the initial establishment of the infant mycobiome is heavily influenced by maternal transfer. This finding was expanded upon significantly by Schei et al., whose large-scale study of 298 mother-infant pairs utilized high-throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region to characterize the maturation of the infant gut mycobiota over the first two years of life [[9,11]]. Their research revealed a clear temporal trajectory, where meconium samples were dominated by *Candida*, shifting to *Malassezia* at six months, and eventually to *Trichosporon* in vaginally delivered infants or *Saccharomyces* in Cesarean-born infants by 18 months [[3,8]]. This work highlighted the profound influence of delivery mode on the nascent mycobiome and underscored the need for longitudinal studies to understand developmental dynamics.\n\nThe conceptual framework for modern mycobiome research solidified with the publication of Ghannoum et al. in 2010, which formally coined the term \"human mycobiome\" to describe the fungal communities inhabiting human niches, initially focusing on the oral cavity [[3]]. Around the same time, the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) began its seminal work, contributing foundational data on the gut mycobiome through ITS sequencing, although it placed a greater emphasis on the bacterial component [[10]]. A pivotal moment came in 2013 when Hoffmann et al. published a large-scale characterization of the gut mycobiome using deep sequencing of the ITS1 region from 98 healthy individuals [[10]]. This study identified 66 fungal genera and 184 species, establishing baseline profiles and revealing correlations between specific fungal and bacterial taxa, suggesting complex syntrophic relationships influenced by diet [[10]].\n\nPerhaps the most transformative milestone in the field was the 2012 paper by Iliyan D. Iliev and colleagues published in *Science*. This study demonstrated that the mammalian gut contains stable fungal communities that interact directly with the host immune system via the pattern recognition receptor Dectin-1 [[10,12]]. This discovery was revolutionary because it provided a direct mechanistic link between the presence of fungi and host immunity, establishing the mycobiome as an active regulator of health rather than a mere passenger. It shifted the focus of research towards understanding how the immune system recognizes and responds to fungi and how this process goes awry in disease. Following this, the scientific consensus solidified around the ITS region as the official fungal barcode for DNA barcoding in 2012 [[12]], providing a standardized target for molecular analysis and enabling more comparable studies across different laboratories and platforms. More recently, a genomic compendium of 760 cultivated human gut fungi (CGF) was assembled, representing 206 species and providing invaluable resources for functional genomics and metabolic modeling [[14]]. This collection, along with curated databases like UNITE, forms the backbone of modern taxonomic classification and has enabled deeper insights into the phylogeny-dependent functions of gut fungi [[11,14]]. The collective progress since these early milestones illustrates a field maturing from descriptive taxonomy to a mechanistically-driven discipline capable of exploring complex interkingdom interactions and their clinical relevance.",

      "content": "The accurate characterization of the gut mycobiome relies on a suite of advanced methodologies that have evolved to overcome significant technical hurdles. At the heart of culture-independent analysis is next-generation sequencing (NGS), primarily targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the ribosomal RNA operon as the standard fungal barcode [[9,12]]. Both the ITS1 and ITS2 regions are commonly used, but they exhibit different amplification biases; primers for ITS1 tend to favor Basidiomycetes, whereas ITS2/ITS4 are better at amplifying Ascomycetes [[7]]. An alternative marker is the 18S rRNA gene, which provides better resolution at higher taxonomic levels but lacks the fine-grained genus-level specificity of the ITS regions [[2]]. The choice of primer set is therefore a critical experimental design decision that can profoundly influence the resulting data, with several studies reporting that some sets fail entirely to amplify DNA from certain fungal groups [[1,5]]. To circumvent these issues, emerging technologies like PacBio and Oxford Nanopore offer full-length rRNA operon sequencing, which can span both ITS1 and ITS2 regions, thereby avoiding primer bias and significantly improving taxonomic resolution, especially for organisms with unusually long ITS sequences [[9,15]].\n\nBeyond sequencing targets, sample preparation presents another major challenge. Fungal cell walls are notoriously robust, composed of β-1,3-glucan, mannans, and glycoproteins, making them resistant to lysis [[9,11]]. Standard bacterial DNA extraction protocols are often insufficient, leading to poor DNA yield and biased representation of the true mycobiome [[4]]. Robust methods require a combination of mechanical disruption (e.g., repeated bead-beating) and enzymatic digestion (e.g., lyticase) [[2,9]]. A comparative study by Huseyin et al. evaluated five different commercial kits and found that the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit combined with bead beating (BB) or a repeat bead-beating and column-based (RBBC) protocol yielded the highest DNA concentrations and quality [[1,5]]. They recommended RBBC as the optimal method for standardization [[1]]. Furthermore, sample handling prior to processing can introduce artifacts; freezing fecal samples has been shown to cause a significant reduction in culturable fungal viability, though its effect on DNA-based analysis varies depending on the extraction method used [[1,5]].\n\nThe bioinformatics pipeline is the final, and arguably most complex, stage of analysis. Raw sequence reads must be processed to remove errors and contaminants. Tools like DADA2 are used to infer amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with high accuracy, mitigating PCR and sequencing errors [[2,16]]. Contamination control is paramount, and strategies such as including negative controls in every sequencing run and using software packages like decontam to statistically identify and filter contaminant sequences are essential [[8]]. Taxonomic assignment is performed using curated reference databases. The UNITE database is the most prominent for fungal ITS sequences, but it remains severely limited, containing only a fraction of the estimated 2.2–3.8 million fungal species on Earth [[1,9,11]]. This lack of comprehensive reference data leads to a high rate of unassigned reads, sometimes over 90%, hindering downstream analysis [[1]]. Other databases like SILVA, RDP, and RefSeq are also used [[7]]. Advanced pipelines like LotuS2, PipeCraft, PIPITS, and FindFungi are being developed to streamline and standardize the entire workflow from raw reads to taxonomic tables [[2]]. For metagenomic data, specialized tools like DAnIEL provide web-based access to public datasets and analytical workflows [[2]]. The integration of multi-omics approaches, such as combining ITS2 sequencing with metabolomics, represents the frontier of the field, allowing for the direct linking of microbial community structure to metabolic function [[7]].\n\n| Methodological Step | Common Techniques & Tools                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Key Challenges & Considerations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Representative Citations                                    |\n| :- | :- | :- | :- |\n| **DNA Extraction**  | Commercial Kits: QIAamp (with/without BB), PowerSoil Pro, ZymoBIOMICS<br>Manual Methods: Repeat Bead Beating + Column (RBBC)                                                                                                                                                             | Robust fungal cell wall requires mechanical (bead-beating) and enzymatic (lyticase) lysis.

      "content": "The application of mycobiome research has moved beyond simple description to identifying specific signatures associated with a diverse range of human diseases. Dysbiosis of the gut mycobiome—the disruption of its balanced community—has emerged as a key factor in the pathology of numerous conditions. In gastrointestinal disorders, particularly inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consistent patterns of dysbiosis have been observed. Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by an enrichment of *Malassezia* species, such as *Malassezia globose*, and a depletion of *Yarrowia lipolytica* [[6,16]]. Conversely, ulcerative colitis (UC) is often associated with an increase in *Candida albicans* [[6]]. Meta-analyses of multiple IBD datasets have confirmed that reduced Shannon diversity is a hallmark of the condition [[14]]. Similar trends are seen in colorectal cancer (CRC), where *Malassezia* enrichment has been reported [[7]], and in hepatitis B-associated liver cirrhosis, where patients exhibit significantly higher gut fungal species richness compared to healthy individuals [[3]].\n\nThe links extend far beyond the gut. In neurological disorders, distinct fungal signatures have been detected. In Alzheimer's disease patients, fungal cells from genera *Candida*, *Cladosporium*, *Malassezia*, and *Saccharomyces* have been identified in brain tissue, suggesting a potential role in neurodegeneration [[3]]. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is also associated with mycobiome alterations, with elevated levels of *Candida*, *Malassezia*, and *Trichosporon* found in brain tissue of MS patients [[3]]. Parkinson's disease may be indirectly linked through its association with seborrheic dermatitis, a skin condition where the fungus *Malassezia* is prevalent [[3]]. The connection to metabolic health is also becoming clearer. Type 2 diabetes shows conflicting results in different cohorts, with some studies reporting enrichment of *Candida* and *Saccharomyces* and others noting depletion of *Saccharomyces* [[6,7]]. Obesity has been linked to reduced levels of *Mucor spp.* [[7]], while malnutrition is associated with elevated *Candida albicans* and *Trichosporon krusei* [[7]].\n\nInfectious diseases have also provided compelling case studies. During severe COVID-19 (sCOVID-19), there is a marked shift in the mycobiome, with elevated *C. albicans* IgG antibodies correlating with intestinal overgrowth and mycobiota dysbiosis [[3]]. Patient-derived *C. albicans* strains were shown to enhance lung neutrophilia and NETosis during SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice, a phenotype that could be partially reversed with antifungal therapy or IL-6 receptor blockade [[3]]. This demonstrates a direct pro-inflammatory role for the gut mycobiome in a systemic viral disease. In preterm infants, who are highly susceptible to invasive candidiasis, *Candida* spp. are dominant, and their increasing abundance is linked to gestational age and antibiotic exposure [[9,11]]. Of particular concern is the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens like *Candida auris*, which causes high mortality rates in neonatal intensive care units [[9,11]]. Oral cancers show a higher abundance of *C. albicans* in tumor tissue compared to benign tissue, where it may promote carcinogenesis through chronic inflammation and epigenetic modifications [[3]]. Finally, the mycobiome also plays a beneficial role in health. A longitudinal study of children found that higher gut fungal abundance at age 2 was positively associated with height gain between ages 2 and 9, representing an estimated 3–4 cm difference by age 6 [[4]]. This suggests that a healthy mycobiome contributes to normal growth and development.",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The gut mycobiome does not exist in isolation; it is engaged in a constant dialogue with its host and with the vast bacterial microbiome. These interactions are central to maintaining homeostasis and determining susceptibility to disease. The immune system employs a dedicated surveillance mechanism to monitor the fungal community. The key player in this process is the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1, which recognizes β-glucans on the surface of fungi [[10,12]]. Recognition by Dectin-1 triggers a cascade of anti-fungal immune responses, including the induction of Th17 cells and the production of secretory IgA (sIgA), which helps regulate fungal morphology and maintain commensalism [[2]]. Genetic variations in immune receptors can profoundly alter the host-mycobiome relationship. For example, a polymorphism in the *CARD9* gene, an adaptor protein involved in signaling from Dectin-1, is linked to an increased risk of developing Crohn's disease [[6]]. Similarly, deficiencies in the pattern recognition receptor *CLEC7A* (which encodes Dectin-1) influence the configuration of the mycobiome and predispose individuals to certain infections and inflammatory conditions [[6]].\n\nInterkingdom interactions between fungi and bacteria are intricate and bidirectional. Fungal species can influence the assembly and stability of the bacterial microbiome. For instance, the presence of *Candida albicans* can disrupt bacterial community structure, and high *Candida* abundance in a patient's gut before a fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) procedure is correlated with a lower success rate for treating *Clostridioides difficile* infection [[6]]. Conversely, the bacterial microbiome shapes the fungal community. Antibiotics, for example, not only kill bacteria but also create ecological niches that can be exploited by certain fungi, leading to dysbiosis [[2]]. Diet is another powerful modulator of interkingdom dynamics. A carbohydrate-rich diet has been shown to increase *Candida* levels, while a protein-rich diet reduces it [[6]]. Fermented foods and cheese consumption also appear to modulate fungal composition, highlighting the role of food-borne fungi in shaping the gut ecosystem [[6]]. Even the environment plays a part; a study of nonhuman primates revealed a strong phylosymbiosis, where the evolutionary relatedness of the host species strongly predicted the similarity of their gut mycobiomes, suggesting co-evolutionary pressures are at play [[13]]. These interactions are further complicated by the fact that some fungi, like *Malassezia*, are typically skin-dwelling organisms that can be transmitted to the gut, adding another layer of complexity to distinguishing resident versus transient species [[2]]. The cumulative evidence points toward a deeply integrated ecosystem where fungi are not merely passengers but active participants, influencing and being influenced by their bacterial neighbors and their host's immune system.",

      "content": "Despite significant progress, the field of mycobiome research faces substantial challenges that hinder the translation of discoveries into clinical practice. One of the most persistent obstacles is the lack of standardized methodologies. There is no universally accepted protocol for sample collection, DNA extraction, or sequencing, which makes it difficult to compare results across different studies and replicate findings [[2,7]]. This issue is compounded by the inherent biological complexities of fungi. Their robust cell walls necessitate specialized lysis techniques, and their low biomass in stool samples means that fungal DNA can be easily lost during purification [[2,9]]. Furthermore, the accuracy of any sequencing-based analysis is fundamentally constrained by the completeness of reference databases. The UNITE database, while the best available resource, contains sequences for only a tiny fraction of the estimated millions of fungal species, leading to a high rate of unidentified operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and limiting the precision of taxonomic assignments [[1,9,11]]. This problem is exacerbated by unstable fungal taxonomy, where historical nomenclature changes can create confusion in the literature [[2]].\n\nAnother major challenge lies in interpreting the functional significance of observed dysbiosis. Most studies are correlative, identifying associations between specific fungal taxa and disease states. Establishing causality is exceptionally difficult but essential for developing targeted therapies. Longitudinal studies are needed to define what constitutes a truly stable, healthy mycobiome and to differentiate transient environmental exposures from persistent, resident populations [[2]]. Many critical questions remain unanswered, particularly regarding the perinatal period. While we know that delivery mode and breastfeeding shape the infant mycobiome [[3,8]], the specific causal pathways and long-term consequences for health are still unclear. For instance, despite the known link between bacterial dysbiosis and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants, no studies currently link mycobiome dysbiosis to NEC, creating a significant gap in our understanding of this devastating disease [[9,11]].\n\nFuture research must address these gaps through a multi-pronged approach. First, the development and validation of standardized protocols are paramount. This includes optimizing DNA extraction methods and validating universal primer sets that can capture the full breadth of fungal diversity. Second, technological innovation must continue. The adoption of long-read sequencing platforms like PacBio and Oxford Nanopore should become more widespread to overcome the limitations of short-read bias [[11,15]]. Third, the creation of more comprehensive and accurate reference databases is a non-negotiable priority. Initiatives like the cultivation of new human gut fungi and the generation of their genomic sequences are crucial steps in this direction [[14]]. Fourth, the field must move decisively from correlation to causation. This requires the use of model systems, such as gnotobiotic mice colonized with defined fungal communities, to test hypotheses about pathogenic mechanisms. Finally, the integration of multi-omics approaches—combining sequencing data with metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics—is essential to link the presence of specific fungi to their actual metabolic outputs and their effects on host physiology [[7]]. By pursuing these avenues, the mycobiome research community can unlock the full potential of this fascinating and clinically relevant ecosystem.\n\n---",
