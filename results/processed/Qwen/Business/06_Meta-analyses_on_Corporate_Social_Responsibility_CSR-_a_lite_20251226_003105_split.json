      "content": "Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has evolved from a peripheral concept into a central pillar of modern business strategy, governance, and public policy. The rapid expansion of CSR-related research is reflected in the exponential growth of academic publications; one bibliometric study documented an annual growth rate of 10.04% in CSR literature between 1979 and 2023 [[1]]. This surge in interest is driven by profound shifts in societal expectations, regulatory pressures, and investor demands for businesses to operate responsibly within their economic, social, and environmental contexts [[7,14]]. However, this proliferation of research has also created significant challenges for scholars and practitioners seeking to synthesize findings and derive actionable insights. The sheer volume and diversity of studies have led to fragmented knowledge and conflicting conclusions regarding the precise nature of the relationship between CSR initiatives and firm performance, as well as the contextual factors that shape these outcomes.\n\nIn response to this complexity, meta-analysis—a quantitative statistical method used to combine the results of multiple primary studies—has become an indispensable tool in CSR research. Meta-analytic reviews provide a powerful means of synthesizing vast bodies of evidence, identifying overarching patterns, and resolving discrepancies in the literature. They allow researchers to move beyond individual studies, which may be limited by sample size or specific context, to generate more robust and generalizable conclusions. Consequently, the field of CSR meta-analyses has matured rapidly, with the first known meta-analysis appearing as early as 1997 and a dramatic increase in publication since 2010 [[4]]. Today, these reviews are published in top-tier journals such as *Organization Studies*, *Journal of Business Ethics*, and the *Strategic Management Journal*, underscoring their growing importance and credibility [[2,4,9]].\n\nThe primary motivation for this systematic literature review is to conduct a comprehensive and critical synthesis of the extensive body of meta-analytic research on CSR. While previous reviews have offered valuable summaries, the field continues to evolve at a rapid pace, with new methodologies, theoretical frameworks, and empirical findings emerging regularly. This review aims to provide a current and nuanced understanding of the state-of-the-art in CSR meta-research. It seeks to answer fundamental questions: What are the core findings regarding the effect of CSR on financial and non-financial outcomes? How do country-level culture, economy, and governance moderate these effects? What are the key theoretical underpinnings and how are they being operationalized? By systematically examining the landscape of CSR meta-analyses, this paper will identify not only what is known but also where the critical gaps and unresolved debates lie. The ultimate objective is to chart the progress of the field, assess its methodological strengths and weaknesses, and outline promising avenues for future inquiry that can further advance our understanding of corporate responsibility in a globalized world.",

      "content": "The conceptualization and analysis of Corporate Social Responsibility are deeply rooted in a diverse array of foundational theories that provide different lenses through which to view the motivations, mechanisms, and consequences of corporate action. These theories guide how researchers define CSR constructs, formulate hypotheses, and interpret empirical findings within meta-analytic reviews. Understanding this theoretical landscape is crucial for appreciating the varied perspectives and sometimes contradictory results that populate the CSR literature. The most dominant theoretical frameworks identified in recent bibliometric analyses include stakeholder theory, institutional theory, and the triple bottom line (TBL), alongside other influential concepts like legitimacy theory and shareholder value theory [[1,11,12]].\n\nStakeholder theory, first articulated by R. Edward Freeman in the 1980s, is arguably the most frequently cited theoretical foundation in CSR research [[9]]. It posits that a corporation's existence and success depend on its relationships with a wide range of stakeholders—including employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and the environment—not just shareholders [[9]]. From this perspective, CSR is not merely a discretionary activity but a strategic imperative to manage these relationships effectively. Stakeholder theory provides a powerful explanation for why firms engage in CSR: to build goodwill, mitigate conflict, and create long-term value by addressing the interests and expectations of all affected parties. Many meta-analyses implicitly or explicitly use stakeholder theory to argue that positive CSR actions lead to favorable outcomes, such as enhanced brand loyalty, improved customer relationship quality, and better employee attitudes, mediated by constructs like trust and organizational justice [[2,4]]. For instance, the finding that consumer responses are stronger for core CSR (directly impacting employees, customers) than extended CSR (impacting society at large) can be interpreted through a stakeholder lens, suggesting that proximity and direct impact amplify perceived stakeholder obligations [[3]].\n\nInstitutional theory offers another major explanatory framework, focusing on how organizations conform to external pressures and norms to gain legitimacy [[11]]. This theory suggests that firms adopt CSR practices not only for strategic advantage but also because they are expected to comply with the prevailing rules, norms, and values of their institutional environment. These environments can be national (e.g., legal systems, cultural values) or industry-wide. Institutional theory helps explain why CSR practices vary across countries and industries and why certain CSR activities become \"institutionalized\" over time, such as the adoption of ISO 26000 guidelines [[7]]. In meta-analytic studies, institutional theory is often invoked to explain moderating effects, such as how differences in legal enforcement or government regulation influence the strength of the CSR-performance link [[11]]. The classification of CSR theories into groups by Garriga and Melé (2004) and Domènec Melé (2009) further refines this landscape, distinguishing between instrumental theories (viewing CSR as a tool for achieving economic goals), political theories (emphasizing corporate power), integrative theories (linking corporate survival to societal health), and ethical theories (asserting moral duties) [[12,13]].\n\nBeyond these mainstream theories, several other concepts are pivotal. The Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework, introduced by John Elkington in 1998, expands the traditional focus on financial performance to include social and environmental dimensions, arguing for a balanced approach to measuring success [[7]]. The Creating Shared Value (CSV) concept, developed by Michael Porter and Mark Kramer, represents a more recent evolution, linking CSR directly to a company's core business strategy to create both societal benefits and economic value simultaneously [[7]]. Legitimacy theory, closely related to institutional theory, argues that firms seek to align their actions with societal norms to maintain their \"license to operate\" [[4]]. Finally, shareholder value theory presents a counter-perspective, viewing CSR as a potential distraction from the primary goal of maximizing profits for owners [[13]]. The ongoing debate between these theories—particularly between stakeholder-oriented views and shareholder-focused ones—underpins many of the empirical disputes in the CSR literature and is a recurring theme in meta-analytic interpretations of conflicting results. The choice of theoretical lens profoundly shapes the research questions asked and the conclusions drawn about the complex dynamics of corporate responsibility.",

      "content": "The intellectual journey of Corporate Social Responsibility has been a long and transformative one, evolving from isolated acts of philanthropy to a complex, multifaceted discipline embedded within the core functions of modern business. This historical development is marked by key thinkers, seminal publications, and pivotal events that have shaped the way we understand and study the relationship between corporations and society. The timeline of CSR research reflects broader shifts in economic thought, social consciousness, and technological capability, culminating in the sophisticated, data-driven field of today.\n\nThe academic study of CSR formally began with Howard R. Bowen's 1953 book, *Social Responsibilities of the Businessman* [[7]]. In this work, Bowen, often called the 'Father of Corporate Social Responsibility', posed the fundamental question of what responsibilities business leaders owe to society beyond their economic and legal obligations. His inquiries laid the groundwork for decades of subsequent research and established CSR as a legitimate subject for scholarly investigation [[7]]. Early research in the 1970s and 1980s built upon this foundation, with works by Preston (1978a, 1978b) and Newgren et al. (1985) exploring the nascent ideas of corporate social performance [[6]]. This period was characterized by descriptive studies and philosophical debates about the very definition of CSR.\n\nA significant turning point came in the 1980s and 1990s with the formalization of competing theoretical frameworks. The introduction of stakeholder theory by R. Edward Freeman in his 1984 book provided a powerful alternative to the shareholder primacy model, arguing that corporations must consider the interests of all stakeholders to achieve long-term success [[9]]. Archie Carroll’s 1991 Pyramid of Corporate Social Responsibility offered a clear, hierarchical model encompassing economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic responsibilities, which became a widely adopted framework for structuring discussions of CSR [[7]]. Simultaneously, the 1990s saw the rise of environmental concerns and social movements, leading to the establishment of global frameworks like the United Nations Global Compact in 2000 and the development of standards such as ISO 26000, which helped to institutionalize CSR principles worldwide [[7,14]].\n\nThe transition to a more empirical and analytical approach is evident in the emergence of meta-analysis as a key research method. The first known meta-analysis on CSR was conducted by Marc Orlitzky in 1998 as part of his dissertation at the University of Iowa [[6]]. His work, later expanded and published in 2003 with co-authors Schmidt and Rynes, titled \"Corporate social and financial performance: A meta-analysis,\" became a landmark publication in the field [[9]]. This seminal study synthesized the findings of numerous prior studies and concluded that there was a positive correlation between CSR and financial performance, providing strong support for the \"business case\" for CSR. Its immense influence is reflected in its status as one of the most-cited articles in the field, with over 4,700 citations according to one analysis [[2]].\n\nThe 21st century has witnessed an explosion in both the volume and sophistication of CSR research. The launch of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 marked a new era, providing a universal framework for corporate sustainability efforts and shifting the focus from isolated CSR initiatives to integrated, systemic contributions to societal well-being [[14]]. Concurrently, the rise of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria has provided a standardized language and set of metrics for investors and firms to evaluate and report on corporate responsibility, further accelerating research in this area [[14]]. This period has also seen the advent of advanced analytical techniques within meta-analysis, including panel data models, system GMM, quantile regression, and three-level mixed-effects models, allowing for more nuanced and robust testing of complex relationships [[2,5]]. This historical trajectory demonstrates a clear progression from philosophical inquiry to empirical validation and now to sophisticated, context-aware analysis, reflecting the increasing complexity and importance of CSR in the global economy.",

      "content": "The methodology of CSR meta-analysis has undergone a significant transformation, moving from relatively simple statistical aggregations to highly sophisticated analytical frameworks designed to handle complexity, control for bias, and uncover deeper causal mechanisms. This evolution reflects a maturation of the field, driven by the need for more rigorous and defensible conclusions in the face of conflicting evidence. The current state-of-the-art in CSR meta-research is characterized by a focus on advanced statistical modeling, comprehensive moderator analysis, and greater attention to methodological rigor and transparency.\n\nA cornerstone of modern meta-analysis is the use of random-effects models, which are now standard practice in a majority of CSR meta-analyses to account for heterogeneity—the variability in effect sizes across primary studies [[4,8]]. Unlike fixed-effects models, which assume a single true effect size underlying all studies, random-effects models acknowledge that studies are likely estimating different, yet related, population parameters due to variations in samples, interventions, or contexts. This more realistic assumption leads to wider confidence intervals and more conservative conclusions. Beyond bivariate analysis, contemporary meta-analyses increasingly employ multivariate techniques to explore the roles of mediating and moderating variables. For example, studies have identified intangible resources and reputation as mediators between CSR and financial performance [[2]], while analyzing moderators such as board independence, gender diversity, and ownership structure to understand their influence on CSR outcomes [[4,11]]. Methodologies like panel data analysis, system GMM, and quantile regression are also being employed to address endogeneity and other econometric challenges [[2]].\n\nA particularly advanced technique gaining prominence is the three-level mixed-effects model. This approach allows researchers to disentangle variance at multiple levels—for example, sampling variance, within-study variance, and between-study variance—which is especially useful when dealing with clustered or nested data structures [[5]]. Vieira et al. (2025) utilized this model to great effect, demonstrating its ability to provide more accurate estimates by properly accounting for the hierarchical nature of their dataset, which included multiple effect sizes from the same studies [[5]]. Such methods represent a significant leap forward in analytical precision compared to earlier meta-analyses that might have treated all effect sizes as independent observations.\n\nHowever, the increased sophistication of analytical tools is matched by a growing awareness of the need for methodological rigor and transparency. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, first established in 2009 and updated in 2020, have become a benchmark for reporting standards in systematic reviews [[15]]. These guidelines aim to enhance the quality and consistency of reports by requiring transparent documentation of the review protocol, search strategy, study selection process, risk of bias assessment, and data synthesis methods [[15]]. Despite their widespread endorsement, a study evaluating nursing reviews found that even Cochrane reviews, which are considered high-quality, scored only moderately on the PRISMA checklist, with significant deficiencies in areas like protocol registration, detailed search strategies, and risk of bias assessments [[16]]. This highlights a persistent gap between ideal reporting standards and actual practice, a challenge that extends to CSR meta-analyses.\n\nFurthermore, addressing inherent biases remains a central challenge. Publication bias, where studies with statistically significant results are more likely to be published, is a well-documented threat to the validity of meta-analytic findings [[4]]. Researchers now employ more advanced statistical tests, such as the Precision-Effect Test (PET) and Fail-Safe Test (FAT), to detect and adjust for this bias. For instance, the Servaes & Tamayo (2013) meta-analysis used a PET-FAT test and found strong evidence of publication bias, concluding that the true effect of CSR on financial performance might be weaker than originally reported [[10]]. Endogeneity, where unobserved confounding variables correlate with both CSR and performance, is another critical issue that threatens causal inference [[4]]. Addressing these challenges requires not only sophisticated statistical corrections but also a commitment to pre-registering studies and using more robust designs, such as longitudinal analyses or quasi-experimental methods, to strengthen causal claims. The current state of the art is therefore one of balancing powerful new analytical capabilities with a heightened sense of methodological responsibility.\n\n| Methodological Aspect | Description | Representative Sources |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Statistical Models** | Use of random-effects models to account for heterogeneity; advanced models like panel data, system GMM, and quantile regression to address endogeneity. | [[2,4]] |\n| **Moderator Analysis** | Examination of variables that influence the strength of the CSR-performance relationship, including firm-specific attributes, country-level factors, and governance structures. | [[3,4,11]] |\n| **Mediator Analysis** | Exploration of the underlying mechanisms through which CSR impacts outcomes, such as reputation, competitive advantage, trust, and organizational justice. | [[2,4]] |\n| **Reporting Standards** | Adherence to PRISMA guidelines to ensure transparency in literature search, study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. | [[15,16]] |\n| **Bias Detection** | Use of statistical tests like PET-FAT to detect and correct for publication bias and other forms of selection bias. | [[4,10]] |",

      "content": "Meta-analyses on Corporate Social Responsibility provide a rich source of evidence on the practical applications of CSR and its impact on a wide range of corporate outcomes. The findings consistently support the notion of a \"business case\" for CSR, demonstrating a positive association between responsible behavior and firm performance. However, the strength and direction of this relationship are not uniform; they are significantly moderated by a host of contextual factors, including national culture, economic conditions, industry type, and stakeholder characteristics. Understanding these moderators is crucial for translating broad meta-analytic findings into targeted, effective CSR strategies.\n\nOne of the most robust findings across numerous meta-analyses is the positive correlation between CSR performance and financial performance (FP) [[4,11]]. This supports the idea that engaging in socially and environmentally responsible activities can enhance profitability, improve market valuation, and create shareholder value. Similarly, CSR performance is positively linked to various non-financial outcomes. These include superior environmental performance [[4]], enhanced brand loyalty [[4]], higher customer relationship quality [[4]], and more positive employee attitudes [[4]]. The underlying mechanisms, or mediators, for these effects appear to be psychological and relational, with organizational justice, trust, and employee identification acting as key conduits through which CSR initiatives translate into positive outcomes [[4]]. Another application area is consumer behavior, where CSR initiatives can positively influence consumer attitudes and purchase intentions. A 2025 meta-analysis by Vieira et al. found a medium overall positive effect size (r = .38) on consumer responses, though it also highlighted an attitude-behavior gap, with the effect being stronger for attitudinal responses than for actual behavioral ones (r = .35 vs. r = .44) [[5]].\n\nThe influence of contextual factors is where the application of meta-analytic findings becomes most nuanced and strategically relevant. Country-level moderators play a particularly important role. A meta-analysis by Peng et al. (2024) found that the positive effect of core CSR is stronger in societies with secular-rational values compared to traditional ones, and is amplified by higher internet penetration but diminished by higher economic growth rates [[3]]. Another study revealed that the effect of social CSR in consumer staples was positive in high-HDI countries but negative in low-HDI countries, illustrating how macroeconomic development level interacts with CSR type and industry [[5]]. Cultural dimensions, such as Hofstede's individualism scores, also serve as significant moderators, influencing how consumers respond to different types of CSR initiatives [[5]]. Industry type is another critical factor; controversial industries like oil and gas tend to receive less favorable responses to CSR claims, possibly due to skepticism or \"greenwashing\" accusations, highlighting the need for authentic and substantive CSR actions in these sectors [[5]].\n\nCase studies and real-world examples bring these abstract findings to life. The failure of Shell's CSR projects in Nigeria's Niger Delta serves as a stark reminder that CSR initiatives can backfire if they lack genuine community engagement and fail to address deep-seated issues of distrust and injustice [[1]]. Conversely, China's implementation of a stricter Environmental Protection Law in 2014 led to a 34% increase in sustainable practices among firms, demonstrating the powerful impact of regulatory pressure as a driver of CSR [[1]]. The use of technology also presents new opportunities for applying CSR principles. The adoption of AI and blockchain in apparel supply chains has been shown to improve transparency by as much as 40%, helping to combat labor exploitation and environmental harm [[1]]. However, the uneven distribution of such technologies underscores existing inequalities, with only 12% of African firms having adopted them [[1]]. The table below summarizes some key moderating factors identified in recent meta-analytic research.\n\n| Moderator Category | Specific Factor | Impact on CSR-Performance Link | Source(s) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Country-Level** | National Culture (Secular-Rational vs. Traditional) | Positive effect of core CSR is stronger in secular-rational societies. | [[3]] |\n| | Economic Growth Rate | Positive effect of core CSR is diminished in countries with higher economic growth. | [[3]] |\n| | Human Development Index (HDI) | Effect of social CSR in consumer staples is positive in high-HDI countries but negative in low-HDI countries. | [[5]] |\n| | Legal Regime (Civil Law) | Stronger CSR-financial performance link in civil law regimes compared to common law. | [[4]] |\n| **Industry-Level** | Controversial Industries (e.g., Financials, Oil & Gas) | Ethical CSR shows a stronger positive effect in developed nations, but industries are often underrepresented. | [[2,5]] |\n| **Stakeholder-Level** | Sample Type (Student vs. Non-Student) | Student samples yield significantly lower overall effect sizes for CSR on consumer attitudes. | [[5]] |\n| | Consumer Attitude-Behavior Gap | Attitudinal responses to CSR show a stronger effect than behavioral responses. | [[5]] |\n\nThese findings collectively indicate that CSR is not a one-size-fits-all strategy. Its effectiveness is contingent on a deep understanding of the local context, stakeholder perceptions, and the alignment of CSR initiatives with core business operations and values.",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Despite the significant progress made in CSR meta-analysis, the field is beset by a series of critical challenges and open problems that threaten the validity, generalizability, and practical utility of its findings. These issues span the entire research pipeline, from the initial literature search to the final interpretation of results, and require concerted effort from the research community to address. The most prominent challenges revolve around publication bias, methodological inconsistencies, regional and sectoral imbalances, and the limitations of correlational analysis.\n\nPublication bias stands out as one of the most pervasive threats to the integrity of meta-analytic conclusions [[4]]. Because studies with statistically significant results are more likely to be published than those with null or negative findings, meta-analyses that rely solely on published literature are prone to an overestimation of the true effect size. Several studies have explicitly detected this bias; for example, the Servaes & Tamayo (2013) meta-analysis used statistical tests to conclude that the positive link between CSR and financial performance was likely inflated by the absence of small, unpublished studies with negative results [[10]]. The problem is compounded by poor reporting practices, where many studies fail to register their protocols in advance, making it difficult to distinguish between planned and post-hoc analyses [[16]]. This selective reporting exacerbates the bias and reduces transparency. Addressing this requires a commitment to preregistration of reviews and a push for the publication of all high-quality studies, regardless of their outcome.\n\nMethodological inconsistencies and a lack of standardization present another significant hurdle. While many meta-analyses now use random-effects models, there is still considerable variation in how studies are selected, coded, and analyzed [[4]]. This inconsistency makes it difficult to compare findings across different reviews and can lead to conflicting conclusions. For instance, one meta-analysis might find a curvilinear relationship between CSR and financial performance, while another finds a simple linear one, partly due to differences in the sample of primary studies included and the statistical models employed [[2]]. Furthermore, a notable weakness identified in a review of 54 meta-analyses is the frequent omission of mediator analyses [[4]]. Without understanding the mechanisms through which CSR creates value, the findings remain descriptive rather than explanatory. Similarly, while moderation analysis is common, the choice of moderators is often ad hoc, lacking a strong theoretical basis for why certain variables should be examined.\n\nPerhaps the most significant challenge lies in the geographical and sectoral representation of the research base. The vast majority of CSR studies are conducted in Western contexts, with one bibliometric analysis noting that 76% of studies are based on data from Europe and North America [[1]]. This over-reliance on a narrow slice of the global landscape limits the applicability of findings to developing countries, which face different economic, political, and social realities. The underrepresentation of Africa is particularly stark, with one analysis noting its presence primarily through studies in Ghana [[2]]. This geographic imbalance is mirrored in industry representation, where certain sectors like mining and tech are heavily studied, while others are neglected [[1]]. This skew can lead to a distorted view of CSR, potentially overlooking unique challenges and solutions that exist in non-Western and non-tech industries. The inclusion of controversial industries in meta-analyses is also critically low, representing only 6.4% of studies in one review, which may bias results towards less challenging corporate environments [[5]].\n\nFinally, the inherent limitations of correlational analysis pose a fundamental barrier to establishing causality. While meta-analyses can demonstrate that CSR and financial performance tend to move together, they cannot definitively prove that CSR *causes* better financial outcomes. Alternative explanations, such as omitted variable bias, where a third, unmeasured factor (like management quality or industry profitability) drives both CSR and performance, are always a concern [[4,10]]. This is especially true in observational studies, which form the bulk of the data used in meta-analyses. The inability to establish a clear causal chain is a major impediment to building airtight arguments for the business case for CSR and designing policies aimed at fostering it. To overcome this, future research must embrace more robust methodologies, such as longitudinal designs, natural experiments, and quasi-experimental approaches, to provide stronger evidence for causal pathways.",

      "content": "In conclusion, the systematic review of meta-analyses on Corporate Social Responsibility reveals a vibrant and rapidly advancing field, yet one that is constrained by significant challenges and ripe with opportunities for future inquiry. The journey from Bowen's foundational questions to today's sophisticated, multi-level meta-analyses has yielded a wealth of knowledge, but also highlighted the complexities and nuances inherent in studying corporate responsibility. The path forward requires a concerted effort to address existing limitations and explore new frontiers to deepen our understanding of how and why CSR matters in the 21st century.\n\nSynthesizing the key findings, the evidence strongly supports a positive, albeit conditional, relationship between CSR and corporate performance. There is a robust business case for CSR, which enhances financial standing, brand equity, and stakeholder relations. However, this relationship is far from deterministic. Its strength is profoundly shaped by a web of moderators, including national culture, economic development, legal systems, and industry context. Furthermore, the distinction between core CSR (benefiting direct stakeholders) and extended CSR (benefiting society at large) appears to be a critical dimension, with core initiatives often yielding stronger and more consistent positive responses [[3]]. Methodologically, the field has moved decisively towards more rigorous statistical models like random-effects and three-level mixed-effects analyses, and towards greater transparency through adherence to reporting guidelines like PRISMA [[4,5,15]]. Yet, the field remains vulnerable to publication bias, methodological inconsistencies, and a heavy reliance on Western-centric data, which constrains the generalizability of its findings [[1,4,10]].\n\nBased on these insights, several key future research directions emerge. First, there is an urgent need for more research that moves beyond correlation to establish causality. Future studies should leverage longitudinal data, panel data models, and quasi-experimental designs to better isolate the causal effects of CSR initiatives from other confounding variables [[4,10]]. Second, the field must broaden its geographical and sectoral scope. A critical research gap exists in conducting meta-analyses that are specifically focused on developing economies, particularly in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia [[1,2]]. Similarly, more research is needed on CSR in controversial industries and on the role of CSR in non-profit and public sector organizations. Third, the call for more rigorous and theoretically grounded mediation analysis must be answered [[4,11]]. Future work should aim to build and test more explicit models of how CSR translates into value creation, exploring novel mediators like innovation capacity, digital trust, and ESG reporting quality.\n\nFinally, the next frontier for CSR research lies in exploring the dynamic interplay between CSR and emerging trends. This includes investigating the role of CSR in building resilience against climate change and geopolitical instability, understanding how AI and automation reshape corporate responsibilities, and examining the link between CSR and employee well-being in the context of the \"great resignation.\" As CSR transitions from a niche topic to a mandatory operational principle, driven by international institutions and investor pressure, the research must evolve to provide actionable guidance for navigating this new reality [[7]]. By embracing these challenges and pursuing these new directions, the field of CSR meta-analysis can continue to mature, providing the robust, context-aware, and ethically-grounded knowledge necessary to foster a more sustainable and equitable global economy.\n\n---",
