      "content": "Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors have emerged as a cornerstone technology in the field of optical sensing, offering unparalleled capabilities for monitoring a wide range of physical parameters. Their unique operating principle, based on wavelength-encoded signals, provides significant advantages over traditional electrical sensors, particularly in environments characterized by electromagnetic interference, corrosive conditions, or extreme temperatures. The fundamental motivation driving the development and adoption of FBG technology is its potential to enable real-time, high-fidelity, and distributed structural health monitoring (SHM) across diverse and demanding sectors, including aerospace, civil infrastructure, energy systems, and biomedical engineering. The core appeal lies in the sensor's passive, remote nature, which allows for deployment in locations where conventional sensors are impractical or impossible to use.\n\nThe primary research objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the current state of FBG sensor technology. This involves dissecting the foundational principles that govern their operation, tracing their historical evolution from laboratory curiosity to industrial workhorse, and examining the sophisticated methods used for signal demodulation and system multiplexing. By critically evaluating the extensive body of literature on applications, we aim to illuminate how FBG sensors are being deployed to solve complex, real-world problems. Furthermore, this review delves into the persistent challenges and open technical problems that researchers are actively working to overcome. Finally, it synthesizes these findings to identify critical gaps in the existing knowledge base and to project future research trajectories, thereby charting a course for the next generation of FBG-based sensing solutions. The ultimate goal is to furnish researchers, engineers, and decision-makers with a rigorous and insightful resource that captures the full scope of what FBG sensors can achieve today and what they promise for tomorrow.\n\nThe technological significance of FBG sensors stems directly from their operational mechanism. An FBG is a permanent periodic variation of the refractive index in the core of an optical fiber [[5,9]]. This structure acts as a highly selective mirror, reflecting light at a specific wavelength, known as the Bragg wavelength (λB), while transmitting all others [[3,4]]. The value of λB is determined by the effective refractive index (neff) of the fiber core and the grating period (Λ), as defined by the equation λB = 2neffΛ [[2,3]]. When the fiber is subjected to changes in strain or temperature, both neff and Λ are altered, resulting in a proportional shift of the reflected Bragg wavelength [[4,5]]. This wavelength shift serves as the measurement signal, a feature that endows FBG sensors with exceptional properties. Because the information is encoded in the wavelength of light, it is inherently immune to signal degradation caused by cable length, connector losses, or power fluctuations—issues that plague amplitude- or frequency-modulated electrical sensors [[3]]. This immunity makes FBG systems exceptionally robust and reliable for long-term, quasi-distributed sensing deployments. The ability to multiplex hundreds or even thousands of individual FBGs along a single optical fiber transforms them from simple point sensors into powerful networks capable of providing spatially resolved measurements, a capability that is revolutionizing fields like SHM for large structures such as bridges, wind turbines, and aircraft wings [[3,9]].\n\nThe practical utility of FBG sensors is further enhanced by their physical characteristics. They are extremely small and lightweight, typically a few millimeters to a centimeter in length, allowing for non-intrusive integration into host materials without significantly altering their mechanical properties [[9]]. They are also chemically inert and electrically passive, making them ideal for use in flammable, explosive, or biologically sensitive environments [[1,3]]. The combination of these attributes—robustness, immunity to EMI, miniaturization, and multiplexing capability—positions FBG technology not merely as an incremental improvement over existing sensors but as a paradigm-shifting platform for advanced sensing. The research presented in this review seeks to explore the depth and breadth of this paradigm, from its theoretical underpinnings to its most challenging and promising applications.",

      "content": "The operational effectiveness of Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors is rooted in a set of well-defined physical principles that govern the interaction between light and the modulated fiber core. Understanding these fundamentals is essential to appreciating the sensor's capabilities and limitations. At its core, an FBG is a microscopic diffraction grating written into the core of a single-mode optical fiber [[9]]. This grating consists of a periodic or aperiodic modulation of the fiber's refractive index, typically with a period on the order of hundreds of nanometers, which corresponds to the wavelengths of visible and near-infrared light used in telecommunications [[4,5]]. The central equation defining this phenomenon is the Bragg condition: λB = 2neffΛ, where λB is the Bragg wavelength, neff is the effective refractive index of the guided mode, and Λ is the grating period [[2,3,4]]. Light traveling through the fiber core encounters this periodic index change, and constructive interference occurs for only one specific wavelength—the Bragg wavelength—which is then reflected back, while the rest of the spectrum passes through [[9]]. This creates a sharp, narrow reflection peak in the fiber's transmission spectrum.\n\nThe sensitivity of an FBG to external physical parameters arises from its response to any perturbation that alters either the effective refractive index (neff) or the physical grating period (Λ). These alterations are primarily driven by two phenomena: the photoelastic effect and thermal expansion. When mechanical strain (ε) is applied to the fiber, it causes a change in the grating period (ΔΛ) and also modifies the material's refractive index via the photoelastic effect (Δn) [[3,5]]. The total relative shift in the Bragg wavelength due to strain (Δε) and temperature (ΔT) can be expressed by the coupled equation ΔλB/λB = (1−pe)Δε + (αΛ+αn)ΔT, where pe is the strain-optic coefficient, αΛ is the thermal expansion coefficient, and αn is the thermo-optic coefficient [[2]]. For silica fibers, typical values show a strong dependence on the operational wavelength. At 1550 nm, the strain sensitivity is approximately 1.2 pm/µε, while the temperature sensitivity is around 13 pm/°C [[2,6,9]]. In contrast, at 830 nm, the sensitivities are lower, at about 0.64 pm/µε for strain and 6.8 pm/°C for temperature [[2]]. Multi-mode FBGs exhibit higher sensitivities than their single-mode counterparts [[5]]. This dual-sensitivity to strain and temperature is a defining characteristic of standard FBGs and presents both a significant challenge and a unique opportunity.\n\nTo exploit this duality, researchers have developed numerous specialized FBG designs tailored for specific sensing functions beyond the basic strain-temperature pair. Uniform FBGs (UFBGs) are the most common type, prized for their high reflectivity and suitability for SHM [[5]]. Apodized FBGs modify the refractive index modulation along the grating length to reduce unwanted side-lobes in the reflection spectrum, improving signal quality [[5]]. Phase-Shifted FBGs (PS-FBGs or π-FBGs) introduce a phase shift of π radians in the middle of the grating, creating a very narrow notch or a sharp resonance peak within the reflection band [[5,6]]. This ultra-narrow feature dramatically enhances the resolution for measuring small shifts, making PS-FBGs ideal for high-frequency ultrasonic detection or precise displacement measurements [[3,6]]. Chirped FBGs (CFBGs) have a grating period that varies along their length, causing them to reflect a broad range of wavelengths [[5]]. This property is exploited for dispersion compensation in telecommunications and for enhancing sensitivity in certain dynamic measurements [[5]]. Tilted FBGs (TFBGs) are inscribed at an angle to the fiber axis, coupling light from the core mode to co-propagating cladding modes [[5]]. As the surrounding refractive index changes, the propagation constants of these cladding modes alter, causing a shift in their respective reflection peaks. This makes TFBGs exceptionally sensitive to ambient refractive index, forming the basis for chemical and biological sensors for applications like glucose monitoring [[14]]. Other exotic variants include Long Period FBGs (LPFGs), which couple light to counter-propagating cladding modes over much longer periods, and random gratings, which offer very broad bandwidth for multi-parameter sensing [[5,9]]. The table below summarizes the key characteristics of these different FBG types.\n\n| FBG Type | Primary Function / Principle | Typical Application Domain |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Uniform FBG (UFBG)** | High reflectivity, standard strain/temperature sensing [[5]] | Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of composites, bridges, concrete [[1,3]] |\n| **Apodized FBG** | Reduced side-lobes in reflection spectrum for improved signal-to-noise ratio [[5]] | Precision SHM, vibration analysis [[6]] |\n| **Phase-Shifted FBG (PS-FBG)** | Creates an ultra-narrow notch/resonance peak for high-resolution measurements [[5,6]] | High-frequency ultrasound detection, precision displacement sensing [[3]] |\n| **Chirped FBG (CFBG)** | Varying grating period reflects a broad spectrum of wavelengths [[5]] | Dispersion compensation, enhanced sensitivity in dynamic measurements [[5]] |\n| **Tilted FBG (TFBG)** | Couples core mode light to cladding modes; sensitive to ambient RI [[5]] | Refractometric sensing, chemical/biological analysis (e.g., glucose) [[14]] |\n| **Long Period FBG (LP-FBG)** | Couples light to counter-propagating cladding modes; sensitive to ambient RI and bending [[5]] | Bending/curvature sensing, fluid property analysis [[1]] |\n| **Random FBG (RFBG)** | Broad bandwidth due to random index modulation; multiple overlapping resonances [[9]] | Multi-parameter sensing, high-bandwidth communication systems [[9]] |\n\nThis diversity of FBG designs underscores a critical insight: the FBG is not a monolithic sensor but a versatile platform whose performance can be tailored to a specific application through careful engineering of its grating structure. From the fundamental UFBG to the highly specialized PS-FBG and TFBG, each variant leverages the core Bragg principle in a distinct way to unlock new sensing modalities and push the boundaries of measurement accuracy and functionality.",

      "content": "The journey of Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) technology from a laboratory discovery to a mature industrial solution is marked by a series of pivotal innovations and breakthroughs. Its history is a testament to the iterative process of scientific discovery, engineering refinement, and strategic application development. The origins of FBG technology trace back to 1978, when K.O. Hill and his colleagues at the Communications Research Centre in Canada first demonstrated photosensitivity in optical fibers and successfully fabricated the first transverse holographic Bragg grating [[1,3,5]]. This seminal work, published in *Applied Physics Letters*, established the fundamental physics of using periodic refractive index modulation in fiber cores to create a wavelength-selective mirror [[1]]. Around the same time, other researchers were exploring similar effects, solidifying the concept as a viable area of study [[5]].\n\nIn the decade following this initial discovery, research focused on refining the inscription techniques and understanding the underlying physics more deeply. Early methods involved transverse holography and direct writing using UV light, which laid the groundwork for subsequent developments [[1]]. A crucial step towards practical application was the demonstration of a strain gauge system in 1993, which showcased the potential of FBGs for mechanical sensing [[3]]. The 1990s proved to be a transformative period, often referred to as the \"golden age\" of FBG innovation. This era saw the introduction of several key enabling technologies that propelled FBG sensors from simple point-measurement tools to complex, networkable systems. A landmark achievement was the first experimental demonstration of multiplexing techniques, including simultaneous spatial, time, and wavelength division multiplexing, reported in 1996 [[1]]. This innovation was revolutionary, as it proved that multiple FBGs could be connected along a single optical fiber and individually interrogated, opening the door to quasi-distributed sensing.\n\nDuring this same period, applications began to emerge across various industries. FBG sensors were successfully applied to monitor strain and failure in textile structural composites and concrete structures, with early studies published in *Smart Materials and Structures* [[1]]. The ability to embed FBGs within composite materials during manufacturing became a key focus, with pioneering work demonstrating their use for in-situ process and condition monitoring in automated fiber placement (AFP) structures [[1]]. This embedding capability was a major advantage, allowing for the creation of \"smart composites\" where the material itself becomes a sensor. Concurrently, interrogation technologies were advancing rapidly. Spectral scanning using Optical Spectrum Analyzers (OSAs) became a standard method for demodulating the wavelength shifts, while tunable lasers were introduced to implement edge-filter methods, which offered higher sensitivity by taking advantage of the low noise of narrowband sources [[3]]. These foundational developments in the 1990s established the core architecture of modern FBG sensing systems: a network of point sensors interrogated by a single optical source and detector.\n\nThe turn of the millennium brought further refinements and the expansion of applications into more demanding environments. Researchers continued to improve sensor design and packaging, developing methods to protect the delicate fiber and enhance its durability and environmental resistance [[3]]. The development of femtosecond (fs) laser writing techniques represented another major milestone. Unlike UV-inscription, which is limited to germanosilicate fibers, fs-lasers can write gratings directly into pure-silica-core fibers, unlocking unprecedented performance in harsh environments [[9,12]]. This technique allowed for the fabrication of Type II gratings that are inherently more stable and radiation-resistant, paving the way for applications in nuclear reactors, gas turbines, and downhole oil and gas exploration [[9,12]]. Simultaneously, the industry saw the emergence of commercial players like LUNA, RUGGED-Monitoring, and Insplorion, who began producing and marketing integrated FBG sensing systems, making the technology more accessible to a wider range of users [[3]]. Today, FBG technology continues to evolve, with ongoing research focused on overcoming long-standing challenges such as cross-sensitivity, cost, and reliability in extreme conditions. The cumulative progress from the first holographic grating to today's advanced fs-laser-written devices illustrates a clear trajectory of increasing sophistication, robustness, and applicability, cementing the FBG as a vital tool for modern science and engineering.",

      "content": "The transition of Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) technology from a laboratory concept to a deployable sensing system hinges on two critical enabling technologies: sophisticated interrogation (demodulation) schemes and advanced multiplexing strategies. While the physical principle of the FBG is elegant in its simplicity, accurately and efficiently reading out the minute wavelength shifts requires complex optical and electronic systems. The state-of-the-art in FBG demodulation has evolved significantly, moving from bulky laboratory equipment to compact, high-speed, and high-resolution commercial instruments. Similarly, multiplexing techniques have matured to allow for the creation of dense sensor networks on a single optical fiber, a prerequisite for true quasi-distributed sensing. The choice of demodulation and multiplexing methods fundamentally defines the performance, cost, and practicality of an FBG sensing system.\n\nAt the heart of any FBG interrogation system is the need to precisely measure the wavelength of the reflected Bragg peak. The most straightforward approach is spectral scanning, where a broadband light source is directed onto the FBG, and the reflected spectrum is analyzed using an Optical Spectrum Analyzer (OSA) [[3]]. While this method offers excellent accuracy and the ability to read multiple FBGs simultaneously, it is relatively slow and expensive, limiting its use to laboratory settings or offline monitoring. To address these limitations, several alternative demodulation techniques have been developed. Edge filtering is a widely used method where a tunable filter, such as a Fabry-Pérot (F-P) tunable filter or an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF), is scanned across the FBG's reflection spectrum. The output intensity is detected, and the wavelength is determined by the filter setting at the peak intensity [[2,4]]. Tunable diode lasers are also employed, offering high resolution and fast acquisition speeds [[2]]. More advanced methods leverage wavelength-to-time mapping, which uses a dispersive element to convert the wavelength shift into a temporal delay, which can then be measured with high-speed photodetectors. One such system boasts a sampling rate of up to 48.6 MHz, a dynamic range of 20 nm, and a strain accuracy of 0.87 µε [[2]]. Recent advancements in interrogation technology include the use of Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) lasers, which offer rapid sweep rates (up to 31.3 kHz) over a wide range (>70 nm), making them suitable for high-speed dynamic measurements [[2]].\n\nThe table below compares some of the key FBG demodulation techniques described in the provided literature.\n\n| Demodulation Technique | Principle | Advantages | Disadvantages | Representative Performance Metrics |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Spectral Scanning (OSA)** | Direct measurement of the reflected spectrum. | High accuracy, high resolution, reads multiple FBGs simultaneously. | Slow, expensive, not suitable for real-time monitoring. | Information not available in provided sources. |\n| **Edge Filter (Tunable Filter/Laser)** | Scan a narrowband filter/laser across the FBG spectrum and detect intensity. | Faster than OSA, higher sensitivity with narrowband sources. | Requires calibration, limited to one FBG per channel without multiplexing. | Information not available in provided sources. |\n| **Wavelength-to-Time Mapping** | Converts wavelength shift into a temporal delay using a dispersive element. | Very high speed (up to 48.6 MHz sampling), wide dynamic range (20 nm). | Complex optical setup, data processing required. | 0.87 µε strain accuracy [[2]]. |\n| **Fourier Domain Mode-Locked (FDML) Laser** | Rapid, linear sweep of a laser wavelength over a broad range. | Very high scan rate (31.3 kHz), good for dynamic measurements. | Slightly narrower sweep range than other methods. | >70 nm sweep range [[2]]. |\n| **Deep Learning Models** | Use neural networks (e.g., LSTM) to extrapolate spectra and estimate parameters. | Can improve accuracy on noisy or incomplete data, enables FOM calculation [[14]]. | Computationally intensive, requires training data. | RMSE of 1.73 × 10⁻² for FWHM estimation [[14]]. |\n\nWhile demodulation focuses on reading a single FBG, multiplexing is the key to building sensor networks. The most common technique is Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), where each FBG in the network is designed to have a slightly different Bragg wavelength. A broadband source illuminates all FBGs simultaneously, and their individual reflections are separated spectrally by the interrogator [[2,9]]. This allows for the connection of dozens or even hundreds of sensors on a single fiber [[3,9]]. Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) is another approach, where short optical pulses are sent down the fiber, and each FBG is assigned a specific time slot based on its distance from the interrogator. Hybrid systems that combine WDM and TDM are also common, allowing for even larger networks [[2]]. Code Division Multiplexing (CDM) uses unique coding sequences for each FBG, enabling parallel interrogation without spectral or temporal separation [[2]]. The synergy between advanced demodulation and multiplexing has enabled groundbreaking applications, such as monitoring the entire surface of a wind turbine blade with dozens of sensors or tracking structural integrity along a bridge or pipeline. However, challenges remain, including managing signal crosstalk in dense networks, ensuring uniform sensitivity across all sensors in a WDM chain, and maintaining high-speed interrogation rates for dynamic event detection. The continuous advancement in these areas is crucial for expanding the scale and complexity of FBG-based monitoring systems.",

      "content": "The versatility and robustness of Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors have led to their widespread adoption across a multitude of fields, transforming how engineers and scientists monitor and understand complex systems. Their ability to provide accurate, distributed, and durable measurements in harsh environments has made them indispensable tools in aerospace, civil engineering, energy systems, and biomedical research. A detailed examination of specific case studies reveals how FBG technology is being deployed to solve critical real-world problems, pushing the boundaries of structural health monitoring, environmental control, and process optimization.\n\nIn the aerospace sector, FBGs are integral to the concept of structural health monitoring (SHM) for next-generation aircraft and spacecraft. Their small size, light weight, and immunity to electromagnetic interference make them ideal for embedding within composite materials, which are increasingly used in airframe construction [[1,5]]. A prime example is the use of embedded FBG sensors to perform in-situ process and condition monitoring during the automated fiber placement (AFP) of composite structures [[1]]. This allows for real-time verification that the curing process is proceeding correctly, preventing defects before they become irreversible. Another key application is the monitoring of fatigue damage in advanced composites, where FBGs can detect micro-cracks and delamination by tracking localized strain changes [[1]]. Beyond static structural health, FBGs are also used in dynamic applications. For instance, they have been incorporated into smart composite materials to monitor vibrations and acoustic emissions, providing early warnings of potential failures [[5]]. Commercially, major automotive and battery manufacturers like LG Chem, General Motors, and Volvo are leveraging FBG technology for Li-ion battery management, using the sensors to monitor internal temperature and strain to prevent overheating and ensure safety [[3]].\n\nCivil engineering represents another major domain for FBG applications, where they are used to monitor the health and performance of large-scale infrastructure. FBGs are routinely deployed to measure strain, temperature, pressure, and deformation in pavements, bridges, and concrete structures [[3]]. One compelling case study involves the use of FBGs to monitor strain in concrete structures, providing data that helps assess load-bearing capacity and predict long-term behavior [[1]]. A particularly innovative application is in the detection of ice accumulation on wind turbine blades, a significant operational hazard. A quasi-distributed FBG sensing system was implemented on a 1.5 MW turbine, with sensors placed at strategic locations on the blade surface [[7]]. By analyzing the ratio of strain between the leading and trailing edges (the \"shimmy direction\") while the waving-direction strain remained stable, the system could distinguish between icing-induced neutral axis shifts and actual structural damage. Field validation confirmed that the strain ratio dropped to a minimum in February, corresponding to maximum observed ice thickness, demonstrating a highly effective and selective icing detection method [[7]].\n\nThe energy sector, encompassing both traditional and advanced forms, has also embraced FBG technology. In the oil and gas industry, FBGs are used for down-hole monitoring, where they must withstand extreme pressures and temperatures. They are deployed to measure temperature profiles and pressure gradients in wells, providing critical data for optimizing extraction processes [[4]]. In geothermal and steam-assisted gravity drainage applications, FBGs in pure silica-core fibers help monitor temperature distributions, mitigating issues related to hydrogen-induced attenuation [[12]]. Perhaps the most challenging and promising frontier for FBG sensors is in nuclear energy. FBGs are being developed as grid sensors for nuclear thermal hydraulics research, capable of detecting rising bubbles in liquid columns—a novel function that aids in the design and operation of nuclear power stations [[8]]. Furthermore, they are being tested as in-core sensors in reactor experiments, such as those conducted in the MIT reactor, to monitor neutron fluence and temperature in real-time [[10]]. In marine systems, FBGs have been shown to respond to liquid sodium coolant blockages in sodium-cooled fast reactors in less than 500 ms, highlighting their potential for safety-critical applications [[13]].\n\nFinally, the biomedical field has found numerous applications for FBG sensors. Their biocompatibility and optical nature make them suitable for in-vivo measurements. FBGs have been used to monitor physiological parameters, such as tracking heart sounds and measuring strain on the human femur bone, with recorded strains reaching as high as 503.97 µε [[5]]. In addition to clinical applications, FBGs are invaluable tools in biomechanical research, helping to quantify tissue properties and muscle activity. The table below summarizes some of these diverse applications.\n\n| Application Area | Specific Use Case | Technology Involved | Key Challenge(s) Addressed |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Aerospace** | In-situ monitoring of AFP composite manufacturing [[1]] | Embedded FBGs | Process control, defect prevention |\n| **Aerospace** | Fatigue damage detection in advanced composites [[1]] | Surface-mounted or embedded FBGs | Structural integrity, predictive maintenance |\n| **Wind Energy** | Wind turbine blade icing detection [[7]] | Quasi-distributed FBG array | Operational safety, efficiency optimization |\n| **Civil Engineering** | Strain and deformation monitoring in concrete structures [[1,3]] | Embedded FBGs | Structural health assessment, service life prediction |\n| **Energy (Nuclear)** | In-core monitoring of neutron fluence and temperature [[10]] | Radiation-hardened FBGs | Real-time reactor diagnostics, safety |\n| **Energy (Geothermal)** | Temperature monitoring in high-pressure steam wells [[12]] | FBGs in pure silica-core fiber | Hydrogen-induced attenuation, high-T environment |\n| **Biomedical** | Monitoring of human femur bone strain [[5]] | External or implanted FBGs | Biomechanical research, post-operative monitoring |\n| **Biomedical** | Detection of heart sounds [[5]] | Implanted or external FBGs | Non-invasive physiological monitoring |\n\nThese case studies collectively demonstrate that FBG sensors are far more than just point-meters for strain and temperature. They are a versatile and evolving platform that is being adapted to meet the unique demands of a vast array of applications, continuously proving their value in enhancing safety, efficiency, and understanding across a wide spectrum of scientific and industrial domains.",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Despite their numerous advantages and widespread adoption, Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors face a formidable set of challenges that can limit their performance and restrict their deployment in certain applications. The most fundamental of these is the inherent cross-sensitivity between strain and temperature, a consequence of the shared influence of both parameters on the fiber's physical and optical properties [[2,3,5]]. Any external force or thermal fluctuation will cause a combined shift in the Bragg wavelength, making it impossible to determine the magnitude of either parameter from a single FBG measurement alone [[4]]. This necessitates the implementation of decoupling techniques. Several methods have been developed to address this issue. One of the most common is the use of a reference FBG, which is isolated from one of the parameters (e.g., bonded loosely so it is not strained by the substrate) and used to measure the temperature-induced shift, which is then subtracted from the reading of the active sensor [[3,4]]. Another approach involves using dual-wavelength methods or specialized sensor designs, such as hybrid FBG-long period grating sensors, which respond differently to strain and temperature [[1,2]]. Advanced algorithms can also be employed to calculate both parameters simultaneously from a single FBG's response, though this increases system complexity [[4]]. While these methods are effective, they add cost, complexity, and size to the sensing system, representing a trade-off that must be carefully considered in the design phase.\n\nPerhaps the most severe challenge for FBG sensors is their performance in harsh environments, particularly those involving high levels of ionizing radiation, extreme temperatures, or corrosive fluids. In nuclear applications, exposure to gamma rays and neutrons can induce significant changes in the fiber's properties. Ionizing radiation damages the glass lattice, creating color centers and modifying the refractive index, leading to radiation-induced attenuation (RIA) and a shift in the FBG's Bragg wavelength (RI-BWS) [[9,10,15]]. This RI-BWS can be misinterpreted as a temperature or strain change, introducing significant errors. The magnitude of this effect depends strongly on the fiber's composition and the radiation type and dose. Germanium-doped fibers, commonly used for FBG inscription, are highly sensitive, showing redshifts of tens of nanometers after moderate doses [[10]]. In stark contrast, fibers doped with fluorine or nitrogen, or fabricated from pure silica core, exhibit much greater radiation resistance [[9,10,15]]. For instance, regenerated FBGs (RFBGs) fabricated in pre-hydrogenated Ge-doped fibers and annealed at high temperatures showed minimal BWS (<50 pm) even after exposure to 100 kGy of X-rays [[10]]. Femtosecond laser-written Type II gratings in pure silica core fibers sustained very small wavelength shifts (<30 pm) after exposure to extremely high neutron fluences in a reactor core, making them candidates for temperature measurement in extreme radiation environments [[11]].\n\nHigh-temperature stability is another critical hurdle. Standard silica-based FBGs begin to anneal, or lose their refractive index modulation, at temperatures above 800°C, rendering them useless for many industrial applications [[12]]. Research into high-temperature resistant FBGs has focused on two main avenues: developing new materials and improving fabrication techniques. Regenerated FBGs have demonstrated remarkable stability up to 900°C, although this comes at the cost of reduced mechanical strength [[13]]. Even more impressive are sapphire FBGs (SFBGs), which have been shown to operate at temperatures exceeding 1,700°C without degradation [[12]]. These sapphire sensors can be used in conjunction with other techniques, such as blackbody radiation measurement, to achieve dual-strain/temperature sensing at these extreme temperatures [[12]]. The third major challenge relates to long-term reliability and cost. Issues like wavelength drift due to aging and environmental changes can affect sensor functionality over time [[5]]. Furthermore, the system cost associated with high-performance interrogators and specialized FBGs can be prohibitive for some applications, limiting widespread adoption [[2]]. The complexity of designing and installing high-speed, wide-range interrogation systems for dynamic measurements adds another layer of difficulty [[2]]. Addressing these interconnected challenges of cross-sensitivity, harsh-environment tolerance, and overall reliability is the central focus of contemporary FBG research, and solving them will unlock the full potential of this transformative sensing technology.",

      "content": "The future of Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor technology is poised for significant growth and innovation, driven by the convergence of material science, photonics, artificial intelligence, and the ever-increasing demand for smarter, safer, and more efficient systems. The path forward involves addressing the remaining technical challenges while simultaneously exploring entirely new frontiers for application. The concluding remarks of this review synthesize the key findings regarding the current state of the art and outline the emerging trends that will shape the next generation of FBG-based sensing solutions.\n\nOne of the most prominent future directions is the development of next-generation FBGs optimized for extreme environments. The research into radiation-hardened FBGs for nuclear reactors and high-temperature FBGs for gas turbines is a clear indicator of this trend [[9,12,13]]. The focus will continue to shift towards novel materials, such as pure-silica-core fibers, sapphire, and even polymer-based alternatives, which offer superior resilience to harsh conditions [[9,12]]. The use of femtosecond laser inscription will likely become more prevalent, as this technique provides unparalleled control over the grating formation, enabling the creation of devices with enhanced radiation tolerance and thermal stability [[9,12]]. The ultimate goal is to develop \"passive survivable\" sensors that can operate reliably inside a reactor core or deep within the earth, providing real-time feedback that is currently impossible to obtain. This will require not only advances in the FBG itself but also in the coatings and packaging materials that protect it [[3,9]].\n\nAnother critical area of future research is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into the signal processing and interrogation pipeline. The complexity of FBG data, especially from multiplexed arrays or from exotic sensors like TFBGs, presents a fertile ground for ML applications [[14]]. The successful use of deep learning models like SpecExLSTM to improve the accuracy of FWHM estimation from TFBG spectra demonstrates the immense potential of these techniques [[14]]. Future systems will likely employ AI to automate the decoupling of cross-sensitive parameters, to detect subtle patterns indicative of incipient damage in SHM applications, and to enhance the resolution and accuracy of demodulation algorithms [[2,14]]. This symbiosis between advanced hardware and intelligent software will lead to more autonomous and intelligent sensing systems capable of extracting deeper insights from raw sensor data.\n\nFurthermore, the miniaturization and functionalization of FBGs will continue to expand their application space. The development of microstructured fibers, such as photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) and multicore fibers (MCFs), offers new possibilities for creating FBGs with intrinsic properties, such as radiation resistance or multi-parameter sensing capabilities, built directly into the fiber structure [[9,10]]. The application of FBGs to completely new domains, such as advanced chemical and biological sensing, is also an exciting prospect. The high sensitivity of TFBGs to ambient refractive index has already been proven for glucose monitoring, and future work will likely focus on developing sensors for a wider range of biomarkers or hazardous substances [[14]]. The development of Polymer FBGs (PFBGs) also opens up opportunities for flexible electronics and wearable health monitors [[10]].\n\nIn summary, this review has traced the evolution of FBG sensors from a fundamental discovery to a mature and versatile technology. It has explored the core principles that govern their operation, the key milestones that shaped their development, the sophisticated techniques used for their interrogation and multiplexing, and their diverse and impactful applications. While significant challenges related to cross-sensitivity, harsh environments, and cost persist, the trajectory of research indicates a clear and promising path forward. The confluence of material science breakthroughs, advanced fabrication methods like femtosecond laser writing, and the infusion of artificial intelligence promises to overcome these hurdles. The future of FBG technology is one of increased robustness, intelligence, and ubiquity, positioning it to play a pivotal role in the next wave of technological advancements across science, industry, and society.\n\n---",
