      "content": "The field of nanoscience and nanotechnology represents one of the most dynamic and transformative areas of modern research, fundamentally altering our understanding of matter and its applications. The central premise of this discipline is that materials engineered at the nanoscale—typically defined as having at least one external dimension between 1 and 100 nanometers (nm)—exhibit unique physical, chemical, and biological properties that are distinct from their bulk counterparts [[2,9,18]]. This paradigm shift, rooted in the pioneering work of visionaries like Richard Feynman, has unlocked a vast new frontier for innovation across medicine, electronics, energy, agriculture, and consumer goods [[1,14]]. The motivation for this comprehensive review stems from the profound impact these materials have already had and the immense potential they hold for addressing some of the world's most pressing challenges. The ability to precisely control matter at an atomic or molecular scale offers unprecedented opportunities for developing highly efficient drug delivery systems, creating next-generation biosensors for point-of-care diagnostics, engineering regenerative scaffolds for tissue repair, designing potent antimicrobial agents, and enhancing food safety and agricultural productivity [[8,12,13]].\n\nThis review paper aims to provide a systematic and rigorous analysis of the state-of-the-art in nanoparticles and nanostructured materials. Its objectives are threefold: first, to establish a foundational understanding by exploring the historical milestones and key scientific principles that underpin the field; second, to conduct a detailed examination of the current synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and classification schemes that govern the design and fabrication of these materials; and third, to critically evaluate their diverse and expanding applications in bioimaging, biosensing, targeted drug delivery, tissue engineering, antimicrobial therapies, and agro-food sectors. By synthesizing information from a wide range of recent literature, this report seeks to illuminate the remarkable progress made, identify the persistent challenges and open problems, and chart a course for future research directions. The ultimate goal is to present a holistic view of the field, highlighting its synergistic nature where advancements in material science directly enable breakthroughs in life sciences and technology, while simultaneously acknowledging the complex issues of biocompatibility and environmental safety that must be addressed for responsible development and deployment.",

      "content": "The conceptual foundation for nanotechnology was laid decades before the term was coined. In a seminal lecture titled \"There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom,\" delivered on December 29, 1959, physicist Richard Feynman challenged the scientific community to consider the possibility of manipulating individual atoms and molecules [[1,14]]. He envisioned a future where matter could be built from the bottom up, atom by atom, a concept that would later become a cornerstone of the field [[3,13]]. This visionary talk set the intellectual stage for what would become nanotechnology, though it would take another fifteen years for the term itself to enter the lexicon. In 1974, Japanese engineer Norio Taniguchi formally introduced the word \"nanotechnology\" to describe the precision machining and material science involved in working with structures at the nanometer scale [[1,14]]. However, it was not until the 1990s, fueled by revolutionary advances in imaging and analytical technologies, that nanotechnology gained widespread public and scientific recognition [[14]].\n\nThe evolution of the field can be traced through a series of landmark discoveries that progressively expanded our ability to see, understand, and manipulate matter at the smallest scales. One of the earliest known practical applications of nanomaterials dates back to the 4th century CE, with the Lycurgus Cup, a Roman artifact containing an Ag-Au alloy nanoparticle mixture embedded in glass [[1,3,6]]. This cup exhibits dichroism, appearing green in reflected light and red when illuminated from within, a phenomenon caused by localized surface plasmon resonance—a property exclusive to metallic nanoparticles [[1,2]]. Similarly, ancient Egyptians produced lead sulfide (PbS) nanoparticles around 2575 BCE for use as hair dye, and Damascus steel, prized for its strength and beauty, was found centuries later to contain carbon nanotubes and cementite nanowires dispersed within its matrix [[1,14]]. These historical examples demonstrate that humans have interacted with nanomaterials for millennia, often unknowingly, without fully comprehending the underlying science.\n\nThe scientific study of nanoparticles began to take shape in the 19th century. In 1857, the prolific chemist Michael Faraday synthesized stable colloidal gold, meticulously documenting its unique optical properties and laying the groundwork for the field of plasmonics [[1,14]]. Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion provided a theoretical framework for estimating the size of molecules, including sugar, which he calculated to be approximately 1 nm in diameter [[14]]. A major leap forward came in 1981 with the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 [[1]]. The STM enabled scientists not only to visualize individual atoms on a surface but also to manipulate them, as famously demonstrated in 1990 when Don Eigler used the STM tip to move xenon atoms to spell out \"IBM\" [[1]]. This marked the first time matter had been moved at the atomic level, providing a powerful tool for top-down nanofabrication. Further discoveries solidified the foundation of modern nanomaterials. The C60 buckminsterfullerene, or \"buckyball,\" was discovered in 1985, earning its discoverers a Nobel Prize in 1996 [[1,3]]. The subsequent discovery of carbon nanotubes by Sumio Iijima in 1991 and graphene by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov in 2004, who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010, respectively, opened up entirely new classes of carbon-based nanomaterials with extraordinary properties [[1,3]].\n\nThese fundamental discoveries created a fertile ground for the establishment of large-scale, coordinated efforts to advance the field. In 2000, the United States government announced the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), a multi-agency program designed to coordinate federal nanotechnology research and development. The NNI was signed into law in 2003 and has since played a pivotal role in funding and guiding the field [[1]]. The U.S. investment in the NNI grew dramatically, from $464 million in fiscal year 2001 to approximately $6.2 billion by 2019 [[14]]. Other nations followed suit, with the European Union increasing its investment from around $1.5–$1.8 billion between 2005 and 2010 to over $3–$4 billion by 2019-2020 [[14]]. This sustained global investment has catalyzed a rapid expansion of the nanotechnology sector. The global nanotechnology market was estimated at $42.2 billion in 2020, with projections to reach $70.7 billion by 2026 [[14]]. Concurrently, the nanomaterials market alone was valued at $8.0 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.1% through 2028 [[14]]. This economic momentum reflects the transition of nanotechnology from pure research to applied science, with over 1,800 nanotechnology-based consumer products commercialized by 2014 and applications ranging from Tata's Nano car to Logitech's solar-powered keyboard [[14]].\n\n| **Historical Milestone** | **Year** | **Key Figure(s)** | **Significance** | **Relevant Citations** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Feynman's Lecture \"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom\" | 1959 | Richard Feynman | Laid the conceptual foundation for nanotechnology and atomic-scale manipulation. | [[1,3,14]] |\n| First Use of Term \"Nanotechnology\" | 1974 | Norio Taniguchi | Coined the term to describe precision machining at the nanometer scale. | [[1,14]] |\n| Discovery of Fullerenes (C60) | 1985 | Kroto, Curl, Smalley | Discovered a new class of carbon nanomaterials, leading to a Nobel Prize in 1996. | [[1,3]] |\n| Discovery of Carbon Nanotubes | 1991 | Sumio Iijima | Uncovered one-dimensional carbon nanostructures with exceptional mechanical and electronic properties. | [[1]] |\n| Discovery of Graphene | 2004 | Geim, Novoselov | Isolated a two-dimensional material with extraordinary conductivity and strength, earning a Nobel Prize in 2010. | [[1,3]] |\n| Invention of Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) | 1981 | Binnig, Rohrer | Enabled visualization and manipulation of individual atoms, a key tool for top-down nanofabrication. | [[1]] |\n| Synthesis of Ruby Gold Colloids | 1857 | Michael Faraday | Provided the first systematic study of nanoparticle optical properties. | [[1,14]] |\n| Establishment of US National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) | 2000 | Bill Clinton | Launched a coordinated federal R&D effort that significantly accelerated nanotechnology research. | [[1,14]] |",

      "content": "A clear understanding of the fundamental concepts, classifications, and characterization techniques is essential for navigating the complex landscape of nanoparticles and nanostructured materials. At its core, a nanoparticle (NP) is defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as a nano-object with all external dimensions in the size range of approximately 1 to 100 nanometers [[2,13]]. Some definitions extend this upper limit to 1,000 nm, particularly for colloidal particles like liposomes [[7]]. The defining feature of this scale is that as particle size decreases, the ratio of surface area to volume increases dramatically [[2,9]]. This high surface-to-volume ratio means that a greater proportion of atoms reside on the surface, leading to enhanced reactivity and altered physical and chemical properties compared to the bulk material [[2,18]]. Two primary effects are responsible for these unique behaviors: surface effects and quantum confinement [[2]].\n\nSurface effects dominate the properties of nanoparticles, especially those below 100 nm. With a higher concentration of atoms at the surface, phenomena such as increased surface energy, catalytic activity, and chemical reactivity become pronounced [[2]]. For instance, a 3 nm gold nanoparticle melts at a temperature 300°C lower than bulk gold due to these surface forces [[2]]. Quantum confinement becomes significant as particle dimensions approach the exciton Bohr radius, typically in zero-dimensional (0-D) nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm [[17]]. In this regime, the motion of electrons and holes is restricted in all three spatial dimensions, leading to the discretization of electronic energy levels [[17]]. This effect is exploited in quantum dots, whose bandgap—and thus their color and fluorescence—are precisely tunable by controlling their size [[13]].\n\nNanostructured materials are classified based on several criteria, including dimensionality, composition, and origin. Dimensionality describes the number of spatial directions in which a structure extends at the nanoscale.\n*   **0-D (Zero-Dimensional):** These are discrete nanoparticles with dimensions confined in all three directions. Examples include quantum dots, fullerenes (C60), dendrimers, and nanodiamonds [[2,4,13,17]].\n*   **1-D (One-Dimensional):** These structures have one dimension at the nanoscale and two extended dimensions. They include nanowires, nanorods, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and nanobelts [[2,4,18]].\n*   **2-D (Two-Dimensional):** These are sheets or layers with thickness at the nanoscale but extended in two dimensions. Prominent examples are graphene, MXenes, and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) [[4,14,16]].\n*   **3-D (Three-Dimensional):** These are larger structures composed of nanoscale building blocks, such as nanowire bundles, porous scaffolds, and core-shell nanoparticles [[4,14]].\n\nCompositionally, nanomaterials are broadly categorized into organic and inorganic types. Organic nanomaterials include polymers (e.g., chitosan, PLGA), lipids (e.g., liposomes, lipid nanoparticles), carbohydrates (e.g., cyclodextrins), and proteins (e.g., albumin, viruses) [[2,8,13]]. Inorganic nanomaterials encompass metals (e.g., Au, Ag, Fe), ceramics (e.g., TiO₂, SiO₂), and semiconductors [[2,7,8]]. A hybrid category includes polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs), which are synthesized from preceramic polymers and reinforced with nanofillers like CNTs or graphene [[22]].\n\nThe origin of a nanomaterial further classifies it as natural (NONPs), incidental, or engineered [[6,9,14]]. Natural nanomaterials exist in the environment and living organisms, such as DNA (2–2.5 nm), enzymes (3–7 nm), cellulose nanofibers (20–40 nm), and magnetite nanocrystals in bacteria [[6,14]]. Incidental nanoparticles are unintentional byproducts of combustion processes, such as welding fumes or soot [[6,9]]. Engineered nanoparticles are deliberately synthesized for specific applications, using methods like top-down or bottom-up fabrication [[6,9]].\n\nCharacterizing these diverse materials requires a suite of sophisticated analytical techniques. Morphology and size are routinely assessed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) [[2,24]]. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) analyses are used to determine surface area and pore size distribution [[2]]. Crystallinity and elemental composition are determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [[2,24]]. Optical properties are studied with UV-visible absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, while magnetic properties are measured using vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) or superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry [[2,24]]. Thermal stability is evaluated with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) [[2]]. More advanced methods, such as multi-wavelength analytical ultracentrifugation (MWL-AUC), are being developed to characterize complex, multi-dimensional particle size distributions with high precision [[5]]. This comprehensive toolkit is indispensable for correlating a nanoparticle's structure and composition to its functional performance.",

      "content": "The synthesis of nanoparticles is a critical step that dictates their final properties, functionality, and suitability for specific applications. The field has evolved from simple chemical reduction methods to highly sophisticated, programmable, and environmentally conscious fabrication routes. Broadly, these methods can be categorized into two main approaches: top-down and bottom-up [[1,9]]. Top-down methods involve reducing the size of larger, bulk materials to the nanoscale through processes like lithography, milling, laser ablation, and sputtering [[1,9]]. While effective for creating precise patterns, these methods are often material-intensive and less ideal for producing free-standing nanoparticles in high yield. In contrast, bottom-up methods build nanostructures atom-by-atom or molecule-by-molecule, offering greater control over particle size, shape, and composition [[9]]. These methods include chemical vapor deposition (CVD), sol-gel processing, microemulsion, and various wet-chemical techniques [[13,14]].\n\nA significant trend in modern nanomaterial synthesis is the shift towards green chemistry and sustainable practices, often referred to as biogenic or green synthesis [[2,12]]. This approach leverages the reducing and stabilizing capabilities of biological entities, primarily plant extracts and microorganisms, to synthesize nanoparticles in aqueous solutions under mild conditions [[12]]. This method is considered more eco-friendly and cost-effective compared to traditional chemical or physical methods, which often require harsh chemicals, high temperatures, and pressures [[2,12]]. Numerous studies have successfully demonstrated the biosynthesis of silver (Ag) and gold (Au) nanoparticles using extracts from plants like *Trichoderma koningii*, *Eucalyptus globulus*, *Ceropegia thwaitesii*, and *Ageratum conyzoides* [[2,12,19]]. Microbial systems, such as the fungus *Fusarium oxysporum* and the yeast *Saccharomyces boulardii*, have also been employed for the extracellular synthesis of nanoparticles [[19]]. The choice of plant extract or microorganism can influence the morphology and stability of the resulting nanoparticles, opening up avenues for tailored synthesis [[19]].\n\nBeyond conventional bulk synthesis, a new frontier in nanofabrication focuses on the direct assembly of nanoparticles onto substrates, a process known as *in situ* substrate growth [[21]]. This bottom-up technique circumvents the need for separate colloidal synthesis and subsequent transfer steps like ligand exchange, simplifying the fabrication of devices such as sensors and catalysts [[21]]. By carefully controlling parameters like reagent concentration, pH, and temperature, researchers can achieve precise geometrical and spatial control over the grown nanostructures, forming features like nanostars or SERS-active substrates directly on the target surface [[21]]. Another highly advanced bottom-up strategy is DNA-mediated self-assembly, which harnesses the programmability and specificity of DNA base pairing to construct complex, multidimensional nanoarchitectures [[20]]. Pioneering work by Nadrian Seeman in the 1980s laid the groundwork for DNA nanotechnology, culminating in the development of DNA origami, where a long single-stranded DNA scaffold is folded into user-defined shapes using shorter staple strands [[1,20]]. This technique allows for the precise arrangement of other nanomaterials, such as gold nanoparticles, into functional plasmonic arrays or 3D cages for drug delivery, representing a pinnacle of molecular-level control [[20]].\n\nFurthermore, the creation of core-shell nanoparticles represents a sophisticated synthetic strategy to combine the desirable properties of multiple materials while mitigating their individual drawbacks [[25]]. In this architecture, a core material is encapsulated by a shell of a different composition [[24,25]]. For example, a magnetic iron oxide (Fe₃O₄) core can be coated with a biocompatible silica or gold shell, creating a multifunctional nanoparticle suitable for both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast and drug delivery [[25]]. The shell can serve multiple purposes: it can reduce the cytotoxicity of the core material, improve dispersion in biological fluids, and provide reactive sites for conjugating targeting ligands [[25]]. An example synthesis involves growing a cobalt-gold (Co@Au) core-shell structure via microemulsion, followed by surface modification with 2-aminoethanethiol and conjugation of the anticancer drug methotrexate for targeted therapy [[24]]. Similarly, hydrogel-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) can be designed with stimuli-responsive shells that release their therapeutic payload in response to changes in temperature or pH, enabling smart, triggered drug delivery [[27]]. These advanced fabrication techniques are pushing the boundaries of what is possible, transforming nanoparticles from simple cargo carriers into intelligent, programmable nanosystems.",

      "content": "The unique optical, magnetic, and electronic properties of nanoparticles have revolutionized the fields of bioimaging and biosensing, enabling unprecedented sensitivity, specificity, and multiplexing capabilities. These applications leverage the ability of engineered nanomaterials to act as highly efficient probes and signal transducers, bridging the gap between molecular biology and clinical diagnostics.\n\nIn bioimaging, nanoparticles serve as powerful contrast agents for non-invasive visualization of biological structures and processes. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the most prominent modalities enhanced by nanotechnology. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), typically composed of magnetite (Fe₃O₄) or maghemite (γ-Fe₂O₃), are widely used as T2-weighted contrast agents [[7]]. Their strong magnetic moment causes local distortions in the magnetic field, shortening the relaxation time of surrounding water protons and generating a dark signal on the MRI image [[7]]. To improve biocompatibility and add functionality, these SPIONs are often coated with a silica or polymer shell. For instance, amphiphilic Fe-Pt nanoparticles have been developed as T2 contrast agents, while cysteamine-capped Fe-Pt nanoparticles can enhance both CT and MRI contrast [[7]]. Core-shell designs allow for dual-modality imaging; Fe-Pt/SiO₂/FITC nanoparticles, for example, combine magnetic resonance imaging with fluorescence imaging for multimodal detection [[7]]. Beyond MRI, fluorescent nanoparticles offer bright, stable alternatives to traditional organic dyes. Quantum dots (QDs), which exhibit size-tunable fluorescence, have been modified with targeting moieties like folic acid for specific bioimaging [[7]]. Safer, carbon-based alternatives like carbon dots have also been developed [[2,13]]. Plasmonic nanoparticles, such as gold nanorods, can be detected by their characteristic optical backscattering spectrum, allowing for the unambiguous determination of their length and diameter distributions [[5]].\n\nBiosensors represent another critical application area where nanoparticles play a pivotal role. A biosensor generally consists of a bioreceptor, a transducer, and a signal processor [[7]]. Nanomaterials excel as transducers, converting a biochemical interaction into a quantifiable signal. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are frequently used in electrochemical biosensors due to their excellent conductivity and ease of surface functionalization [[10]]. When biomolecules bind to the AuNP surface, it induces a change in electrical properties, such as impedance, which can be measured with high sensitivity. This principle is used in wearable sweat sensors for real-time health monitoring [[11]]. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are also functionalized to detect biomarkers like glucose, calcium ions, and even entire viruses [[10]]. For instance, CNTs have been functionalized to detect prostate-specific antigens, demonstrating their potential for cancer diagnostics [[10]]. Other nanomaterials are also finding use in bioelectronics. Programmable materials based on N-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAM) polymers can be used to create thermally responsive hydrogels for sensing applications [[10]]. Furthermore, DNA-based nanostructures are being integrated into biosensors. Tetrahedral DNA nanostructures, for example, can be designed to undergo a conformational change upon binding a target analyte, which can then be detected optically or electrically [[10]].\n\nThe table below summarizes some of the key nanoparticle types and their specific applications in bioimaging and biosensing.\n\n| Nanoparticle Type | Composition/Structure | Primary Bioimaging/Biosensing Application | Key Properties Utilized | Relevant Citations |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs)** | Magnetite (Fe₃O₄) / Maghemite (γ-Fe₂O₃) | T2-weighted MRI Contrast Agents | High magnetic susceptibility, superparamagnetism | [[7,15]] |\n| **Gold Nanoparticles (GNPs)** | Gold (Au) | Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), Electrochemical Biosensors, Photothermal Therapy | Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR), High Conductivity | [[7,10,21]] |\n| **Quantum Dots (QDs)** | Semiconductor (e.g., CdS, InP) | Fluorescent Bioimaging, Multiplexed Detection | Size-tunable, narrow emission spectra, high photostability | [[2,7,13]] |\n| **Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs)** | Carbon (SWNTs, MWNTs) | Electrochemical Sensors for Biomarkers (Glucose, Ca²⁺) | High aspect ratio, excellent electrical conductivity | [[10,13]] |\n| **DNA Origami Nanostructures** | DNA | Biosensing, Precise Nanoparticle Arrangement | Programmability, structural stability, biocompatibility | [[1,10,20]] |\n| **Core-Shell Nanoparticles** | e.g., Fe₃O₄/Au, Fe-Pt/SiO₂/FITC | Multifunctional/Multimodal Imaging (MRI + Fluorescence/CT) | Combination of magnetic and optical properties | [[7,25]] |\n| **Polymer-Derived Ceramics (PDCs)** | SiC, SiOC, etc. | Drug Delivery, Bio-imaging (SiOC shows favorable cytocompatibility) | High thermal stability, hierarchical porosity, biocompatibility | [[22]] |\n\nThese applications are increasingly moving towards point-of-care diagnostics and personalized medicine. Lab-on-a-chip devices incorporating nanobiosensors promise rapid, low-cost analysis outside of centralized laboratories [[13]]. The integration of nanomaterials with wearable technology, such as in micromotors or flexible sensors, opens up possibilities for continuous, real-time health monitoring [[11]]. The ongoing challenge remains to ensure the long-term stability, biocompatibility, and reproducibility of these nanoscale devices, but the trajectory is clear: nanoparticles are becoming integral components of the next generation of medical diagnostics.",

      "content": "The application of nanoparticles in therapeutics represents one of the most promising and clinically impactful domains of nanomedicine, offering solutions to longstanding challenges in drug efficacy, toxicity, and delivery. The field is broadly divided into two major areas: targeted drug delivery and antimicrobial systems. Both leverage the unique physicochemical properties of nanomaterials to achieve outcomes that are difficult or impossible with conventional treatments.\n\nTargeted drug delivery systems aim to transport therapeutic agents directly to disease sites, such as tumors, while minimizing exposure to healthy tissues. This approach enhances therapeutic efficacy and reduces systemic side effects. A key enabling concept in passive targeting is the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, a phenomenon observed in solid tumors where leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage allow nanoparticles to accumulate preferentially in tumor tissue [[13]]. Several FDA-approved nanoformulations exemplify the clinical success of this approach. Doxil® is a liposomal formulation of the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (~100 nm) used to treat ovarian and breast cancers, while Abraxane™ is an albumin-bound form of paclitaxel (~130 nm) approved for metastatic breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer [[12,13]]. These formulations utilize lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) and protein-based nanoparticles, respectively, which are biocompatible and biodegradable [[12,13]].\n\nTo achieve active targeting, nanoparticles are functionalized with specific ligands (e.g., antibodies, peptides, aptamers) that recognize and bind to receptors overexpressed on the surface of diseased cells. For example, Co@Au nanoparticles have been conjugated with methotrexate to target cancer cells [[24]]. Stimuli-responsive systems represent another advanced strategy, designed to release their payload in response to specific triggers present at the disease site. Thermally responsive hydrogels based on PNIPAM change their conformation at a lower critical solution temperature (~32°C), releasing drugs in response to localized hyperthermia [[10]]. Dual-targeted delivery systems combine both active targeting ligands and stimuli-responsive mechanisms for even greater precision [[15]]. Theranostics, a portmanteau of \"therapy\" and \"diagnostics,\" is an emerging paradigm where a single nanoparticle serves a dual purpose: delivering therapy and simultaneously monitoring the treatment's progress via imaging [[13,15]]. For instance, a core-shell nanoparticle might have a magnetic core for MRI guidance, a fluorescent shell for optical tracking, and a drug-loaded cavity for treatment [[25]]. Clinical trials are actively exploring these advanced systems, such as DCR-MYC (a siRNA-LNP targeting MYC oncogene) and MRX34 (a miRNA-liposomal injection), underscoring the translational potential of nanomedicine [[15]].\n\nIn parallel, nanoparticles are being engineered as powerful antimicrobial agents to combat the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, often referred to as ESKAPEE pathogens (e.g., MRSA, Acinetobacter baumannii). Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are among the most studied for their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria (*E. coli*, *S. aureus*), fungi, and viruses [[12,18]]. Their mechanism of action is multifaceted, involving disruption of the microbial cell membrane, interference with quorum sensing to inhibit biofilm formation, and induction of oxidative stress through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [[12]]. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) also show antimicrobial and anticancer properties, particularly when synthesized through green methods [[12,13]]. Chitosan nanoparticles, derived from a natural polysaccharide, are also being explored for their antibacterial effects [[10]]. A novel approach combines nanomaterials with other advanced materials, such as combining chitosan nanofibers with MXenes, which showed efficacy against MRSA and other ESKAPEE pathogens [[10]]. Star polymers with cationic cores have demonstrated potent antibiofilm activity against *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *S. aureus* [[10]]. Beyond standalone nanoparticles, nanomaterials are also being incorporated into surfaces and coatings. For instance, incorporating TiO₂ and Ag NPs into food packaging films provides antimicrobial properties that can extend the shelf-life of minced meat from 2 to 7 days at 4°C [[2]]. Similarly, ZrO₂ NPs have shown antibacterial effects against *E. coli* [[8]]. The versatility and potency of these nanomaterial-based antimicrobials make them a crucial area of research in the fight against infectious diseases.",

      "content": "The application of nanoparticles extends beyond the confines of medicine, with significant potential to address critical challenges in agriculture and the food industry. Here, nanotechnology offers innovative solutions for improving crop yields, ensuring food safety, and developing sustainable agricultural practices. The primary applications fall into two main categories: the use of nanomaterials as nanofertilizers and nanopesticides to enhance nutrient uptake and protect crops, and their use as active agents in food packaging to extend shelf-life and prevent contamination [[2,8]].\n\nIn agriculture, nanoparticles are being investigated as nanofertilizers to deliver essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium directly to plant roots with high efficiency, thereby minimizing waste and environmental runoff. Silica (SiO₂), zinc oxide (ZnO), and copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles have been identified as promising candidates for this purpose [[2]]. These nanomaterials can increase soil fertility and support nutrient transport within plants [[6]]. In addition to fertilization, nanoparticles are being explored as nanopesticides to provide targeted protection against pests and pathogens. Silver (Ag), titanium dioxide (TiO₂), and copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles are commonly cited for their pesticidal properties [[2]]. TiO₂ nanoparticles, for example, can be used in photodynamic therapy (PDT), where they generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) under visible light to kill target cells, a principle that can be adapted for pest control [[7]]. Studies have shown that Au, Ag, and Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles exhibited low or zero toxicity in germination tests at doses up to 116 μg/mL, suggesting that careful selection and dose optimization are crucial for safe agricultural use [[23]]. The development of such nanotechnologies could lead to reduced reliance on conventional chemical pesticides, promoting more sustainable and environmentally friendly farming practices.\n\nIn the food industry, the primary application of nanoparticles is in active food packaging. Incorporating nanomaterials into packaging films imparts functional properties that help preserve food quality and safety. Silver (Ag) and titanium dioxide (TiO₂) nanoparticles are frequently used for their potent antimicrobial activity [[2,8]]. When embedded in a polymer film, these nanoparticles can slowly release ions or generate ROS, inhibiting the growth of spoilage microorganisms and pathogens on the food surface. This can significantly extend the shelf-life of perishable goods. A notable case study demonstrated that incorporating TiO₂ and Ag NPs into minced meat packaging extended its shelf-life from just 2 days to 7 days when stored at 4°C [[2]]. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles are also used for similar purposes [[2,8]]. However, the use of nanoparticles in food contact materials raises important questions about migration from the packaging into the food and potential human consumption. Therefore, extensive safety and toxicological assessments are required before widespread adoption.\n\nWhile the potential benefits are substantial, the application of nanomaterials in agro-food systems is not without risks. The environmental fate and behavior of nanoparticles in soil and water ecosystems are critical unknowns. There is concern about their accumulation in the environment, potential toxicity to non-target organisms like soil microbes, and their entry into the food chain [[2,14]]. For instance, TiO₂ nanoparticles have been shown to trigger gene expression changes linked to inflammation and proliferation in rat cells [[23]]. Similarly, studies on aquatic toxicity have reported adverse effects on organisms like zebrafish embryos [[14]]. Addressing these environmental and human health concerns is paramount for the responsible development of nanotechnology in the agro-food sector. Future research will need to focus on designing biodegradable or environmentally benign nanomaterials, understanding their long-term ecological impact, and establishing robust regulatory frameworks to ensure their safe use. Machine learning models are already beginning to be used to predict the ecotoxicity of nanomaterials, helping to guide safer design choices [[23]].",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Despite the remarkable progress and vast potential of nanoparticles and nanostructured materials, their translation from laboratory research to widespread clinical and industrial applications is fraught with significant challenges and open problems. These hurdles span technical, biological, and regulatory domains, demanding continued interdisciplinary research and collaboration to overcome. A central and recurring challenge is the issue of biocompatibility and toxicity. The same properties that make nanoparticles effective—for instance, their high surface reactivity and ability to cross biological barriers—can also render them potentially harmful [[2,23]]. The toxicity of a nanoparticle is not inherent to its material but is a complex function of multiple variables, including its size, shape, surface charge, crystallinity, aggregation state, and surface functionalization [[14]]. For example, smaller nanoparticles tend to exhibit higher toxicity due to their larger surface-area-to-volume ratio [[12]]. Studies have shown that 5 nm Ag nanoparticles can induce genotoxicity in human cells, while 1 nm Pt nanoparticles can induce autophagy in placental cells [[23]]. Long-term accumulation of nanoparticles in vital organs like the liver and spleen is another major concern, with potential links to chronic inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases [[14,25]].\n\nAnother critical open problem is the lack of standardized testing protocols and scalable manufacturing processes. Achieving consistent quality, reproducibility, and purity for engineered nanoparticles on an industrial scale remains a formidable task [[13]]. Without standardized methods for synthesis and characterization, comparing results across different studies becomes difficult, hindering the validation and clinical translation of nanomedicines [[13]]. The complexity of characterizing nanoparticles is compounded by the fact that they often exist as polydisperse populations, making traditional one-dimensional characterization insufficient to describe their full properties [[5]]. This necessitates the development of advanced, multi-dimensional characterization techniques, which are still evolving [[5]]. The scalability of green synthesis methods, while environmentally attractive, is also a subject of ongoing research [[12]].\n\nNavigating the regulatory landscape presents another layer of complexity. Regulatory bodies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) are still developing frameworks to assess the safety and efficacy of nanotechnology-based products [[13,14]]. The existing regulations for bulk chemicals and conventional pharmaceuticals may not be adequate for nanoparticles, whose properties can differ significantly at the nanoscale. This creates uncertainty for developers and slows down the approval process [[13]]. Establishing clear guidelines for labeling, risk assessment, and post-market surveillance of nanotechnology products is an urgent priority.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a concerted effort focused on predictive modeling and risk assessment. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence are emerging as powerful tools to accelerate the development of safer nanomaterials. ML models have shown high predictive power in forecasting the toxicity of nanoparticles based on their physicochemical properties. For instance, Random Forest models have achieved accuracies of 93.45% for Au NP toxicity and 99.47% for ZnO NP toxicity [[23]]. Such models can help researchers screen for potentially hazardous materials early in the design phase, reducing the need for costly and time-consuming experimental testing. Similarly, AI-driven design platforms are being developed to create novel nanomaterials with optimized functions, bypassing the trial-and-error nature of traditional synthesis [[13]]. Overcoming the current challenges will require a multidisciplinary approach that integrates material science, biology, toxicology, engineering, and data science to develop a deep, quantitative understanding of the structure-activity-toxicity relationships in nanomaterials. Only through this comprehensive understanding can we unlock the full potential of nanotechnology while ensuring its safe and responsible advancement.\n\n---",
