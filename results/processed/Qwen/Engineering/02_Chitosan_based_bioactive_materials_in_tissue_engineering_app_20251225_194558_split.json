      "content": "Chitosan, a linear polysaccharide composed of randomly distributed β-(1→4)-linked D-glucosamine (deacetylated unit) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (acetylated unit), has emerged as a cornerstone biomaterial in the field of regenerative medicine [[13,15]]. Its unique combination of biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity, and inherent biological activity positions it as a highly promising alternative to synthetic polymers for tissue engineering applications [[18,23]]. Derived from chitin, the second most abundant natural polymer on Earth after cellulose, which itself is found in the exoskeletons of crustaceans and insects and the cell walls of fungi, chitosan represents a renewable and sustainable resource [[14,18]]. The process of its creation involves the alkaline deacetylation of chitin, a transformation that imparts upon the resulting polymer a suite of properties essential for biomedical use [[3,15]]. The history of chitosan's discovery dates back to 1811 when French chemist Henri Braconnot first identified it in mushrooms; however, it was not until later work by Rouget in 1859 that purified forms were isolated from fungi and mushrooms [[14,15]]. The modern understanding of chitosan and its applications began to take shape in the mid-20th century, with early documented uses in wound healing, hemostasis, and sutures between the 1960s and 1980s [[23]].\n\nThe fundamental properties of chitosan are dictated primarily by two key structural parameters: its molecular weight (MW) and its degree of deacetylation (DD), also referred to as the degree of acetylation (DA) [[6,24]]. The DD, which must be greater than 50% for a polymer to be classified as chitosan, determines the density of free amino groups along the polymer backbone [[4,15]]. These primary amine groups are protonated at acidic pH levels (typically below pH 6.5), conferring a net positive charge to the molecule [[4,14]]. This polycationic nature is central to many of chitosan's bioactive functions, including its ability to interact electrostatically with negatively charged molecules such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), proteins, and nucleic acids, thereby influencing protein adsorption, cellular behavior, and drug delivery [[11,13,15]]. Commercially available chitosan typically has a DD ranging from 60% to 90%, with higher values correlating with slower degradation rates and enhanced mechanical strength [[12,24]]. The MW, which can range from hundreds of thousands to over a million Daltons, also profoundly influences its physical and biological characteristics; high MW chitosan (>100 kDa) generally provides superior film-forming properties and mechanical integrity, whereas low MW chitosan (<100 kDa) often exhibits enhanced antimicrobial activity and solubility due to better interaction with cell membranes [[4,10,18]]. However, this very same polycationic property presents a significant challenge, as it leads to poor or no solubility in neutral and basic aqueous solutions, severely limiting its direct application in physiological environments [[4,12,18]].\n\nDespite these limitations, chitosan possesses an impressive array of intrinsic biological functionalities. It is renowned for its broad-spectrum antimicrobial and antifungal activities, which arise from the interaction of its positively charged amino groups with the negatively charged components of microbial cell surfaces, leading to membrane disruption, leakage of intracellular contents, and ultimately, cell death [[11,18,25]]. Furthermore, chitosan has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunoenhancing properties, making it a multifunctional material [[18,23]]. In the context of tissue engineering, these properties are harnessed to create scaffolds that mimic the native extracellular matrix (ECM), providing a supportive framework for cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation [[3,20]]. These scaffolds facilitate nutrient transport and controlled degradation, ideally at a rate that matches the formation of new tissue, while inducing a minimal inflammatory response from the host [[3]]. Consequently, chitosan-based materials have been explored for a wide spectrum of regenerative medicine applications, including but not limited to bone, cartilage, skin, neural, vascular, liver, and muscle regeneration [[3,20]]. While only a few chitosan-based products, predominantly for wound healing, have achieved widespread clinical use, the field continues to advance rapidly through sophisticated material design and fabrication techniques [[13,21]]. This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state-of-the-art of chitosan-based bioactive materials, examining their fundamental chemistry, advanced fabrication methods, diverse applications, persistent challenges, and future research trajectories.",

      "content": "The utility of chitosan in tissue engineering is rooted in a distinct set of chemical and physical properties that can be precisely tuned to meet the demands of specific biomedical applications. Understanding these properties and the factors that govern them is critical for designing effective chitosan-based biomaterials. The two most influential parameters are the Degree of Deacetylation (DD) and the Molecular Weight (MW), both of which dictate the polymer's solubility, mechanical strength, and biological interactions [[6,12,24]]. The DD refers to the percentage of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine units converted to d-glucosamine units during the deacetylation process [[4]]. As previously noted, a DD greater than 50% is required for a polymer to be considered chitosan [[4]]. This parameter is paramount because it controls the density of free amine (-NH2) groups along the polymer chain. At acidic pH (e.g., acetic acid, pH < 6.5), these amine groups become protonated (-NH3+), rendering the polymer polycationic [[4,6,14]]. This positive charge is the source of many of chitosan's biofunctions, including its antimicrobial effect, its ability to form polyelectrolyte complexes with anionic molecules like DNA and GAGs, and its influence on protein adsorption and subsequent cell behavior [[11,13,15]]. Higher DD values generally correlate with stronger polycationic character, leading to improved antimicrobial activity, enhanced mucoadhesion, and greater mechanical strength in films and gels [[18,24]]. For instance, studies have shown that chitosan with a DD of 81.6% exhibited higher antimicrobial activity against *S. aureus* compared to a lower DD variant [[18]]. However, a higher DD also results in slower enzymatic degradation by lysozyme and other endogenous enzymes, potentially extending the material's persistence in the body [[11,24]].\n\nThe Molecular Weight (MW) of chitosan is another defining characteristic that significantly impacts its performance. MW is typically reported in kilodaltons (kDa) and can vary widely, from around 89 kDa for low-MW chitosan to over 4,000 kDa for high-MW variants [[10,22]]. High-MW chitosan (>100 kDa) tends to form more robust and mechanically stable films and hydrogels, which is advantageous for applications requiring structural support, such as load-bearing bone scaffolds [[20,22]]. Conversely, low-MW chitosan (<100 kDa) is more soluble and has been associated with superior antimicrobial efficacy due to its ability to penetrate bacterial cell membranes more effectively [[10,18]]. MW also influences cytotoxicity; one study found that chitosan prepared using CO2 saturation had approximately 2.5 times higher cell viability in L929 fibroblast assays compared to chitosan dissolved in lactic acid, suggesting that processing methods that preserve higher MW may yield more biocompatible materials [[10]]. The natural origin of chitosan means that even within a single commercial grade, there can be variability in MW distribution, monomer sequence, and overall structure, which contributes to batch-to-batch variations in performance [[12]].\n\nThese fundamental properties give rise to several key bioactive functions. The polycationic nature enables chitosan to act as a hemostatic agent by promoting erythrocyte agglutination and platelet adhesion, accelerating blood clotting [[25]]. It also plays a crucial role in gene delivery, where it can condense negatively charged DNA or siRNA into protective nanoparticles, shielding them from nuclease degradation and facilitating their uptake by cells [[18]]. The antimicrobial activity of chitosan is well-documented and is influenced by DD, MW, pH, and the specific microorganism [[11,18]]. Proposed mechanisms include binding to fungal DNA, chelation of essential metal ions, and blocking nutrient uptake [[18]]. For example, quaternized chitosan derivatives show potent activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria [[18]]. Beyond these inherent properties, chitosan's surface can be further modified to enhance its functionality. Derivatization strategies, such as phosphorylation, can increase water solubility across a wider pH range and dramatically improve transfection efficiency for gene delivery applications [[20]]. Other modifications, like carboxymethylation or sulphonation, can introduce negative charges, enabling the creation of novel polyelectrolyte complexes [[4,20]]. Ultimately, the versatility of chitosan stems from its tunable nature, allowing researchers to tailor its properties—from mechanical strength and degradation rate to surface charge and bioactivity—to suit the specific requirements of a given tissue engineering construct.\n\n| Property | Description | Impact on Tissue Engineering Applications | Citations |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Degree of Deacetylation (DD)** | Percentage of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine units converted to d-glucosamine.

      "content": "The journey of chitosan from a laboratory curiosity to a premier biomaterial in tissue engineering is marked by a series of pivotal discoveries and technological advancements spanning nearly two centuries. The story begins with its initial identification in 1811 by French chemist Henri Braconnot, who termed the substance \"fungine\" after isolating it from mushrooms [[14]]. A decade later, in 1859, the French scientist Rouget successfully isolated a purer form from fungi and mushrooms, coining the name \"chitosan,\" derived from the Greek word *chiton*, meaning \"to armor\" [[14,15]]. Despite these early discoveries, the potential of chitosan remained largely unexplored for many decades. The true groundwork for its biomedical application was laid in the mid-20th century. Research into chitin and its derivatives accelerated, particularly in the Soviet Union, where its hemostatic and antimicrobial properties were investigated for military and medical use [[23]]. This foundational work established chitosan as a material with tangible bioactive functions, setting the stage for its broader adoption.\n\nThe first half of the 20th century saw the introduction of chitosan-based products into clinical practice. Early applications focused on its well-known hemostatic and antimicrobial capabilities. By the 1960s and 1980s, chitosan was being used in the form of sutures, wound dressings, and topical formulations for wound healing and dermatological conditions [[12,23]]. These initial products, though simple, proved the concept that chitosan could be safely used in the human body and provided therapeutic benefits. However, progress was relatively slow, constrained by the limited understanding of its complex structure-property relationships and the available fabrication technologies. A major inflection point occurred with the advent of nanotechnology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. From the 1990s onwards, advances in material science enabled the development of more sophisticated chitosan-based systems, such as nanoparticles and nanofibers, which could more closely mimic the intricate architecture of the natural extracellular matrix [[23]]. This era also saw the emergence of hydrogels, which could be designed to release therapeutic agents in a controlled manner, opening up new avenues for localized drug delivery [[23]].\n\nA transformative period began around 2010, driven by the convergence of advanced fabrication techniques and a deeper understanding of biomaterial-cell interactions. This era is characterized by the development of composite materials and \"smart\" biomaterials tailored for specific regenerative medicine needs [[23]]. The introduction of three-dimensional (3D) printing revolutionized scaffold fabrication, allowing for unprecedented control over pore architecture, interconnectivity, and overall geometry [[5,17]]. This precision is critical for guiding tissue growth in complex anatomical sites. Concurrently, there was a concerted effort to overcome chitosan's inherent limitations—such as poor mechanical strength and solubility at neutral pH—by creating composites with other polymers (collagen, gelatin, PCL), ceramics (hydroxyapatite), and functional nanoparticles (silver, graphene oxide) [[5,7]]. These composite approaches yielded synergistic materials with vastly improved properties suitable for demanding applications like bone and cartilage regeneration. Today, the field is focused on developing multi-functional materials that not only provide a structural template but also actively participate in the healing process. This includes incorporating bioactive molecules (growth factors, drugs) for controlled release, integrating stimuli-responsive elements for on-demand activation, and designing materials with osteoinductive and immunomodulatory properties [[5,21]]. The historical trajectory shows a clear progression from a simple, naturally-derived polymer to a sophisticated, designer material engineered at the nano- and micro-scale for precise biological control.",

      "content": "The successful translation of chitosan from a bulk polymer to a functional tissue engineering scaffold relies on a sophisticated arsenal of fabrication and modification techniques. These methods allow for the creation of complex, hierarchical structures with tailored architectures, porosity, and surface properties necessary to guide cell behavior and tissue regeneration. The choice of technique is dictated by the desired application, whether it is a porous 3D scaffold for bone ingrowth, an aligned nanofiber mesh for nerve guidance, or an injectable hydrogel for soft tissue repair. Freeze-drying, also known as lyophilization, remains one of the most common methods for producing porous chitosan scaffolds [[5,21]]. This process involves freezing a chitosan solution and then subliming the ice under vacuum, leaving behind a solid foam with a highly interconnected porous network. By varying parameters such as freezing temperature and concentration, scaffold porosity can be tuned to exceed 90%, with pore sizes ranging from 50 to 1000 μm, which is ideal for cell infiltration and nutrient diffusion [[5]]. Scaffolds fabricated via freeze-drying of chitosan-alginate mixtures have shown excellent biocompatibility and support for Vero cell adhesion [[1]].\n\nElectrospinning is another powerful technique used to produce chitosan-based nanofibrous mats that mimic the fibrous nature of the natural ECM [[6,16]]. This method uses an electric field to draw jets of a polymer solution into ultra-fine fibers, which are collected on a grounded collector. To achieve spinnability, chitosan is often blended with other polymers like polyethylene oxide (PEO) or dissolved in strong acids like trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) [[16]]. Electrospun mats can be loaded with various bioactive agents, such as silver nanoparticles for antibacterial properties or simvastatin for odontoblastic differentiation [[7,16]]. More advanced versions of this technique, such as coaxial electrospinning, allow for the creation of core-shell nanofibers, which can protect encapsulated cells or growth factors and provide sequential release profiles [[17,18]]. For applications requiring patient-specific implants or complex geometries, 3D printing, or additive manufacturing, has become indispensable [[4,17]]. This technique builds scaffolds layer-by-layer from a digital model, offering unparalleled precision in controlling pore size, wall thickness, and internal architecture. Studies have successfully 3D printed chitosan composites with collagen and hydroxyapatite, demonstrating uniform porosity and homogeneity suitable for bone and cartilage repair [[5,24]].\n\nWhile fabrication techniques define the physical structure, material modification is what unlocks chitosan's full potential by enhancing its properties and imparting new functionalities. Chemical modification is a powerful strategy to overcome the polymer's inherent limitations, such as poor solubility at neutral pH. Through processes like grafting, sulphonation, or quaternization, the chitosan backbone can be functionalized to create water-soluble derivatives that are effective across a broader pH range [[4,20]]. For example, phosphorylation has been shown to increase transfection efficiency for gene delivery by 100-fold [[20]]. Physical blending is another popular approach, where chitosan is combined with other natural or synthetic polymers to create composites with synergistic properties [[7]]. Common partners include collagen and gelatin for improved cell adhesion, hyaluronic acid for ligament regeneration, silk fibroin for musculofascial repair, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) for enhanced mechanical strength in cartilage applications [[2,4,13]]. The addition of reinforcing agents like hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanoparticles is critical for bone tissue engineering, as it imparts osteoconductivity and improves the compressive strength of the scaffold [[5,17]]. Similarly, incorporating metallic nanoparticles like silver (nAg), copper (nCu), or zinc oxide (nZnO) can impart potent, long-lasting antimicrobial properties to dressings and coatings [[18,25]]. Finally, surface modification techniques, such as plasma treatment or coating with other polymers, can alter surface topography, wettability, and charge to specifically enhance cell attachment and proliferation [[20]]. The combination of advanced fabrication and strategic modification allows for the rational design of next-generation chitosan-based biomaterials tailored for specific clinical needs.\n\n| Technique | Description | Typical Application / Result | Key Enhancements | Citations |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Freeze-Drying** | Freezing a chitosan solution and removing the solvent via sublimation under vacuum. | Creation of highly porous (up to 90+%), interconnected scaffolds with controllable pore sizes (50-1000 µm).

      "content": "The versatility of chitosan-based materials has led to their investigation across a wide spectrum of tissue engineering applications, each requiring a different set of material properties. The ultimate goal in each case is to create a biomimetic environment that supports and directs the complex cascade of events involved in tissue repair and regeneration. The success of these applications hinges on the careful tailoring of chitosan's properties through fabrication and modification to match the specific biological and mechanical demands of the target tissue.\n\nIn **bone tissue engineering**, the primary objective is to create a scaffold that is mechanically robust enough to bear load, osteoconductive to support mineral deposition, and capable of delivering bioactive cues to stimulate bone formation [[3,17]]. Pure chitosan scaffolds often lack sufficient mechanical strength and are not inherently osteoinductive, necessitating the creation of composites [[17]]. A common strategy is to incorporate inorganic phases like hydroxyapatite (HAP), which is the main mineral component of bone [[5,17]]. Nanosized HAP particles can be uniformly dispersed within a chitosan matrix to create hybrid scaffolds that exhibit significantly enhanced tensile strength and promote the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells [[17]]. Composites with collagen or gelatin also improve cell adhesion and proliferation [[17]]. To further enhance bone formation, these scaffolds are often loaded with bioactive molecules. For example, loading with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) promotes the ossification of mesenchymal stem cells [[5]]<URL148>. Other additives include ions from bioactive glasses (doped with Sr²⁺, Mg²⁺, Si⁴⁺) that enhance both angiogenesis and osteogenesis [[5]], and antibiotics like vancomycin delivered via statin-loaded nanofibers to prevent infection in bone defects [[7]]. Clinical trials have evaluated chitosan/tricalcium phosphate composites for mandibular fractures, showing promise as an alternative to autografts [[24]].\n\nFor **cartilage repair**, the challenge lies in creating a hydrophilic, resilient, and lubricious material that can withstand compressive forces while supporting the synthesis of a specialized extracellular matrix rich in type II collagen and proteoglycans [[4,7]]. Chitosan's structural similarity to N-acetylglucosamine units found in GAGs makes it a suitable candidate [[7]]. Chitosan-based hydrogels, often blended with alginate or glycol chitosan, are frequently used as injectable fillers that can be crosslinked in situ to restore damaged articular cartilage [[7]]. Biphasic scaffolds, which feature a dense, hard bottom layer containing HAP for the underlying bone and a softer top layer of chitosan/cellulose for the cartilage, have been developed to regenerate osteochondral defects [[7]]. To drive chondrogenesis, these scaffolds are loaded with growth factors like transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) or kartogenin [[7]]. One ongoing clinical trial is currently assessing the efficacy of JointRep®, a CS-based hydrogel, for knee cartilage repair [[24]]. Despite these advances, improving the long-term mechanical durability of chitosan-based cartilage constructs remains an active area of research.\n\nChitosan-based materials play a pivotal role in **wound healing and skin regeneration** due to their hemostatic, antimicrobial, and pro-regenerative properties [[13,23]]. Commercially available dressings made from chitosan come in various forms, including films, sponges, and hydrogels [[18]]. These dressings absorb wound exudate, maintain a moist wound bed conducive to healing, and prevent infection [[18,23]]. They can be loaded with a variety of therapeutic agents to accelerate healing, such as natural extracts (Aloe vera, Manuka honey), antibiotics (ciprofloxacin), or growth factors [[18]]. Collagen-chitosan scaffolds have been shown to support re-epithelialization and promote fibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis [[6,13]]. Exosome-loaded chitosan dressings have also been used to enhance angiogenesis in diabetic rat models [[25]]. For more severe burns or chronic wounds, 3D-printed chitosan scaffolds seeded with cells offer a more advanced therapeutic option [[24]]. The table below summarizes some representative examples of chitosan-based applications across different tissues.\n\n| Tissue Type | Application Example | Fabrication Method | Bioactive Additives / Features | Targeted Outcomes | Citations |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Bone** | Bone Scaffold | 3D Printing (CS/Coll/nHA) | rhBMP-2, Bioactive Glass (Sr²⁺, Mg²⁺) | Osteogenesis, Angiogenesis, Load-bearing | `[[24]]`, `[[5]]`, `[[17]]` |\n| **Cartilage** | Injectable Hydrogel | Ionic Gelation (Glycol CS/PEG) | TGF-β1, Kartogenin | Chondrogenesis, Matrix Deposition (Type II Collagen) | `[[7]]`, `[[24]]` |\n| **Skin** | Wound Dressing | Film Casting, Sponge Formation | Natural Extracts (Manuka Honey), Exosomes | Hemostasis, Antimicrobial Action, Re-epithelialization | `[[18]]`, `[[25]]`, `[[13]]` |\n| **Nerve** | Conduit / Guide | Electrospinning (CH/SF), 3D Printing | NGF, Esterase-activable Release Systems | Schwann Cell Alignment, Axonal Growth, Functional Recovery | `[[4]]`, `[[13]]`, `[[24]]` |\n| **Cornea** | Corneal Substitute | Freeze-Drying (Collagen/Chitosan) | PEG Stabilization | Cell Adhesion, Transparency, Potential for Vision Restoration | `[[6]]` |\n| **Vascular** | Small-Diameter Graft | Electrospinning (CH/Gel/PCL) | Heparin | Reduced Thrombosis, Endothelial Cell Migration | `[[13]]` |\n\nOther significant applications include **nerve regeneration**, where chitosan conduits or aligned nanofiber mats guide the regrowth of axons across gaps [[13,24]]; **corneal engineering**, where chitosan-collagen hydrogels serve as temporary scaffolds for corneal keratocytes [[13]]; and **vascular tissue engineering**, where heparin-modified chitosan scaffolds reduce thrombosis and promote endothelialization of small-diameter grafts [[13]]. Each of these applications demonstrates how the fundamental properties of chitosan can be strategically manipulated to address the unique challenges of regenerating a specific tissue type.",

      "content": "Despite the significant progress made in the development of chitosan-based bioactive materials, several fundamental challenges and open problems persist, hindering their widespread clinical translation. Addressing these issues will be the focus of future research and is critical for realizing the full therapeutic potential of these materials. Perhaps the most pervasive limitation is the issue of **poor mechanical strength**, particularly in wet environments like the human body [[7,23]]. Pure chitosan scaffolds are often too fragile to serve as load-bearing implants for applications like bone or cartilage. While composite strategies involving polymers like PCL or collagen and ceramics like HAP have shown promise, optimizing the synergy between these components to achieve mechanical properties comparable to native tissue remains a formidable task [[17,22]]. Another closely related challenge is the problem of **burst drug release** from chitosan matrices [[7]]. The porous nature of scaffolds can lead to the rapid, uncontrolled release of encapsulated growth factors or drugs, which is undesirable for achieving sustained, localized therapeutic concentrations. Developing novel encapsulation strategies and responsive release systems is an active area of research.\n\nThe inherent **poor solubility** of chitosan in neutral and alkaline pH is a double-edged sword. While it is responsible for its useful polycationic properties, it also complicates processing and limits its use in injectable systems that need to gel at body temperature and pH [[4,12]]. This has driven the search for water-soluble derivatives, but ensuring that these modifications do not adversely affect biocompatibility or bioactivity is a delicate balance [[4,20]]. Furthermore, the **batch-to-batch variability** in chitosan sourced from natural origins poses a significant regulatory and quality control challenge for commercial production [[12,24]]. Differences in MW, DD, and purity can lead to inconsistent performance, making it difficult to standardize products for clinical use. Long-term in vivo assessment is also a critical open problem, especially for load-bearing applications. While short-term studies may show promising results, the long-term stability, degradation profile, and integration of the implanted material with host tissue require extensive evaluation beyond six months to ensure safety and efficacy [[24]]. Finally, scalability from laboratory-scale production to industrial manufacturing while maintaining consistent quality and performance is a major hurdle that must be overcome for clinical adoption [[24]].\n\nLooking forward, future research directions are aimed at moving beyond passive scaffolds toward **intelligent, multi-functional biomaterials**. One promising avenue is the development of **stimuli-responsive materials**. These systems can change their properties in response to specific triggers within the body, such as changes in pH, temperature, or enzyme levels. For example, photothermal scaffolds incorporating gold nanoparticles can generate localized heat to kill residual cancer cells, as seen in GO/CS/HAP systems [[5]]. Magnetic fields can be used to activate scaffolds containing magnetic nanoparticles, enhancing bone repair pathways [[5]]. Another key direction is the incorporation of **immunomodulatory features**. Instead of just providing a scaffold, future materials will aim to actively modulate the host immune response to promote regeneration and suppress chronic inflammation. Chitosan itself has anti-inflammatory properties, and combining it with immunomodulatory agents like exosomes or incorporating it into composites with materials that polarize macrophages toward a pro-reparative M2 phenotype holds great promise for improving outcomes in regenerative medicine [[21,24]]. The continued integration of nanotechnology, advanced fabrication techniques like 3D printing, and a deeper understanding of cellular and molecular biology will undoubtedly drive the next generation of chitosan-based materials. The ultimate goal is to create \"smart\" implants that can sense their environment, respond appropriately, and actively guide the complex process of tissue regeneration.\n\n---",
