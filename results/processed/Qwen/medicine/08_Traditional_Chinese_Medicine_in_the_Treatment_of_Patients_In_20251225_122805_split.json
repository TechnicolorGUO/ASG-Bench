      "content": "The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting COVID-19 pandemic presented a global health crisis of unprecedented scale, prompting an urgent search for effective therapeutic interventions. In response to this challenge, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with its long history of managing epidemic diseases, was rapidly integrated into clinical practice, particularly within China [[4,7]]. The application of TCM during this period offers a unique opportunity to examine the role of complex, multi-component botanical therapies in the context of a novel viral pathogen. This systematic literature review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the use of TCM for the treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, synthesizing evidence from preclinical research, clinical trials, and official guidelines to evaluate its efficacy, mechanisms of action, and place within an integrated healthcare model. The motivation for this review stems from the need to critically assess the extensive body of work generated during the pandemic, understand the specific contributions of TCM, and identify future research directions that can clarify its potential benefits and limitations.\n\nThis review is structured to systematically dissect the multifaceted application of TCM against SARS-CoV-2. It begins by exploring the historical and theoretical underpinnings that guide its use, followed by an examination of the key concepts, definitions, and classification systems employed in TCM diagnosis and treatment. Subsequently, the report delves into the current state-of-the-art methods used to study TCM, including advanced pharmacological techniques and their findings. The core of the review then presents a detailed analysis of the clinical applications and case studies, focusing on the efficacy of specific herbal formulas and injections as documented in meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials. Following this, the report critically analyzes the field's strengths and weaknesses, identifying significant challenges and open problems related to methodology, standardization, and mechanistic understanding. Finally, based on this comprehensive synthesis, the review concludes with a summary of key findings and outlines future research trajectories necessary to advance the scientific validation and integration of TCM into global health strategies for future pandemics.",

      "content": "The application of Traditional Chinese Medicine to infectious diseases like COVID-19 is deeply rooted in a sophisticated theoretical framework that has evolved over millennia. This system is not merely a collection of remedies but a holistic philosophy centered on the principles of \"holism\" and \"syndrome differentiation and treatment\" (辨证论治, *bian zheng lun zhi*) [[21]]. Holism posits that the human body is an interconnected whole, where the health of one organ system affects all others. Consequently, treatments are designed to restore overall balance rather than simply targeting a localized symptom or pathogen. For respiratory illnesses such as those caused by SARS-CoV-2, this involves recognizing connections between the lungs and other organs, most notably the large intestine, the spleen-stomach-lung axis, and even the heart and liver [[15]]. This perspective allows for a more nuanced approach to disease management, considering systemic impacts beyond the respiratory tract.\n\nThe historical development of TCM's role in epidemics provides the foundation for its modern application. China has a documented history of managing over 300 recorded epidemics since 206 BC, accumulating extensive experience in controlling contagious diseases [[1,7]]. These historical successes are credited with preventing mass mortality events on the scale of the 1918 influenza pandemic [[7]]. The theoretical basis for treating epidemics in TCM categorizes them as 'plagues' (*zhengyi*), caused by a pathogenic factor known as 'grumpiness' (*liqi*), which enters the body through the mouth and nose [[15]]. This pathogen is characterized as 'wet poison' (*shidu*), with dampness being the dominant evil, often mingled with wind, heat, cold, or dryness [[15,22]]. This concept of 'damp-toxicity plagues' (*shireiyi*) serves as a foundational theory for prevention and treatment strategies [[22]].\n\nIn the context of COVID-19, TCM practitioners utilize the 'Wei-Qi-Ying-Xue' (卫气营血) theory to analyze the disease's progression through four distinct stages: Wei (Defensive Qi), Qi (Nutritive Qi), Ying (Nutritive), and Xue (Blood) [[15,17]]. This framework guides treatment according to the stage of illness. Early-stage infection, corresponding to the Wei and Qi levels, is treated by \"dredging the exterior and ventilating lung qi.\" As the disease advances to the Qi and Ying levels, with pathogens blocking the lungs or accumulating in the stomach, the focus shifts to \"clearing dampness and reducing adverse qi.\" In the critical Blood level, characterized by severe organ damage, the goal becomes \"resuscitation and restoring Yang.\" Finally, during the recovery phase, treatment emphasizes \"tonifying qi and yin\" to expel any remaining pathogenic factors and restore healthy qi [[15]].\n\nClinical syndromes are central to TCM diagnosis. Analysis of protocols from China revealed common syndromes associated with COVID-19, including Damp-Heat Accumulation in the Lung (DHL), Damp Abundance due to Spleen Deficiency (DSD), and Epidemic Toxin Invading the Lung (ETL) [[11]]. These syndromes are further defined by key elements such as dampness, heat, toxin, and cold [[11]]. Modern research has sought to bridge traditional syndrome differentiation with objective biomedical markers. For instance, a 2023 study developed a machine learning model using clinical data from over 1,400 pneumonia patients to differentiate TCM 'cold' and 'hot' syndromes, incorporating features like C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil percentage, and age, achieving a high degree of accuracy [[20]]. This integration represents a significant step towards enhancing the objectivity and reproducibility of TCM diagnostics. The combination of these time-honored theories with modern computational tools underscores the dynamic and evolving nature of TCM practice.",

      "content": "The scientific investigation of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) against SARS-CoV-2 has been propelled by the adoption of advanced, technology-driven methodologies. These state-of-the-art approaches aim to move beyond empirical observation and elucidate the complex mechanisms through which multi-component herbal formulations exert their effects. A cornerstone of this effort is network pharmacology, a systems biology method that maps the interactions between herbal compounds, their molecular targets, and biological pathways [[3,9]]. By constructing \"herb-compound-target-pathway\" networks, researchers can predict the multitarget activity of TCM formulas, which is considered a hallmark of their therapeutic potential [[1,9]]. Molecular docking analysis is another critical technique used to computationally simulate how specific bioactive compounds bind to key proteins involved in viral replication or the host immune response, providing insights into direct antiviral or anti-inflammatory actions [[3,12,18]]. These methods have been instrumental in identifying numerous active components and their putative targets, bridging the gap between traditional knowledge and modern molecular biology.\n\nThe proposed mechanisms of action for TCM against SARS-CoV-2 are multifaceted, aligning with the holistic principles of the medicine. They are broadly categorized into three main areas: direct antiviral activity, profound immune regulation, and protection against downstream tissue injury [[3,9]]. Pharmacological studies suggest that certain TCM components can inhibit the virus directly. For example, rheum emodin has been shown to block the binding of the SARS-CoV spike protein to the ACE2 receptor, while glycyrrhizic acid may prevent viral entry via the same pathway [[21]]. Other compounds like baicalin (from *Scutellaria baicalensis*) and hesperetin (from dried tangerine peel) have also been proposed to potentially bind to ACE2 receptors, inhibiting viral entry [[1]]. While promising, this area of research requires more robust validation through clinical trials.\n\nPerhaps the most compelling evidence for TCM's efficacy lies in its ability to modulate the host immune response, particularly by mitigating the \"cytokine storm,\" a severe complication of COVID-19. Formulas like Lianhua Qingwen and Xuebijing have been shown to downregulate key inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 [[21,25]]. Network pharmacology analyses have identified that multiple active compounds—such as formononetin, luteolin, quercetin, baicalein, and emodin—can stably bind to both antiviral targets (like RdRp, PLpro, Nsp14) and crucial anti-inflammatory/immune-regulating targets (like IL-6, TNF, AKT1) [[18]]. This dual-action capability is a powerful feature of TCM. Furthermore, some herbs promote interferon production, which is vital for the innate antiviral defense. For instance, baicalin was found to promote IFN-γ production by CD4+, CD8+ T, and NK cells, activating the JAK/STAT signaling pathway [[21]]. Beyond direct modulation, TCM preparations like Xuebijing Injection have demonstrated inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 itself in laboratory settings [[9]]. Another critical mechanism is the mitigation of lung injury and fibrosis, a major cause of morbidity in post-COVID-19 patients. Patented medicines like Ludangshen oral liquid have been shown to improve cardiopulmonary symptoms in post-COVID patients by modulating the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway [[13]]. The integration of these diverse mechanistic insights—from antiviral inhibition to immune homeostasis and tissue repair—supports the view of TCM as a comprehensive therapeutic strategy.",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The clinical application of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for COVID-19 has been evaluated extensively through numerous clinical trials and meta-analyses, yielding a substantial body of evidence on its efficacy. The consensus from these studies suggests that when used as an adjunct to conventional Western medicine (CWM), TCM significantly improves patient outcomes across several key domains. A comprehensive meta-analysis of 22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that TCM combined with standard care led to a faster time to recovery from fever, cough, and fatigue [[2]]. Critically, this analysis also reported that TCM reduced the risk of ICU admission by 84% and mortality by 56% compared to standard care alone [[2]]. Similarly, a meta-analysis of 25 RCTs concluded that TCM plus routine treatment significantly improved clinical cure rates, chest image improvement, and reduced clinical deterioration, ARDS incidence, mechanical ventilation use, and death [[19]]. The effect sizes were substantial, demonstrating moderate-certainty evidence for many of these outcomes [[19]].\n\nAnother large-scale review encompassing 31 studies (14,579 participants) found that integrated TCM-WM therapy significantly increased the overall clinical efficacy rate and reduced the case fatality rate by 69% compared to WM alone [[25]]. Further analysis confirmed that this integrative approach shortened hospital stays, fever disappearance time, and cough resolution time, while improving CT scan results and promoting faster viral clearance [[24,25]]. However, it is important to note that not all outcomes showed a statistically significant advantage; one meta-analysis found no significant difference in hospitalization duration or discharge rates, and another found no significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test negativity [[2,19]]. This variability highlights the complexity of TCM's effects and the importance of carefully interpreting the totality of evidence.\n\nThe table below summarizes the key findings from several major meta-analyses, illustrating the consistent pattern of positive results for TCM as an adjunctive therapy.\n\n| Outcome Measure | Effect Size & Significance | Supporting Sources |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Reduction in Mortality** | RR = 0.44 (95% CI [0.24; 0.78]); p = 0.0052 (56%) | `[[2]]` |\n| | OR = 0.31 (95% CI = 0.19–0.49); I² = 80% (69%) | `[[25]]` |\n| | RR = 0.28 (95% CI [0.09, 0.84]); P = 0.02 (72%) | `[[19]]` |\n| | RR = 0.55 (95% CI [0.42; 0.71]); p < 0.0001 (45% reduction) | `[[12]]` |\n| **Reduction in ICU Admission** | RR = 0.16 (95% CI [0.04; 0.58]); p = 0.0053 (84% reduction) | `[[2]]` |\n| **Reduction in Severe Conversion** | RR = 0.40 (95% CI: 0.33–0.49) (60% reduction) | `[[24]]` |\n| | RR = 0.55 (95% CI [0.42; 0.71]); p < 0.0001 (45% reduction) | `[[12]]` |\n| **Time to Symptom Resolution** | Reduced fever by -1.1 days (p = 0.0009) | `[[2]]` |\n| | Reduced cough by -2.63 days (p = 0.0272) | `[[2]]` |\n| | Reduced fatigue by -2.28 days (p < 0.0001) | `[[2]]` |\n| **Viral Clearance** | Increased conversion rate (RR = 1.21; p < 0.0001) | `[[2]]` |\n| | Shortened time to conversion by -0.85 days (p = 0.0025) | `[[2]]` |\n| | No significant difference (RR = 1.08; p = 0.29) | `[[19]]` |\n\nSpecific TCM interventions have emerged as prominent candidates for clinical use. Based on extensive evidence, living guidelines from the UK have strongly recommended Lianhua Qingwen granules/capsules and Qingfei Paidu decoction for mild-to-moderate cases [[6]]. Other formulas like Jinhua Qinggan, Shufeng Jiedu, Huashi Baidu, and Xuanfei Baidu have also received strong or weak recommendations [[5,6]]. Among these, Lianhua Qingwen (LHQW) holds a special place, having been the first drug approved in China for the treatment of COVID-19 due to its proven clinical efficacy [[21]]. LHQW is derived from classic formulas for wind-heat and toxic-heat conditions and is included in China's national protocols from the 7th edition onwards [[10]]. Similarly, Qingfei Paidu decoction, innovated during the pandemic, is highly recommended and has been shown in retrospective studies to be associated with favorable outcomes when used early [[9,18]]. Herbal injections like Xuebijing, the only one approved for sepsis, have also demonstrated benefits, particularly in reducing ICU stay and ventilator use in severe pneumonia patients [[1,9]]. These findings collectively demonstrate that TCM, especially when integrated with conventional care, is a potent therapeutic tool in the fight against COVID-19.",

      "content": "Despite the compelling evidence supporting the clinical efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in treating SARS-CoV-2, the field is fraught with significant challenges, limitations, and unresolved questions that temper enthusiasm and necessitate a cautious, critical evaluation. One of the most fundamental challenges is the inherent complexity of TCM preparations themselves. Unlike single-compound pharmaceuticals, TCM formulas are multi-component mixtures whose precise composition can vary based on herb quality, sourcing, processing, and preparation methods [[1,18]]. This lack of standardization makes it exceedingly difficult to replicate studies and compare results across different trials. While efforts are being made to standardize patent medicines, the variability in herbal decoctions remains a major hurdle for rigorous scientific assessment.\n\nMethodological rigor in the existing body of research is a persistent concern. Many of the early clinical trials conducted during the height of the pandemic suffered from design flaws, including small sample sizes, lack of blinding, and high risk of bias, which limits the confidence in their conclusions [[2,18]]. Although a growing number of high-quality RCTs have been published, a significant portion of the literature still relies on observational studies and case series, which are more susceptible to confounding factors [[12]]. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, for instance, rated half of the studies in one major meta-analysis as having a high risk of bias [[2]]. This methodological weakness means that some of the observed benefits could be attributable to placebo effects, publication bias, or other uncontrolled variables rather than the specific pharmacological properties of the TCM intervention.\n\nFurthermore, there is a notable gap in the research focused on the post-acute phase of COVID-19, often referred to as \"long COVID.\" While initial treatment has been well-documented, the management of persistent symptoms like fatigue, breathlessness, and cognitive dysfunction remains less explored in the provided sources [[13,18]]. Most of the available evidence pertains to the acute infection phase, leaving a critical need for dedicated studies on TCM's role in recovery and rehabilitation. Additionally, the vast majority of the research, including the largest meta-analyses, has been conducted in China, raising questions about the generalizability of the findings to other populations with different genetic backgrounds, dietary habits, and co-existing health conditions [[2,25]]. There is a clear call for more international, multicenter trials to validate TCM's efficacy globally [[2]].\n\nFinally, a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms is required. While network pharmacology and molecular docking have generated valuable hypotheses, much of this work remains at a predictive stage [[3]]. There is a pressing need for more in-depth pharmacological studies on natural herbs to validate their effects *in vitro* and *in vivo*, moving beyond computational models to confirm their activity in relevant biological systems [[3,18]]. The interaction between different components within a formula, known as synergism or antagonism, is poorly understood. Unraveling these complex interactions is essential to optimize formulations and develop new, evidence-based TCM drugs. Overcoming these challenges will require a concerted effort involving improved trial design, greater international collaboration, and a deeper commitment to basic science research.",

      "content": "In conclusion, the systematic review of the literature reveals that Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) played a significant and widely applied role in the management of COVID-19, particularly within China. The collective evidence from numerous meta-analyses indicates that integrating TCM with conventional Western medicine leads to improved clinical outcomes, including a substantially lower risk of mortality and severe disease progression, faster symptom relief, and shorter hospital stays. The theoretical frameworks of TCM, such as syndrome differentiation and the 'Wei-Qi-Ying-Xue' theory, provide a structured approach to treatment that has guided the selection of specific herbal formulas and patent medicines with demonstrable clinical utility. Advanced research methods like network pharmacology have begun to shed light on the multitarget mechanisms of TCM, suggesting its primary strength lies in its ability to regulate the complex interplay between viral infection and the host immune response.\n\nHowever, the path forward requires navigating significant challenges. The inherent complexity and lack of standardization of TCM preparations remain major obstacles to rigorous scientific validation. Methodological weaknesses in existing studies necessitate a push towards higher-quality, multicenter, double-blinded RCTs conducted outside of China to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the findings. Future research must also address the critical gap in understanding TCM's role in managing post-COVID-19 conditions. The WHO Expert Meeting on TCM and COVID-19 has already recommended further high-quality global trials, underscoring the international community's interest in validating these interventions [[2]].\n\nTo conclude, the future of TCM in the context of emerging infectious diseases should be shaped by a dual-pronged strategy. First, it must embrace a more rigorous scientific paradigm, leveraging modern pharmacology, genomics, and artificial intelligence to deconstruct its complex formulas, validate their mechanisms of action, and establish standardized, reproducible products. Second, it must continue to refine its clinical application through large-scale comparative effectiveness trials that place TCM within an integrated care model. By combining the wisdom of centuries of clinical observation with the precision of modern science, the full therapeutic potential of TCM can be unlocked, offering a valuable contribution to global health preparedness for future pandemics.\n\n---",
