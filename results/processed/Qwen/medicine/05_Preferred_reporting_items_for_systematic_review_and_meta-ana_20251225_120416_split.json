      "content": "The accurate diagnosis of disease is a cornerstone of modern medicine, influencing treatment decisions, patient outcomes, and healthcare resource allocation. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) studies are considered the highest level of evidence for evaluating the performance of a diagnostic test. However, the validity and utility of these syntheses are fundamentally dependent on the transparency and completeness of the reporting of the primary DTA studies they include. For decades, the field has grappled with significant challenges related to poor and inconsistent reporting in DTA research, which creates substantial barriers to reliable evidence synthesis and can lead to biased conclusions, ultimately contributing to \"research waste\" [[1]]. This problem has been well-documented, with numerous studies highlighting critical information gaps in published reports of DTA studies, such as unclear patient selection criteria, lack of description of the reference standard, and failure to report thresholds for positivity [[13]].\n\nIn response to this challenge, a suite of reporting guidelines was developed. The Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) statement, first published in 2003 and updated in 2015, established a 30-item checklist designed to improve the completeness of reporting for individual DTA studies [[1,4,7]]. While STARD provided a much-needed foundation, it addressed only one part of the evidence ecosystem. There remained a critical need for a corresponding guideline tailored specifically to the unique methodological complexities of systematic reviews that aggregate DTA evidence. This led to the development of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA). Published in 2018, PRISMA-DTA was conceived as an extension of the broader PRISMA statement, providing a targeted framework to ensure that reviews of DTA evidence are reported transparently and comprehensively [[4]]. Its development was built upon the foundations laid by previous initiatives like STARD and the QUality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2), aiming to fill a crucial gap in the hierarchy of reporting standards [[2,5]].\n\nThe motivation for developing and rigorously evaluating PRISMA-DTA is rooted in the profound impact of reporting quality on clinical practice and health policy. Incomplete reporting from primary studies makes it difficult for reviewers to assess risk of bias and applicability, leading to potential misinterpretation of results. When reviews themselves are poorly reported, their findings are less trustworthy and harder to replicate or update. The goal of PRISMA-DTA is therefore twofold: to enhance the quality of individual DTA reviews and, by extension, to improve the overall integrity of the evidence base used to guide medical decision-making. The successful implementation of such guidelines requires not only robust methodology but also widespread adoption and enforcement by researchers, peer reviewers, and journal editors. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the PRISMA-DTA guideline, examining its historical development, current application, and the persistent challenges and future directions that will shape its role in advancing the field of diagnostic test evaluation.",

      "content": "The PRISMA-DTA statement is a structured guideline designed to improve the transparency and completeness of reports of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy studies. It operates within the framework of the EQUATOR (Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research) Network, a global initiative dedicated to improving the reliability and value of medical research literature [[4,12]]. The guideline consists of several core components, including a 27-item checklist for the main body of a review and a separate 12-item checklist for the abstract. These checklists provide specific items that authors should report to ensure their work is clear, complete, and useful to readers. The development process involved synthesizing relevant items from existing guidelines, including the original PRISMA 2009 statement, STARD 2015, and QUADAS-2, ensuring that the final product was both comprehensive and contextually appropriate for DTA reviews [[2]].\n\nThe **PRISMA-DTA Checklist for the Main Text** is the central component of the guideline. It covers the essential sections of a systematic review, guiding authors through a logical reporting structure. Key items address the study's title and abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, and funding. For instance, in the methods section, reviewers are prompted to state whether their review is comparative or non-comparative (Item 3), provide detailed descriptions of the index test, reference standard, and target condition (Item 23), and specify the statistical models used for data synthesis, such as bivariate random-effects models that appropriately account for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity [[2]]. In the results section, authors are expected to report the number and characteristics of included studies, present summary estimates of diagnostic accuracy with confidence intervals, and detail the results of any subgroup analyses or meta-regression [[11]]. The inclusion of these specific items ensures that all critical aspects of a DTA review are systematically addressed.\n\nRecognizing that many users of scientific literature, particularly busy clinicians and researchers, primarily rely on abstracts, the PRISMA-DTA group also developed the **PRISMA-DTA for Abstracts** guideline. This 12-item checklist adapts the principles of the full PRISMA-DTA statement for the limited space of an abstract [[4,11]]. The development process involved deleting one item from the original PRISMA for Abstracts checklist, adding a new item focused on the statistical methods used for data synthesis (A1), and rephrasing six others to better suit the DTA context [[4,11]]. Key items include identifying the report as a systematic review of DTA, stating the objectives with details on participants, index test, and target condition, describing the eligibility criteria, and reporting the number of included studies along with their key characteristics [[11]]. Evaluations have shown that adherence to this guideline is suboptimal, with baseline assessments indicating that only half of the 12 items were consistently reported in abstracts of DTA reviews [[6,11]]. This highlights a significant opportunity for improvement, with recommendations including that journals increase abstract word limits to allow for more complete reporting, potentially up to 300 words [[11]].\n\nA critical aspect of the PRISMA-DTA framework is its integration with other tools in the evidence synthesis toolkit. Specifically, it is designed to be used in conjunction with the QUADAS-2 tool for assessing the risk of bias and applicability of included studies [[4,10]]. While PRISMA-DTA focuses on *reporting* the review itself, QUADAS-2 provides a standardized instrument for *assessing* the quality of the primary studies. This synergy is vital, as a transparently reported review allows for a more accurate and reliable assessment of bias using QUADAS-2. For example, if a review fails to report how it handled indeterminate test results—a key STARD item—this omission must be noted during the QUADAS-2 assessment. The close relationship between these two tools underscores the importance of a holistic approach to DTA evidence synthesis, where high-quality reporting and rigorous quality assessment are mutually reinforcing.\n\n| Component | Purpose | Key Features |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **PRISMA-DTA 27-Item Checklist** | To guide authors in reporting the full text of a systematic review of DTA studies. | Covers all sections from title to disclosure; includes specific items on statistical models, bias assessment (e.g., using QUADAS-2), and synthesis methods [[2,11]]. |\n| **PRISMA-DTA for Abstracts 12-Item Checklist** | To guide authors in reporting the abstract of a systematic review of DTA studies. | Adapted from the full checklist; adds an item on statistical synthesis methods (A1); items focus on objectives, eligibility criteria, number of studies, and key results [[4,11]]. |\n| **Integration with QUADAS-2** | To facilitate the assessment of risk of bias and applicability of included studies. | PRISMA-DTA guides the reporting of methods for bias assessment, which are then applied using the QUADAS-2 tool [[4,10]]. |\n| **Integration with STARD** | To ensure the primary studies being reviewed meet high reporting standards. | Poor reporting in primary studies (per STARD) hinders the ability of a reviewer to conduct a valid DTA meta-analysis [[13]]. |",

      "content": "The creation of the PRISMA-DTA guideline did not occur in a vacuum; it was the culmination of years of effort to improve the quality of reporting in medical research, building upon a series of foundational milestones. The story begins with the establishment of the EQUATOR Network in the mid-2000s. Recognizing the fragmented nature of guideline development and the need for a centralized hub for disseminating and promoting reporting standards, the network was formed to harmonize efforts and support the implementation of guidelines like STARD and PRISMA [[4,12]]. This organizational infrastructure proved critical for coordinating large-scale, international consensus processes.\n\nThe most direct precursor to PRISMA-DTA was the evolution of the STARD statement itself. First published in 2003, the original STARD 2003 statement introduced a 22-item checklist aimed at improving the reporting of individual diagnostic accuracy studies [[1,7]]. This initial version was informed by extensive methodological research and stakeholder consultation. The success of STARD 2003 paved the way for a major update, resulting in STARD 2015. This iteration expanded the checklist to 30 essential items and incorporated new insights into sources of bias, such as those related to patient selection and interpretation variability [[1,4,7]]. The STARD 2015 explanation and elaboration document, published in BMJ, provided detailed guidance on each checklist item, further cementing its utility for authors and reviewers [[7]]. Concurrently, the QUADAS tool emerged to address the need for a standardized method to assess the quality of DTA studies. This evolved into QUADAS-2, which became the gold standard for assessing risk of bias across four key domains: patient selection, the index test, the reference standard, and the flow and timing of patients through the study [[4,13]].\n\nThe conceptual groundwork for a reporting guideline specifically for DTA reviews was laid out in a pivotal systematic review conducted by McInnes et al. This review, which identified 64 potential checklist items from 19 different sources, including PRISMA, STARD 2015, and AMSTAR, served as the formal starting point for the PRISMA-DTA initiative [[2]]. The project was supported by significant funding from organizations such as the Canadian Institute for Health Research and the University of Ottawa Department of Radiology Research Stipend Program, underscoring its importance to the research community [[4]]. The development process was rigorous and followed best practices for guideline creation. It began with a Delphi survey involving international experts to reach consensus on key principles and priorities. This was followed by a face-to-face consensus meeting where the final set of items was agreed upon by the PRISMA-DTA Group [[4,12]].\n\nThe culmination of this multi-year effort was the publication of the PRISMA-DTA statement in JAMA in 2018 [[4]]. This marked the official launch of the guideline. However, the work did not stop there. To ensure clarity and aid adoption, the PRISMA-DTA Explanation and Elaboration paper was published in the BMJ in 2020 [[4,5]]. This companion document provides detailed rationales and examples for each of the 27 checklist items, transforming the guideline from a simple list of requirements into a practical educational resource. The entire pre-publication history, including reviewer comments and author responses, was made openly available on the BMJ website, reflecting a commitment to transparency in scholarly communication [[5]]. Further expanding the scope, the PRISMA-DTA for Abstracts guideline was developed and published in March 2021, providing a parallel framework for abstract-level reporting [[11]]. This entire timeline of development—from the establishment of the EQUATOR Network to the publication of the full guideline and its extensions—demonstrates a sustained, collaborative, and evidence-based effort to elevate the quality of evidence synthesis in the field of diagnostics.",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The current state of the art in applying PRISMA-DTA involves a growing awareness of its importance alongside persistent and significant challenges in achieving high levels of adherence. Methodologically, the guideline provides a sophisticated framework for reporting complex statistical analyses. A key innovation is the emphasis on using appropriate statistical models for meta-analysis, such as bivariate or hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) models, which correctly account for the inherent statistical correlation between a test's sensitivity and specificity [[2]]. This represents a major advance over simpler approaches that treat sensitivity and specificity as independent measures. The guideline also pushes for greater transparency in reporting the assessment of heterogeneity, the use of subgroup analyses and meta-regression to explore it, and the handling of issues like small-study effects and publication bias. These advanced methods are crucial for producing robust and reliable summaries of diagnostic test performance.\n\nDespite the availability of these powerful methods and the clear guidance provided by the PRISMA-DTA checklist, the real-world application reveals a troubling gap between ideal and practice. Multiple studies have evaluated adherence and consistently found significant deficiencies. A comprehensive analysis of 173 systematic reviews of DTA studies published in 2020–2021 revealed that while PRISMA-DTA was better suited for identifying reporting inadequacies than its predecessors, overall compliance remained low [[3]]. The median overall reporting score was 72.0% according to PRISMA-DTA, substantially lower than the 88.9% score under PRISMA-2009 [[3]]. Another study focusing on 100 DTA reviews published in 2023-2024 found an average full-text reporting completeness of 78%, a slight improvement from a baseline of 71% in 2019, but still far from perfect [[9]]. These findings suggest that simply having a guideline does not guarantee its use or implementation.\n\nThe challenges to adherence are multifaceted. One of the most frequently cited reasons is a lack of awareness among authors and peer reviewers about the existence and importance of the guideline [[13]]. Even when authors are aware of PRISMA-DTA, they may lack access to the detailed Explanation and Elaboration document, which is essential for understanding the rationale behind the items. Another major barrier is insufficient enforcement by journal editors and peer reviewers. Without explicit requirement and rigorous checking, authors have little incentive to invest the time and effort needed to comply fully with a 27-item checklist. Interestingly, a study by Pagkalidou et al. found that higher journal impact factors and the use of supplemental materials were associated with better reporting, suggesting that journals with higher standards may exert more pressure on authors [[9]]. Furthermore, the sheer complexity of DTA reviews, which involve navigating multiple biases and intricate statistical models, can be daunting for researchers who are not methodological experts. This highlights a critical need for better education and training in systematic review methodology.\n\nThe table below summarizes the findings from recent evaluations of adherence to PRISMA-DTA, illustrating the scale of the challenge.\n\n| Study / Evaluation | Number of Reviews | Time Period | Overall Findings | Key Infrequent Items Reported (<33%) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **McInnes et al. (2023)** [[3]] | 173 reviews | 2020–2021 | Median overall reporting score was 72.0% (PRISMA-DTA) vs. 88.9% (PRISMA-2009). Only 24.9% of reviews used PRISMA-DTA. | Title, abstract, eligibility criteria, search, definitions for data extraction, diagnostic accuracy measures, synthesis of results, results of individual studies. |\n| **Salameh et al. (2025)** [[9]] | 100 reviews | Sep 2023–Mar 2024 | Full-text reporting improved slightly to 78%. No significant change in abstract reporting (52%). Higher IF journals showed better reporting. | Eligibility criteria for setting (19%), definitions for data extraction (30%), synthesis of results (≤24%), characteristics of included studies (e.g., clinical setting 28%). |\n| **Pagkalidou et al. (2023)** [[6]] | 72 abstracts | 2010–2020 | Mean reporting scores were 6.2/12 in general journals vs. 5.3/12 in specialized journals. Adherence was higher in journals that adopted PRISMA-DTA. | Number of participants analyzed, funding, registration. |\n| **Baseline Analysis (2019)** [[9]] | Not specified | 2019 | Average full-text reporting completeness was 71%. | Same as Salameh et al. |\n\nThis data collectively paints a picture of a guideline that is recognized as superior in principle but remains critically underutilized in practice. The path forward requires a concerted effort to move beyond simply publishing the guideline and toward active dissemination, education, and enforcement. Strategies such as mandating its use by journals, integrating it into grant proposal templates, and providing accessible training modules could help bridge the gap between the state-of-the-art methods offered by PRISMA-DTA and their actual implementation in the scientific literature.",

      "content": "The application of PRISMA-DTA and its related guidelines can be understood through a combination of case studies demonstrating their use and a comparative analysis against other prominent reporting standards like the original PRISMA and STARD statements. While the provided sources do not contain detailed case studies of individual DTA reviews conducted entirely in accordance with the PRISMA-DTA checklist, they do offer valuable insights into its practical application within larger projects and highlight its distinct role in the evidence synthesis ecosystem.\n\nOne illustrative example is a meta-analysis evaluating androgen measurements for diagnosing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [[10]]. Although the protocol for this review was registered and its findings contributed to international guidelines, the sources emphasize its use of the **QUADAS-2** tool for assessing the risk of bias and applicability of the included studies [[10]]. This serves as an excellent case study of the synergistic workflow that is central to high-quality DTA review. The PCOS review demonstrates how a transparent assessment of study quality, facilitated by QUADAS-2, is a prerequisite for drawing valid conclusions. It also showcases the use of STATA 18 for the meta-analysis, a common software choice for implementing the sophisticated statistical models recommended by PRISMA-DTA [[10]]. This example illustrates that even without explicit mention of PRISMA-DTA in the abstract, a review can embody its principles by using appropriate tools for quality assessment and analysis. The ultimate outcome—the formulation of evidence-based clinical recommendations—demonstrates the tangible benefit of adhering to a rigorous methodology, even if the reporting itself is assessed as suboptimal [[10]].\n\nAnother example comes from the field of cardiovascular diseases, where a study evaluated adherence to PRISMA-DTA for Abstracts in 72 systematic reviews published between 2010 and 2020 [[6]]. The study found that reporting was suboptimal across the board, with mean scores of 6.2 out of 12 in general medical journals and 5.3 in specialized journals. This case study highlights the pervasive nature of the problem and points to a specific area for intervention: specialized journals often lag behind general ones in adopting reporting standards. It also provides concrete examples of what poor reporting looks like in practice, with infrequently reported items including the number of participants analyzed, funding sources, and registration numbers [[6]]. These findings serve as a practical roadmap for journal editors and authors seeking to improve their reporting.\n\nWhen comparing PRISMA-DTA with other guidelines, its distinct purpose becomes clear. The following table outlines the key differences:\n\n| Guideline | Primary Focus | Target Document | Key Distinction |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **PRISMA-DTA** | Improving the reporting of a **systematic review** of DTA studies. | The full-text article of the systematic review. | Provides a detailed checklist for the synthesis process, including how to report bias assessment (using QUADAS-2), statistical methods, and presentation of results. |\n| **PRISMA** | General guidance for reporting of **systematic reviews and meta-analyses** (not specific to DTA). | The full-text article of a systematic review. | Lacks the specific, granular detail required for DTA reviews, such as how to report on the index test, reference standard, and statistical models like bivariate analysis [[3]]. |\n| **STARD** | Improving the reporting of a **single diagnostic accuracy study**. | The primary research article reporting the DTA study. | Addresses questions of participant selection, test execution, and blinding at the study level, whereas PRISMA-DTA addresses these issues at the *synthesis* level. |\n| **QUADAS-2** | Assessing the **risk of bias and applicability** of **individual DTA studies**. | A tool for quality assessment, not a reporting guideline. | Used *in conjunction* with PRISMA-DTA to evaluate the quality of the evidence being synthesized. |\n\nThis comparison clarifies the complementary roles of these instruments. An optimal evidence synthesis would involve: (1) primary studies adhering to STARD, (2) a review author using QUADAS-2 to assess the quality of those studies, and (3) the review itself being reported transparently according to PRISMA-DTA. The finding that PRISMA-DTA identified significantly more reporting inadequacies than PRISMA-2009 and -2020 in critical review sections underscores its superiority for this specific task [[3]]. It is not a replacement for STARD or QUADAS-2, but rather a necessary addition to the toolkit for anyone conducting, reviewing, or reading a systematic review of diagnostic tests. The development of specialized guidelines like STARD-AI for AI-centered DTA studies further emphasizes this trend towards granularity, building upon the STARD 2015 foundation in a similar way that PRISMA-DTA builds upon the PRISMA and STARD frameworks [[8]].",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The PRISMA-DTA guideline represents a significant advancement in the pursuit of transparent and reliable evidence synthesis in diagnostic medicine. Its primary strength lies in its specificity and comprehensiveness, addressing the unique and complex methodological challenges inherent in DTA reviews. By providing a detailed 27-item checklist, it forces authors to consider and report on critical aspects that are often overlooked, such as the justification for statistical models, the handling of heterogeneity, and the precise definition of the index test, reference standard, and target population [[2]]. This granularity is a direct response to the limitations of the general PRISMA statement, making it a more powerful tool for ensuring that DTA reviews are methodologically sound and clinically interpretable. Its integration with the EQUATOR Network and the simultaneous development of the Explanation and Elaboration paper further enhance its credibility and usability, providing not just a checklist but a rich educational resource [[5,12]]. The fact that it explicitly recommends the use of sophisticated statistical models like bivariate random-effects analysis is a crucial strength, as it encourages the use of methods that properly account for the statistical dependencies in diagnostic data [[2]].\n\nHowever, despite these strengths, the implementation of PRISMA-DTA is fraught with open problems and weaknesses that undermine its potential impact. The most significant weakness is the profound gap between the guideline's existence and its routine application. As documented in multiple evaluations, adherence to PRISMA-DTA remains alarmingly low [[3,9]]. This is not merely a matter of oversight; it reflects systemic failures in the scholarly communication process. The primary problem appears to be a lack of enforcement by journal editors and peer reviewers [[13]]. Without a mandate from the publication venue, authors have little incentive to invest the considerable time required to navigate the 27-item checklist and produce a compliant manuscript. This suggests that the effectiveness of PRISMA-DTA is highly conditional on the policies of the journals that publish DTA reviews.\n\nFurthermore, the guideline's complexity, while methodologically sound, presents a significant barrier to entry for researchers who are not methodological experts. The very features that make it strong—such as the requirement to justify the choice of a HSROC model over a simpler alternative—can be intimidating and difficult to implement without specialized knowledge. This creates a disparity in reporting quality between reviews authored by statisticians versus those authored by clinicians or epidemiologists. The guideline does not, on its own, provide the training needed to understand and apply its more advanced statistical recommendations. This points to a critical open problem: the need for a parallel investment in education and training resources to complement the guideline itself. Simply distributing the checklist is insufficient; researchers need accessible tutorials, workshops, and perhaps even integrated software tools that can guide them through the reporting process.\n\nFinally, the underutilization of PRISMA-DTA by the academic community poses another significant challenge. The finding that only 24.9% of 173 recent DTA reviews used the guideline, and that endorsement by specialized journals was minimal, indicates a deep-seated cultural inertia [[3]]. Authors may default to the more familiar general PRISMA guideline, and the absence of a clear, visible signal from the community discourages uptake. This raises the question of whether the guideline's name and visibility are sufficient to distinguish it from the broader PRISMA family. Addressing these interconnected problems—lack of enforcement, user complexity, and low adoption—will require a multi-pronged strategy involving journal publishers, funding agencies, and professional societies working in concert to champion and integrate PRISMA-DTA into the fabric of medical research.",

      "content": "To conclude, the journey of the PRISMA-DTA guideline from a specialized concept to a formally endorsed reporting standard has been marked by significant progress, yet it faces a critical juncture. The guideline possesses undeniable strengths as a methodologically rigorous and comprehensive tool designed to enhance the transparency of systematic reviews of diagnostic tests. Its detailed checklist and close integration with the EQUATOR Network platform have laid a solid foundation for improving the quality of evidence synthesis. However, its full potential remains unrealized due to formidable challenges in adoption and implementation. The evidence clearly shows that PRISMA-DTA is currently underutilized, with adherence remaining suboptimal and journal endorsement rare [[3,9]]. The path forward requires a strategic shift from passive distribution to active implementation, demanding coordinated action from all stakeholders in the research ecosystem.\n\nFuture research and development should focus on addressing the identified open problems. A primary direction is to investigate and implement effective strategies to promote adherence. This includes moving beyond passive dissemination to active enforcement. Future studies should evaluate the impact of journal editorial policies, such as mandating PRISMA-DTA compliance and training editors and peer reviewers on how to use the checklist effectively. Granting bodies could also play a pivotal role by requiring applicants to submit a PRISMA-DTA-compliant protocol or manuscript as part of the grant application or reporting process. Research is needed to identify the most effective channels for communicating the importance of the guideline to different audiences, including authors, reviewers, and editors.\n\nA second critical future direction is to address the knowledge and skill gaps that prevent widespread use. This involves investing in educational initiatives, such as developing online courses, webinars, and practical guides that explain the rationale behind the more complex checklist items, particularly those related to statistical modeling. Integrating PRISMA-DTA principles into postgraduate curricula for clinical epidemiology and biostatistics is essential for cultivating a new generation of researchers who view transparent reporting as a core competency. Furthermore, the development of user-friendly software tools that can assist authors in navigating the checklist and generating PRISMA-DTA-compliant tables and figures would lower the barrier to entry and make the process more efficient.\n\nFinally, the field must continue to evolve alongside emerging technologies and methodologies. The development of specialized guidelines like STARD-AI for artificial intelligence in diagnostics signals a trend towards even greater granularity in reporting standards [[8]]. Future iterations of PRISMA-DTA may need to adapt to incorporate novel statistical techniques or address the specific challenges posed by network meta-analyses of DTA data. The ongoing collaboration between the PRISMA-DTA Group and the broader EQUATOR Network will be crucial for ensuring the guideline remains relevant and responsive to the needs of the research community. In summary, while the PRISMA-DTA guideline has successfully defined the state-of-the-art for reporting DTA reviews, its ultimate success will depend on a collective and sustained effort to translate this excellence in methodology into a standard of practice across the scientific literature.\n\n---",
