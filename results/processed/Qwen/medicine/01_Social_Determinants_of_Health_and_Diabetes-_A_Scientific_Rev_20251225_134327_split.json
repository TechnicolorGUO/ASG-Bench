      "content": "Diabetes mellitus represents one of the most significant global public health challenges of the 21st century, imposing a staggering burden on individuals, healthcare systems, and economies worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies it as a primary non-communicable disease, with its prevalence projected to increase from 463 million adults in 2019 to 700 million by 2045 [[10]]. This epidemic is not uniform; its impact is profoundly shaped by a complex web of factors that extend far beyond individual biology and behavior. These are the social determinants of health (SDoH), defined by the WHO as the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, which are themselves shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels [[1,14]]. For diabetes specifically, these determinants are now understood to be powerful drivers of both incidence and outcomes, often outweighing genetic predisposition and direct access to medical care in their influence [[1]].\n\nThe motivation for this review stems from the urgent need to understand the multifaceted relationship between SDoH and diabetes. While clinical management remains crucial, it is insufficient to address a disease so deeply embedded in societal structures. The persistence of profound health disparities among different populations—defined as differences closely linked with social, economic, or environmental disadvantage—is a clear indicator that a more systemic approach is necessary [[3]]. African Americans are 73% more likely to have diabetes than their White counterparts, and over twice as likely to die from it; Hispanics also exhibit higher prevalence rates [[14]]. Similarly, individuals with lower socioeconomic status (SES), characterized by low income and education, face a significantly elevated risk of developing diabetes and experiencing worse complications [[3,14]]. Understanding why these disparities exist is not merely an academic exercise; it is a prerequisite for developing effective, equitable, and sustainable strategies to mitigate the diabetes epidemic.\n\nThis review aims to provide a comprehensive scientific analysis of the SDoH related to diabetes. Its objectives are threefold: first, to define and map the key concepts and frameworks used to study these determinants; second, to synthesize the current body of evidence linking specific SDoH domains to diabetes risk, self-management, and clinical outcomes; and third, to critically evaluate the state-of-the-art methods for measuring and intervening upon these factors. By examining the historical context, analyzing case studies, and identifying the field's most pressing challenges and future directions, this report seeks to serve as a foundational resource for clinicians, researchers, policymakers, and public health professionals working to create a world where everyone has the opportunity to live a healthy life, free from the burdens of preventable diseases like diabetes. The ultimate goal is to move beyond describing disparities and toward actionable insights that can dismantle the structural barriers preventing optimal health for all individuals affected by diabetes.",

      "content": "The discourse on social determinants of health is built upon a foundation of evolving definitions and conceptual models designed to capture the complexity of how social conditions shape biological outcomes. At its core, the concept of SDoH posits that health is produced through a dynamic interplay between an individual's environment and their biology. The WHO framework is foundational, defining SDoH as the \"conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, and people’s access to money, power and resources,\" which together create \"the inequities in health\" [[1]]. This definition emphasizes that health inequity is not random but is systematically distributed based on social position. More recent work refines this by distinguishing between the immediate living conditions and the underlying political, economic, and cultural drivers that produce them, such as governance, trade agreements, and discriminatory social norms [[6,24]].\n\nBuilding on this broad foundation, various organizations have developed more granular frameworks tailored to specific public health goals. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Healthy People initiative organizes SDoH into five domains: Economic Stability, Education Access and Quality, Healthcare Access and Quality, Neighborhood and Built Environment, and Social and Community Context [[4,9]]. Similarly, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has identified five principal SDoH categories relevant to diabetes: Socioeconomic Status, Neighborhood and Physical Environment, Food Environment, Healthcare Access, and Social Context [[2,14]]. These frameworks operationalize the broader concept, allowing researchers and clinicians to systematically assess and intervene upon specific aspects of a patient's life. For instance, under the ADA's framework, socioeconomic status would encompass income and education, while the neighborhood and physical environment would include housing quality and safety [[14]]. The County Health Rankings Model and the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) model offer alternative structures, each with unique variables that reflect different theoretical priorities [[12,18]].\n\nA critical evolution in this field is the growing recognition of upstream root causes, particularly structural racism. Racism is increasingly understood not just as individual prejudice but as a system that assigns value based on skin color, creating and perpetuating inequities across all other SDoH domains [[14]]. This perspective reframes racial disparities in diabetes not as a biological anomaly but as a predictable outcome of a systemically unjust society. Studies show that structural racism, manifesting through policies like redlining, disenfranchisement, and unequal resource allocation, directly contributes to worse diabetes outcomes [[13]]. In response, there is a strong call within the scientific community to integrate these root causes into mainstream SDoH frameworks, shifting the focus from downstream interventions to multisector initiatives aimed at policy and structural change [[6]]. This requires moving beyond simply acknowledging race as a variable to actively analyzing how governance, public policy, and cultural values create and maintain health disparities [[13]].\n\nThis leads to another key concept: commercial determinants of health (CDoH). CDoH are defined as the actions and omissions by commercial actors that affect health, including the production, pricing, and marketing of products like ultra-processed foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, tobacco, and alcohol [[24]]. These industries wield immense power, shaping consumer behavior and influencing government policy through lobbying and advertising. Their practices contribute directly to the obesity pandemic and type 2 diabetes, creating a powerful counter-narrative to public health efforts promoting healthy diets and lifestyles [[24]]. Acknowledging CDoH expands the scope of inquiry beyond traditional social and political forces to include the economic incentives driving corporate behavior. This perspective highlights the need for regulatory interventions, such as taxes on sugary drinks, bans on misleading food advertising, and reformulation mandates, to counteract the negative health impacts of commercial interests [[24]]. Together, the frameworks of SDoH, structural racism, and CDoH provide a comprehensive lens for understanding the deep-seated origins of diabetes disparities and point toward the need for multi-pronged, cross-sector solutions.",

      "content": "The formal recognition of social determinants of health as a central pillar of public health has a relatively recent history, yet its roots are ancient. The contemporary movement gained significant momentum with the 2008 landmark report from the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) [[5]]. This report was a watershed moment, providing a robust scientific and ethical rationale for addressing the unfair and avoidable inequalities in health. It identified three key messages: that inequalities in SDoH cause inequalities in health; that these inequalities are socially produced; and that they are unnecessary and unjust [[1,5]]. The CSDH outlined a program of action focused on improving daily living conditions, tackling the inequitable distribution of power and resources, and measuring the problem to understand its impact [[1]]. This report galvanized international research and policy, leading to the development of numerous SDoH frameworks and screening tools, including those used today in diabetes care [[3,14]].\n\nIn the United States, the focus sharpened on specific chronic diseases, with diabetes becoming a prominent area of study. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) published its first major scientific statement on the socioecological determinants of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in 2013, signaling a commitment to integrating SDoH into diabetes research and clinical practice [[3]]. This was followed by a series of reports and recommendations emphasizing the need for routine screening for SDoH in clinical settings [[23]]. The historical trajectory shows a clear progression from a general acknowledgment of social influences on health to a detailed, data-driven examination of specific pathways and mechanisms linking poverty, housing instability, and food insecurity to diabetes pathophysiology and management.\n\nHowever, despite the progress spurred by these milestones, the implementation of SDoH-focused policies has faced significant headwinds. One of the most persistent critiques of the SDoH framework is that it has failed to substantially diminish health inequalities in most societies over the past decade [[5]]. This suggests that while the framework provides a compelling diagnosis, the prescribed remedies have been slow to materialize or lack sufficient political will. Political resistance has been a major barrier, exemplified by the declining support for public health initiatives during the Trump administration in the U.S. [[5]]. Furthermore, institutional inertia and misaligned governance structures have hindered effective action. For example, England's 2012 Lansley reforms moved public health responsibilities to local authorities, creating a disconnect between health needs and financial resources [[5]]. There is also a lack of innovative governance models capable of managing the multisectoral nature of SDoH, which requires coordination between health, housing, education, and transportation departments—sectors that traditionally operate in silos [[5]].\n\nAnother challenge lies in the limitations of the research itself. Early SDoH studies were often descriptive, focusing on documenting inequality rather than rigorously testing the effectiveness of interventions [[5]]. Methodologies have been criticized for being inadequate for assessing the redistributive effects of structural changes and for an overreliance on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for complex social interventions, which are often impractical [[5]]. Theoretical weaknesses, such as portraying populations as passive victims of their circumstances, have also been noted [[5]]. To conclude, while the establishment of SDoH as a major public health concept was a monumental achievement, the subsequent decade has revealed the immense difficulty of translating knowledge into transformative action. The field is now at a critical juncture, tasked with moving beyond mere description to develop and implement effective, politically viable, and structurally sound solutions to the deep-rooted problems it has so clearly identified.",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The scientific study of social determinants of health and their link to diabetes relies on a sophisticated array of measurement instruments and analytical techniques. These tools are essential for quantifying the impact of social factors, validating their importance, and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. The landscape of measurement has evolved significantly, moving from broad, aggregated indicators to highly specific, validated questionnaires designed for use in clinical and research settings. A prime example of this advancement is the Diabetes Social Determinants of Health (DISDOH) Index, a 16-item tool co-developed by Clemson University, Prisma Health, and the American Diabetes Association [[2,7,11]]. The DISDOH measures five core ADA-defined domains: socioeconomic status, neighborhood and physical environment, food environment, healthcare access, and social context. Its strength lies in its validation; it demonstrates acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s α ranging from 0.66 to 0.81) and strong convergent validity with other established tools like PRAPARE and CMS-AHC-HRSN [[2]]. Critically, it is designed for feasibility and actionability, enabling clinicians to generate a total score and domain-specific scores that classify a patient's SDoH burden into four levels, thereby facilitating targeted referrals to social services [[7,11]].\n\nThe development of such tools reflects a broader trend towards standardization and integration. National committees, including the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), have recommended standardizing SDOH data collection and integrating it into electronic health records (EHRs) to build interoperable digital infrastructure across health and social care sectors [[3]]. Other notable frameworks and models used in research include the five-domain structure from Healthy People 2020 [[4]], the models from the County Health Rankings and the Kaiser Family Foundation [[12]], and a comprehensive model adapted from the KFF and Healthy People 2030 frameworks [[18]]. A comparative study using the Add Health dataset found that the Kaiser model, which uniquely included variables like stress, debt, healthcare quality, and cultural competency, accounted for the largest variance in both BMI (19%) and HbA1c (17%), outperforming other models [[12,19]]. This finding underscores the importance of selecting comprehensive and empirically validated models for predicting diabetes risk.\n\nBeyond questionnaire-based measurement, advanced analytical methods are being deployed to understand the causal pathways between SDoH and diabetes. System dynamics modeling offers a powerful tool for simulating the complex feedback loops within the SDoH system. One such model, developed with input from community experts, illustrates how factors like education, income, neighborhood conditions, and racism feed into health behaviors and ultimately determine clinical outcomes, with clinical care contributing only about 20% to overall health [[22]]. This approach allows researchers to simulate the long-term effects of interventions, showing that improvements in education or community engagement can take up to 15 years to yield perceivable health benefits, highlighting the need for sustained, long-term investment [[22]]. Another methodological advance is the use of large-scale longitudinal datasets combined with geospatial analysis. A 2025 study analyzing 11,457 U.S. census tracts found that healthcare access had the strongest association with diabetes prevalence, even after adjusting for poverty, housing, and education [[15]]. This level of precision, made possible by linking CDC PLACES data with Opportunity Insights data, allows for more granular, place-based public health planning. Technology-assisted methods, leveraging mHealth apps, wearables, and telehealth platforms, are also emerging as highly accurate tools for monitoring self-management behaviors like physical activity and medication adherence, achieving up to 88% accuracy in some studies [[8]]. These state-of-the-art methods are transforming the field, providing the rigorous evidence needed to diagnose the problem accurately and design effective, data-driven solutions.\n\n| **Social Determinant** | **Key Associated Factor(s)** | **Impact on Diabetes Risk/Outcomes** | **Source(s)** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Racial/Ethnic Disparity** | Race/ethnicity, Structural Racism | Black/African American adults 73% more likely to have diabetes; higher HbA1c levels; increased mortality.

      "content": "The application of SDoH principles in diabetes care has moved from theoretical discussion to practical implementation, with numerous case studies and structured programs demonstrating their potential to improve patient outcomes. The fundamental premise is that by identifying and addressing the non-clinical barriers to health, providers can enhance a patient's capacity to manage their condition effectively. A landmark cross-sectional study conducted at an urban safety-net clinic provided a stark illustration of this principle [[4]]. Among 57 patients with uncontrolled insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, an overwhelming 92% faced at least one SDOH barrier. The most prevalent domains were Health and Health Care (84%), Economic Stability (54%), and Neighborhood and Built Environment (53%). This high burden of social adversity was strongly correlated with high levels of diabetes distress, underscoring the psychological toll of navigating these challenges. The study concluded that comprehensive screening and integrated intervention programs are urgently needed to address these multiple, interconnected barriers simultaneously [[4]].\n\nOne of the most promising applications of SDoH screening is the use of validated tools like the DISDOH index to guide targeted interventions [[7,11]]. Once a patient's specific social burdens are identified—for example, food insecurity or lack of social support—a clinician can make a direct referral to a community resource. This could involve connecting a patient with a local food bank, enrolling them in a diabetes self-management support group, or referring them to a free clinic for affordable care [[7,11]]. This approach transforms the clinical encounter from a purely biomedical transaction into a hub for coordinating holistic care. The success of such interventions is supported by evidence from structured programs. For instance, the Flourish Diabetes Programme and the JADE Program in the Asia-Pacific region have demonstrated improved patient engagement through structured interventions [[8]]. Similarly, team-based care models, which may include physicians, nurses, dietitians, and community health workers, have shown a significant reduction in HbA1c (-0.5%) along with improvements in blood pressure and cholesterol [[23]].\n\nCommunity Health Worker (CHW) programs represent another cornerstone of applied SDoH interventions. CHWs are trusted members of the community who serve as a bridge between healthcare systems and underserved populations [[3,23]]. They provide culturally competent education, facilitate navigation of complex healthcare systems, and offer crucial social support. Research consistently shows that CHW-led interventions lead to improved diabetes management and outcomes in vulnerable communities [[3]]. The impact of these programs can be amplified when combined with other strategies. One successful model involved a program that paired education, peer support, implicit bias training for providers, and streamlined workflows. This combination increased prescription rates for continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) from 15% to 69% over three years, demonstrating the power of a multi-faceted approach that addresses both patient and provider-level barriers [[17]]. These case studies collectively illustrate that applying SDoH knowledge is not about replacing medical treatment but about creating an ecosystem of support that empowers patients to engage with that treatment successfully. The most effective programs are those that are interdisciplinary, culturally attuned, and deeply integrated into the communities they serve.",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Despite significant advances in understanding the link between social determinants and diabetes, the field is fraught with profound challenges and open problems that limit its ability to translate knowledge into widespread, equitable impact. A primary critique of the SDoH framework itself is its limited explanatory power for the deepest, most intractable forms of inequality. Critics argue that the framework often fails to adequately address the role of structural racism, which acts as a master determinant shaping every other SDoH domain [[6,13]]. While SDOH models acknowledge race as a factor, they often stop short of analyzing how systemic oppression, discriminatory policies, and the legacy of slavery and segregation create and sustain health disparities [[13]]. This analytical gap means that many interventions remain surface-level, failing to dismantle the root causes of inequity. Similarly, the influence of commercial determinants of health—the profit-driven marketing of unhealthy products by corporations—is largely absent from mainstream SDoH discourse, representing a critical blind spot in the fight against the diabetes epidemic [[24]].\n\nImplementation of SDOH-informed care faces formidable real-world obstacles. The most significant is the pervasive issue of funding and reimbursement. In the United States, for example, Medicaid coverage for technologies like CGMs is determined at the state level, creating a patchwork of access that is heavily dependent on geography and insurance status [[17]]. Cost is the single greatest barrier to accessing care, with private insurance plans often requiring high copays and deductibles that price out low-income individuals [[17]]. Even when technology is available, provider biases can act as a subtle but powerful barrier. Studies using vignettes have found that a majority of providers exhibit bias against patients with public insurance, assuming they cannot afford or understand complex technologies like CGMs [[17]]. This provider-perceived barrier, coupled with implicit biases detected in a third of providers, creates a chilling effect on equitable care delivery [[17]]. These issues are compounded by a lack of integrated systems; without interoperable digital infrastructure connecting health and social service data, it is nearly impossible to coordinate care effectively [[3]].\n\nMethodological and research-related weaknesses also constrain progress. The field has been critiqued for an overreliance on descriptive epidemiology and a failure to conduct rigorous evaluations of complex, multi-level interventions [[5]]. Many studies employ cross-sectional designs, which are ill-suited for establishing causality or understanding the long-term impact of interventions [[8]]. There is a recognized deficit in methodologies like realist evaluation, which is better suited for understanding *how*, *for whom*, and *under what circumstances* an intervention works [[5]]. Furthermore, there is a tendency to view populations as passive victims of their environment, rather than as active agents capable of resilience and change [[5]]. Funding priorities also play a role, with conservative funding bodies sometimes overlooking the most innovative but politically sensitive research on redistribution and structural change [[5]]. Finally, the dominance of English-language publications and disciplinary silos hinder the dissemination of knowledge from diverse contexts and the formation of the kind of transdisciplinary collaborations needed to tackle the multifaceted nature of SDoH [[5]]. Overcoming these challenges requires not only better research but also a fundamental shift in funding priorities, professional training, and the political will to confront the structural roots of health inequity.",

      "content": "In conclusion, the extensive body of evidence reviewed here unequivocally establishes social determinants of health as a cornerstone of diabetes epidemiology and management. The journey from recognizing the influence of social conditions on health to meticulously mapping their specific pathways has been marked by significant scientific and clinical progress. We now possess validated tools like the DISDOH index to measure social burden, we have identified key determinants like structural racism and commercial pressures as critical drivers of disparity, and we have developed promising, albeit challenging, interventions centered on community health workers and integrated care models [[7,13,17]]. However, the overarching challenge remains: the translation of this wealth of knowledge into equitable, population-wide impact. The path forward requires a concerted effort to address the field's most pressing gaps and to embrace new paradigms for research and action.\n\nFuture research must prioritize several key areas. First, there is a critical need to establish consensus on definitions and metrics for root causes like structural racism and commercial determinants of health [[3]]. Without standardized measures, it is difficult to compare findings across studies or track progress over time. Second, research should move beyond descriptive studies to adopt more sophisticated methodologies, such as realist evaluation and quasi-experimental designs, to rigorously test the effectiveness of multi-level interventions [[5,13]]. Third, a greater emphasis must be placed on next-generation research that examines the specific mechanisms through which policies like Medicaid expansion or minimum wage laws affect diabetes outcomes [[13]]. Fourth, the field must invest heavily in dissemination and implementation science to understand how to embed SDOH screening and interventions into routine clinical practice, especially in resource-constrained safety-net settings [[3]].\n\nPerhaps the most important future direction is a paradigm shift from a primarily clinical focus to a multisector and all-of-government approach [[6]]. Addressing the root causes of diabetes requires collaboration far beyond the walls of hospitals and clinics. This includes partnerships with urban planners to redesign neighborhoods for physical activity, advocates for food policy to regulate the marketing of unhealthy products, and policymakers to enact legislation that promotes health equity [[24,25]]. Training the next generation of researchers and clinicians in structural competency—a framework that equips them to identify and analyze the impact of structural factors on health—is essential for fostering these interdisciplinary alliances [[21]]. In summary, while the scientific community has done an excellent job of diagnosing the problem, the next frontier is in developing and implementing the complex, coordinated, and politically courageous solutions required to cure it. The ultimate goal is not merely to treat diabetes in a diverse population, but to create a society where everyone has the opportunity to achieve their full health potential, regardless of their zip code, income, or race.\n\n---",
