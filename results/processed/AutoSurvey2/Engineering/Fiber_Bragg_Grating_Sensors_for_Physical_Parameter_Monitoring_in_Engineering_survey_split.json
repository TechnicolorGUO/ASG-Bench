While the focus of this survey is on Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors, the broader field of sensor data analysis and interpretation has seen significant advancements, many of which are directly applicable to the development and optimization of FBG-based monitoring systems. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of machine learning models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to process real-time sensor data with high accuracy and efficiency. For instance, the implementation of an RNN in firmware for energy computation in the ATLAS experiment highlights the feasibility of deploying such models in hardware, enabling low-latency and high-throughput data processing [12]. This approach could be adapted to FBG sensors, where rapid and accurate interpretation of strain, temperature, or vibration data is critical. In the domain of industrial monitoring, the use of Federated Learning (FL) for autoencoder-based condition monitoring has emerged as a promising technique, allowing for distributed training across edge devices without compromising data privacy or requiring centralized data storage [2]. This is particularly relevant for FBG sensor networks deployed in geographically distributed or sensitive environments, where data security and communication efficiency are paramount. Similarly, the integration of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has shown how domain knowledge can be embedded into data-driven models, improving their accuracy and generalization capabilities [3]. Such approaches could enhance the reliability of FBG sensor data interpretation by incorporating physical constraints and governing equations, thereby reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Sensor placement and spatial-temporal data modeling have also seen significant improvements, with methods like Convolutional Gaussian Neural Processes (ConvGNP) offering superior performance in capturing non-stationary patterns in environmental data [7]. These techniques could be adapted to optimize the deployment of FBG sensors in complex structures, ensuring maximum coverage and minimal redundancy. Moreover, the increasing use of probabilistic models in sensor data analysis, such as Bayesian autoencoders and physics-informed neural networks, suggests a growing trend toward uncertainty-aware and interpretable systems [8] [6]. This is crucial for engineering applications where sensor reliability and fault detection are essential. The development of deep learning models for perception tasks, such as 6D pose estimation for grasping transparent objects, further illustrates the potential of neural networks in handling complex and noisy sensor data [4]. While this particular application is not directly related to FBG sensors, the underlying techniques could be applied to improve the accuracy of FBG-based monitoring in challenging environments, such as those with dynamic or uncertain conditions. Additionally, the use of graph-based models, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown promise in modeling complex interactions between sensor nodes, potentially enabling more efficient and scalable FBG sensor networks [5]. Overall, the convergence of machine learning, physics-based modeling, and distributed computing is redefining the landscape of sensor-based monitoring systems. These advancements not only enhance the accuracy and efficiency of data processing but also address critical challenges such as data privacy, real-time performance, and system scalability. As the field of FBG sensors continues to evolve, integrating these cutting-edge techniques will be essential for achieving robust, reliable, and intelligent monitoring solutions in engineering applications.",

      "content": "The future of Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors for physical parameter monitoring in engineering is poised to benefit significantly from recent advancements in machine learning and data-driven modeling. As the demand for real-time, accurate, and reliable monitoring systems grows across civil, mechanical, and aerospace engineering applications, the integration of advanced computational techniques with FBG sensor technology presents a promising direction. One key area of development lies in the fusion of physics-based models with data-driven approaches, such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which have demonstrated robustness to noise and limited data [10]. This synergy can enhance the predictive capabilities of FBG sensors, particularly in scenarios where sensor data may be sparse or corrupted by environmental factors. Another critical direction involves the application of graph-based and spatio-temporal models to better capture the complex interactions within distributed FBG sensor networks. Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs), for instance, have shown the ability to forecast unobserved node states by leveraging the inherent structure and dynamics of the network [9]. Such models can be particularly useful in large-scale structural health monitoring systems, where the spatial distribution of sensors and their temporal behavior are essential for accurate diagnosis and prediction. The use of Bayesian methods and uncertainty quantification is also expected to play a vital role in the future of FBG sensor systems. Techniques such as Bayesian SINDy autoencoders have demonstrated effectiveness in discovering governing equations and latent coordinates from data while providing uncertainty estimates [8]. This capability is crucial for safety-critical applications where the reliability of sensor data and the confidence in model predictions are paramount. Moreover, the increasing focus on efficiency and scalability in machine learning models suggests that future FBG sensor systems may incorporate lightweight and optimized architectures. For example, frequency-domain-based Transformers have shown promise in improving computational efficiency while maintaining high performance [10]. Such approaches could enable real-time processing of large-scale FBG data streams, making them more suitable for embedded and edge computing environments. Additionally, the integration of deep learning with traditional signal processing techniques could lead to more sophisticated methods for interpreting FBG signals. Approaches that combine the strengths of neural networks with domain-specific knowledge, such as those seen in physics-informed pathloss prediction [11], may offer new opportunities for improving the accuracy and interpretability of FBG-based monitoring systems. Overall, the future of FBG sensors in engineering monitoring will likely be shaped by the continued convergence of sensor technology with advanced computational methods. The exploration of hybrid models that integrate physical principles, graph-based representations, and efficient learning architectures will be essential in addressing the challenges of noise, data scarcity, and scalability.
