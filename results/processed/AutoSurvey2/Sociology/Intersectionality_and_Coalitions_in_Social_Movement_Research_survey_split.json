      "content": "The study of social movements has long been enriched by the recognition that individuals and groups do not experience social structures in isolation but rather through intersecting systems of power, identity, and oppression. Intersectionality, a framework initially developed by Kimberlé Crenshaw, has become a cornerstone in understanding how multiple axes of identity—such as race, gender, class, and sexuality—interact to shape experiences of marginalization and privilege. As social movement research evolves, the need to account for these intersections becomes increasingly critical, not only in analyzing the dynamics of movement participation but also in fostering inclusive and effective coalitions. This survey explores the growing body of literature that bridges intersectionality with coalition-building, examining how scholars and practitioners conceptualize, analyze, and operationalize these complex social phenomena. The integration of intersectional perspectives into social movement research has prompted a reevaluation of traditional approaches, which often assumed a monolithic or singular identity for participants. Instead, contemporary studies emphasize the multiplicity of identities and the ways in which they influence both individual agency and collective action. This shift has led to a deeper engagement with the structural and cultural dimensions of social inequality, as well as the development of more nuanced methodologies for studying movement dynamics. A key area of focus in recent research has been the role of computational and quantitative methods in analyzing social networks, team coordination, and collective intelligence. For instance, studies on interbrain networks have introduced geometric and entropy-based frameworks to measure neural interactions during social exchanges, offering new insights into the cognitive underpinnings of collective behavior [4]. Similarly, research on spatial coordination in teams has revealed how implicit patterns of movement and proximity can enhance or hinder group performance, suggesting that physical and social dynamics are deeply intertwined [3]. These findings have broader implications for understanding how social movements form and sustain themselves, as they highlight the importance of both cognitive and spatial dimensions in collective action. In parallel, the computational foundations of collective intelligence have demonstrated that groups often outperform individuals due to their ability to pool diverse resources and perspectives [1]. This insight underscores the value of diversity within coalitions, as it suggests that heterogeneous groups are better equipped to navigate complex social challenges. However, the benefits of diversity are not automatically realized; they require intentional strategies to foster inclusion and equity. This is where intersectional approaches become particularly relevant, as they challenge researchers and activists to move beyond surface-level diversity metrics and instead consider how power relations and systemic inequalities shape the experiences of different group members. One of the most pressing concerns in this context is the issue of algorithmic fairness, particularly in the development of machine learning models that aim to support social movements or simulate collective behavior. Recent studies have highlighted the limitations of traditional fairness metrics in addressing intersectional disparities, arguing that models must account for the overlapping and compounding effects of multiple forms of discrimination [2]. This has led to the development of novel regularization techniques that explicitly incorporate intersectional considerations, such as joint distance covariance and concatenated distance covariance, to mitigate bias in algorithmic decision-making. These advancements not only have implications for technology but also for the broader field of social movement research, as they demonstrate the potential for computational tools to support more equitable and representative coalition-building efforts. Another significant area of development is the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate population-aligned personas for social simulations. By creating realistic and diverse representations of individuals, these models can help researchers better understand the complexities of identity and behavior within social movements [5]. However, the potential for bias in LLM-generated content remains a critical challenge, as these models can inadvertently reinforce stereotypes or fail to capture the full range of human experiences. This underscores the need for careful validation and ongoing refinement of simulation tools to ensure that they accurately reflect the diversity and dynamism of social realities. As the field continues to evolve, there is a growing recognition of the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing the multifaceted nature of intersectionality and coalitions. Researchers from neuroscience, computer science, social science, and computational modeling are increasingly working together to develop new frameworks and methodologies that can capture the complexity of human interaction. This integration of perspectives has not only expanded the scope of social movement research but also enriched the theoretical and practical tools available to those seeking to create more inclusive and effective movements. Ultimately, the intersection of intersectionality and coalitions in social movement research represents a dynamic and evolving field that challenges scholars to rethink traditional assumptions and embrace more holistic, equitable, and inclusive approaches to understanding and supporting collective action. By drawing on diverse methodologies and theoretical insights, this area of study holds great promise for advancing both academic knowledge and practical applications in the pursuit of social justice.",

In recent years, the integration of computational methods into social movement research has opened new avenues for analyzing how individuals and groups interact, organize, and advocate for change. This shift is particularly evident in the growing emphasis on intersectionality—a framework that recognizes the overlapping and interdependent systems of discrimination or disadvantage that shape individuals' experiences. Intersectionality has become a central concept in social movement scholarship, as it underscores the necessity of considering multiple, intersecting identities such as race, gender, class, and geography when examining collective action and coalition-building. The increasing use of advanced computational techniques, including vision-language models, large language models, and bandit algorithms, has enabled researchers to analyze social dynamics at scale, offering deeper insights into the mechanisms of participation, representation, and equity in social movements. These technologies have been applied to a range of contexts, from detecting social groups in urban environments to tracing the evolution of ideas in deliberative assemblies, and from mitigating biases in generative AI to improving volunteer engagement in food rescue initiatives. While these approaches differ in their focus and methodologies, they collectively highlight the importance of understanding social movements as dynamic, multilayered phenomena influenced by both human behavior and technological mediation. The intersection of computational methods with intersectional theory has not only expanded the scope of social movement research but also raised critical questions about representation, fairness, and the ethical implications of algorithmic interventions in social contexts. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of diverse perspectives and methodologies will be essential in addressing the complexities of coalition-building and ensuring that social movements remain inclusive and responsive to the needs of all participants.",

      "content": "The current state of the art in research on intersectionality and coalitions in social movement studies reflects a growing interdisciplinary engagement with computational methods, ethical considerations, and the complex interplay of identity, power, and systemic oppression. Recent studies have increasingly recognized the limitations of single-axis approaches to fairness and representation, emphasizing instead the necessity of intersectional frameworks that account for overlapping systems of marginalization. This shift is evident in the development of computational tools and analytical methods that integrate intersectionality into algorithmic decision-making, discourse analysis, and policy evaluation. For instance, QUINTA represents a significant step forward by operationalizing intersectionality within AI research through reflexive praxis, demonstrating how researchers can mitigate the risks of reinforcing systemic biases by critically examining their own positions and practices [11]. Similarly, APFEx introduces a novel approach to intersectional fairness by modeling it as a multi-objective optimization problem, offering a technical framework that addresses the compounded effects of bias in algorithmic systems [6]. These contributions underscore the increasing recognition that fairness cannot be considered in isolation but must account for the complex, layered realities of social identity. Computational methods have become central to understanding and analyzing social movements, particularly through the use of large language models (LLMs) to process and interpret large-scale textual data. The study on framing migration, for example, employs LLMs to conduct a computational analysis of UK parliamentary discourse, revealing how migration narratives have evolved over time and how ideological divides shape these representations [8]. This approach highlights the potential of computational tools to uncover patterns and trends in political discourse that may be difficult to detect through traditional qualitative methods. Furthermore, the use of LLMs in assessing historical structural oppression through rule-guided prompting demonstrates their capacity to engage with complex social and historical data in a structured and interpretable manner [10]. These developments suggest that LLMs are not only tools for automation but also platforms for critical inquiry into social justice issues. In parallel, there is a strong emphasis on ethical responsibility and reflexivity in data-driven research. QUINTA and related works stress the importance of researchers’ awareness of their own biases and the power dynamics embedded in data and models, arguing that ethical considerations must be integral to the research process [11]. This perspective aligns with broader discussions on the role of data science in perpetuating or challenging systemic inequalities, reinforcing the idea that the design and implementation of computational systems are inherently political. At the same time, the rise of model-agnostic frameworks such as APFEx indicates a trend toward developing tools that can be applied across different contexts and systems, enhancing the scalability and adaptability of intersectional approaches [6]. This is particularly important in the context of social movements, where coalitions often involve diverse stakeholders with varying needs and priorities. Another notable trend is the integration of computational methods into the study of social policy and public action. For example, research on machine learning for public policy has explored how targeted interventions, such as mental health outreach in incarceration settings, can be informed by data-driven models [9]. These studies highlight the potential of computational tools to support more equitable and effective policy outcomes, particularly when designed with intersectional considerations in mind. Similarly, the use of hybrid retrieval systems in social media platforms, such as the modernization of Facebook scoped search, demonstrates how combining keyword and embedding-based approaches can enhance the relevance and diversity of information retrieval, with LLMs playing a key role in evaluating the quality of these results [7]. These applications illustrate the expanding role of computational methods in shaping the digital public sphere and, by extension, the conditions for social movement formation and coalition-building. Overall, the current state of the art in intersectionality and coalitions in social movement research is marked by a convergence of technical innovation, ethical reflection, and sociopolitical awareness. The field is moving beyond the mere identification of biases to the development of actionable frameworks that can be integrated into both algorithmic systems and policy practices. While there are still challenges in translating these insights into real-world applications, the growing body of work suggests that computational methods, when guided by intersectional principles, can contribute significantly to more inclusive and equitable social systems. As the research continues to evolve, the interplay between technical, ethical, and political dimensions will remain central to advancing the understanding and practice of intersectionality in social movement contexts.",

      "content": "The future of intersectionality and coalitions in social movement research is poised at the intersection of social theory, computational modeling, and empirical analysis. As the field evolves, it becomes increasingly clear that the complexities of social movements cannot be fully captured through traditional sociological frameworks alone. Instead, emerging computational tools and interdisciplinary approaches offer new pathways for understanding how multiple axes of identity, power, and resistance interact within collective action. Recent studies have demonstrated that social movements are not monolithic entities but dynamic, multi-layered processes shaped by intersecting structures of inequality, cultural norms, and institutional constraints. This realization necessitates a shift in research paradigms, one that integrates both qualitative and quantitative methods to better capture the fluidity and diversity of coalition-building efforts. One of the most pressing challenges in this domain is the need for methodological rigor in the analysis of social movements, particularly as computational models—such as large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent simulations—become more prevalent. The PIMMUR principles, for instance, highlight the importance of designing simulations that account for agent heterogeneity, interaction dynamics, and the validity of collective behavior outcomes [16]. These principles underscore the necessity of adopting structured, transparent methodologies when using AI to model social phenomena, ensuring that such models do not inadvertently reinforce existing biases or oversimplify complex realities. Similarly, the Narcissus Hypothesis raises critical questions about the extent to which AI systems, including those used in social movement research, may internalize and reflect socially constructed norms, thereby shaping rather than merely reflecting societal trends [14]. This suggests that researchers must be vigilant in scrutinizing not only the data but also the epistemological foundations of the models they employ. Another significant development lies in the recognition of contextual sensitivity. Social movements and their coalitions are deeply embedded in specific historical, cultural, and political contexts, and their dynamics cannot be generalized across different settings. The recent reexamination of the Broken Windows Theory using machine learning techniques illustrates how even well-established sociological theories must be re-evaluated in light of new data and methodologies [12]. This calls for a more nuanced approach to social movement research, one that acknowledges the variability of outcomes and the need for localized, adaptive strategies. In this regard, the application of AI in social movement analysis offers both opportunities and risks. On one hand, AI can help identify patterns, track sentiment, and model interactions at scale. On the other hand, it can also perpetuate biases if not carefully designed and validated. The role of computational tools in understanding coalition dynamics is another area that demands further exploration. The Coopetitive-Compatible Data Generation Framework, for example, demonstrates how economic incentives and collaborative frameworks can be balanced to improve the quality of AI-driven data generation in federated learning environments [17]. This has direct implications for social movement research, where data sharing and collaboration across different groups are often essential for building effective coalitions. However, such collaborations are not without challenges, particularly when diverse stakeholders have conflicting interests. Future research should therefore investigate how AI can facilitate more equitable and inclusive data practices, while also addressing the power imbalances that often characterize coalition-building processes. Moreover, the increasing use of AI in political discourse and public policy raises important questions about the role of technology in shaping social movements. The longitudinal study of large language models during the 2024 US Election Season reveals how AI systems can be influenced by demographic steering and evolving political contexts [18]. This highlights the need for researchers to consider the broader socio-political implications of AI, particularly in how it may be used to either support or undermine grassroots movements. As AI systems become more integrated into public life, their capacity to influence public opinion, mobilize resources, and shape collective action will only grow. Therefore, future studies must explore how these systems can be designed and regulated to support, rather than obstruct, the goals of social movements and their coalitions. Finally, the integration of cognitive and linguistic models into social movement research presents a promising avenue for future inquiry. The Cognitive Linguistic Identity Fusion Score (CLIFS), for instance, offers a scalable method for quantifying identity fusion from text, which could be instrumental in understanding how individuals within a movement come to share a collective identity [13]. Similarly, the development of multimodal reasoning systems, such as those explored in Conversational Orientation Reasoning, may provide new insights into how communication strategies influence coalition formation and effectiveness [15]. These advancements suggest that the future of social movement research will be increasingly shaped by the convergence of AI, linguistics, and social theory, opening up new possibilities for both empirical analysis and theoretical innovation.

      "content": "The conclusion of the survey paper on \"Intersectionality and Coalitions in Social Movement Research\" synthesizes the key findings and contributions that have emerged from the evolving discourse on how intersecting identities shape collective action and social change. The paper underscores that intersectionality has moved beyond a theoretical construct to become an essential analytical tool in understanding the dynamics of social movements. It highlights how coalitions are not merely strategic alliances but are deeply influenced by the intersecting structures of power, identity, and oppression. The integration of computational methods has further enhanced the ability to model and analyze these complex interactions, offering new insights into the formation, sustainability, and impact of social movements. The current state of the field reflects a growing recognition of the limitations of single-axis approaches, with a stronger emphasis on intersectional frameworks that account for the multiplicity of identities and experiences. Researchers are increasingly adopting interdisciplinary methodologies that combine qualitative and quantitative approaches, enabling a more nuanced understanding of how social movements operate in diverse contexts. However, challenges remain, particularly in addressing the ethical implications of computational modeling and ensuring that intersectional analyses do not inadvertently reinforce systemic biases. Looking ahead, future research should focus on developing more inclusive and equitable computational models that reflect the lived realities of marginalized communities. There is also a need for greater collaboration across disciplines to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and empirical applications. Additionally, the field must grapple with the complexities of power dynamics within coalitions, ensuring that all voices are represented and that movements remain responsive to the needs of those most affected by systemic oppression. In conclusion, the study of intersectionality and coalitions in social movement research is at a critical juncture, offering both significant opportunities and pressing challenges. As the field continues to evolve, it must remain committed to fostering inclusive, equitable, and transformative social change. By centering intersectionality in both theory and practice, researchers can contribute to a more just and inclusive understanding of collective action in an increasingly complex world.",
