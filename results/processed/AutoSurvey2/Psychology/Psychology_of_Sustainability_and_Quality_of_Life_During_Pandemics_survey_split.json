      "content": "The ongoing global challenges posed by pandemics have underscored the intricate relationship between human psychology, sustainability, and quality of life. As societies grapple with the physical, emotional, and economic consequences of infectious disease outbreaks, there is a growing need to understand how psychological factors influence individual and collective responses to such crises. This survey paper explores the evolving field of the psychology of sustainability and quality of life during pandemics, drawing on interdisciplinary insights from psychology, public health, and computational sciences. The intersection of these domains has become increasingly relevant, as the psychological impacts of pandemics—ranging from anxiety and depression to changes in social behavior and environmental consciousness—have significant implications for long-term societal resilience and sustainable development. Recent research has highlighted the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in modeling and predicting these complex dynamics, offering new tools to analyze human behavior and inform policy decisions. For instance, data augmentation strategies have been employed to improve the reliability of epidemic forecasting, demonstrating the potential of computational methods to enhance public health responses [2]. Similarly, large language models (LLMs) have been utilized to conduct structured scenario analyses and generate policy recommendations, illustrating the growing integration of AI in decision-making processes [1]. These developments reflect a broader trend in the application of AI to understand and address human-centric challenges, particularly in times of crisis. The psychological dimensions of sustainability are also being redefined in light of pandemic experiences. Research has shown that environmental factors, such as air quality and urban safety, are closely linked to mental health and well-being, with large multimodal models offering new ways to assess these relationships [4]. At the same time, the ethical and societal implications of AI-driven solutions have become a critical area of concern, as issues of bias, representativeness, and responsible deployment come to the forefront [1]. The interplay between technology and human behavior during pandemics has also raised questions about the trade-offs between model efficiency and interpretability, as seen in studies comparing machine learning and deep learning approaches for mental illness detection on social media [5]. These studies reveal the complexity of modeling human psychological states, where accuracy must be balanced with the need for transparency and explainability. Furthermore, the use of AI in understanding and shaping public perception has become increasingly important, as seen in the application of LLMs to simulate Delphi studies for predicting the evolution of generative AI [3]. This approach highlights the potential of AI to facilitate structured reasoning and foresight, which is essential for developing effective responses to future crises. As the field continues to evolve, it is clear that the psychology of sustainability and quality of life during pandemics is a multifaceted and rapidly developing area of research. The integration of computational methods with psychological and sociological insights offers new opportunities to understand human behavior, improve policy-making, and enhance the resilience of communities in the face of global health challenges. This survey paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the key themes, methodologies, and challenges in this emerging field, while highlighting the potential for future research and innovation.",

      "content": "The psychology of sustainability and quality of life during pandemics is a rapidly evolving field that intersects with multiple disciplines, including psychology, public health, environmental science, and artificial intelligence. The unprecedented challenges posed by global health crises have underscored the need to understand how individuals and communities adapt to prolonged stress, uncertainty, and social disruption. These factors not only influence mental health and well-being but also shape behaviors related to environmental stewardship, public health compliance, and social cohesion. As such, the study of sustainability and quality of life during pandemics requires a multidimensional approach that considers both individual psychological responses and broader societal dynamics. Recent research has increasingly turned to data-driven methods and AI-based tools to analyze and predict human behavior under such conditions, offering new insights into how psychological factors interact with external pressures. For instance, studies have shown that AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), can be effective in promoting pro-environmental behaviors through persuasive communication, although their real-world impact remains limited by the complexity of human decision-making [8]. Similarly, the role of AI in mental health support has been explored, with findings indicating that while AI chatbots can improve the structural coherence of responses, they often fall short in providing the empathy and personalization required for effective psychological support [6]. These findings highlight the dual nature of AI as both a promising tool and a limited intervention in the context of pandemic-related psychological challenges. In addition to AI, behavioral and psychological theories have been instrumental in understanding how individuals process information, make decisions, and adapt to changing circumstances. The interplay between cognitive biases, emotional regulation, and social influences becomes particularly critical during pandemics, as individuals navigate conflicting information, isolation, and economic instability. Research in this area has also emphasized the importance of trust in public institutions, the role of misinformation, and the psychological impact of prolonged uncertainty. For example, studies have demonstrated that sentiment analysis of social media data can reveal early warning signals of public concern and resistance to health interventions, underscoring the value of real-time data in shaping policy responses [9]. Furthermore, the concept of sustainability during pandemics extends beyond environmental concerns to include social and psychological dimensions, such as the maintenance of community resilience, the preservation of mental health, and the equitable distribution of resources. Urban planning and public policy have also contributed to this discourse, with machine learning techniques being used to assess the vitality of communities and inform strategies for sustainable development [7]. These approaches illustrate the growing recognition that quality of life during pandemics is not solely a matter of health outcomes but also of social, economic, and psychological well-being. As the field continues to develop, it becomes increasingly clear that a holistic understanding of human behavior during crises is essential. This requires integrating insights from psychology, behavioral economics, and computational methods to create more effective interventions and policies. The challenges of the past few years have demonstrated that the psychological dimensions of sustainability and quality of life are not only relevant but critical in shaping the future of pandemic preparedness and response.",

      "content": "The current state of the art in the psychology of sustainability and quality of life during pandemics is marked by a growing intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and human-centered research, with a particular focus on understanding psychological resilience, social perception, and the impact of global crises on well-being. Recent studies have demonstrated how AI techniques can be leveraged to analyze complex psychological and behavioral patterns, offering new insights into how individuals and communities cope with the challenges posed by pandemics. For instance, machine learning models such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines have been successfully applied to identify psychological vulnerabilities during the COVID-19 lockdown in Spain, achieving high accuracy in predicting mental health outcomes [12]. These findings underscore the potential of AI in supporting early intervention strategies and personalized mental health care. Beyond mental health, the role of AI in fostering sustainable practices has also emerged as a critical area of research. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the development of sustainable food systems by reducing the time required for protein design tasks, although challenges remain in balancing human satisfaction with environmental impact [10]. This highlights the need for hybrid frameworks that integrate AI with traditional optimization techniques to achieve more holistic and sustainable solutions. Similarly, the application of quantum-inspired reinforcement learning in uncertain environments has opened new avenues for decision-making under ambiguity, demonstrating how principles from quantum mechanics can enhance AI's ability to navigate complex and dynamic situations [11]. In parallel, the study of human-AI interaction has gained traction, with researchers exploring how generative AI models can replicate human social perception, particularly through the lens of the valence-dominance model [11]. These models show potential in enhancing AI's capacity to understand and respond to social cues, which is particularly relevant in the context of pandemic-related social isolation and remote communication. However, the varying performance across different models and regions suggests that cultural and technical factors must be carefully considered in the development of socially aware AI systems. The ethical implications of AI in psychological and social contexts are also receiving increasing attention. Papers such as those on artificial consciousness and ethical decision-making highlight the need for responsible AI development, emphasizing the risks of misrepresentation, misuse, and the moral uncertainties that arise when AI systems are involved in human-centric tasks [13]. This underscores the importance of aligning AI technologies with human values and ensuring that their deployment supports, rather than undermines, individual and collective well-being. Overall, the current landscape reflects a dynamic interplay between AI's technical capabilities and its psychological and social implications. As the field continues to evolve, future research is likely to focus on integrating more diverse data sources, refining AI models to better capture human variability, and developing frameworks that ensure ethical and equitable outcomes. The convergence of AI with psychological and sustainability research presents a unique opportunity to enhance both individual quality of life and the broader societal resilience during and after pandemics.",

      "content": "The future of research on the psychology of sustainability and quality of life during pandemics must integrate insights from multiple disciplines, including psychology, economics, artificial intelligence, and public policy. As the global landscape continues to evolve in response to emerging crises, the need for adaptive, resilient, and ethically guided systems becomes increasingly urgent. Recent studies highlight the importance of understanding how human behavior, decision-making, and psychological well-being are shaped by dynamic and uncertain environments, particularly in the context of pandemics. This calls for a more holistic approach that considers both individual and collective responses to sustained stressors, as well as the role of technology in shaping these responses. One promising direction is the development of adaptive models that account for the interplay between human decisions and environmental dynamics. Decision-dependent stochastic optimization, for instance, offers a framework for understanding how choices can influence the distribution of outcomes over time [17]. Such models could be applied to public health interventions, where policy decisions directly impact the spread of disease, mental health trends, and societal well-being. By incorporating real-time feedback and adjusting to shifting conditions, these models may enhance the effectiveness of sustainability strategies and support long-term quality of life. Another critical area for future research lies in the ethical and psychological implications of emerging technologies, particularly in the context of mental health and well-being. The use of interpretable machine learning models, such as I-HOPE, has demonstrated the potential to provide personalized insights into mental health, enabling more targeted and effective interventions [16]. However, as AI systems become more integrated into psychological support and healthcare, concerns around transparency, accountability, and bias must be addressed. The ethical considerations raised in works like \"Dubito Ergo Sum\" and \"Decoding the Black Box\" underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how AI systems perceive and respond to human behavior, particularly in high-stakes scenarios [14], [15]. Moreover, the economic and existential risks associated with transformative technologies, as discussed in \"The Economics of p(doom),\" suggest that future research must also consider the long-term implications of technological development on societal stability and well-being [18]. This includes evaluating how AI-driven systems might influence economic resilience, resource allocation, and public trust during crises. The integration of economic risk modeling with psychological and behavioral data could lead to more robust strategies for sustaining quality of life during and after pandemics. Additionally, the growing reliance on AI in healthcare and mental health support necessitates a reevaluation of how these systems are designed, deployed, and regulated. The potential for AI to enhance collaboration, decision-making, and knowledge sharing in non-profit healthcare organizations is significant [19], but it also raises important questions about fairness, equity, and the role of human oversight. Future work should explore how AI can be aligned with human values and ethical principles to ensure that technological advancements contribute positively to psychological sustainability and collective well-being. In summary, the future of research on the psychology of sustainability and quality of life during pandemics must be interdisciplinary, adaptive, and ethically grounded. By leveraging advances in machine learning, economic modeling, and AI governance, researchers can develop more effective and equitable solutions to support individuals and communities in times of crisis. This requires not only technical innovation but also a deeper understanding of the psychological and social dimensions of sustainability, ensuring that technology serves as a tool for resilience rather than a source of additional stress or inequality.",
